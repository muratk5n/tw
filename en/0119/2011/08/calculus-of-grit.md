# The Calculus of Grit

Venkatesh Rao's Blog

I think I now understand the reason I reject the generalist label and
resonate far more with the specialist label. The generalist/specialist
distinction is an extrinsic coordinate system for mapping human
potential. This system itself is breaking down, so we have to
reconstruct whatever meaning the distinction had in intrinsic
terms. When I chart my life course using such intrinsic notions, I end
up clearly a (reconstructed) specialist [..].

Extrinsically situated creativity with reference to some global,
absolute scheme of generalist/specialist dimensions is unworkable. At
best we can hope for local, relative schemes and an idea of
intrinsically situated individual lives [..].

The problem with this generalist/specialist extrinsically situated
creativity model is that the extrinsic frames of references are
getting increasingly dynamic, chaotic and murky. To the point that the
distinction is becoming useless. Nobody seems to know which way is up,
which way is down, and which way is sideways. If you guess and get
lucky, the answers may change next year, leaving you disoriented once
more [..].

So given that most excitement centers around short-lived fruitfly
non-disciplines, how do people even manage to log 10,000 deliberate
practice hours in any coherent journey to mastery? Can you jump across
three or four fruit-fly domains over the course of a decade and still
end up with mastery of something, even if you cannot define it?

Yes. If you drop extrinsic frames of reference altogether.

We need another supporting notion before we can construct an intrinsic
coordinate system for human lives [..].

You might wake up one fine day and realize that your life, which makes
no sense in nominal terms, actually adds up to expertise in some
domain you’d never identified with at all [.. A]t some point I
realized with a shock that I had accidentally logged several thousand
hours along a marketing career path without realizing it. I had just
completely misunderstood what “marketing” meant based on the popular
image the field presents to novices [..]

If there is no external frame of reference, how do you know where you
are, where you are going and whether you are progressing at all, as
opposed to bumming around? Can you log any old time-sheet of 10,000
hours, slap a label on it, and claim mastery? Thankfully, intrinsic
navigation is not quite that trite. Grit is the enduring intrinsic
quality that, for a brief period in recent history, was coincident
with the pattern of behavior known as progressive disciplinary
specialization [..Grit is] probably the best predictor of success in
the modern world [..].

Grit has external connotations of extreme toughness, a high apparent
threshold for pain, and an ability to keep picking yourself up after
getting knocked down. From the outside, grit looks like the
bloody-minded exercise of extreme will power. It looks like a
super-power [..].

But the subjective feel of grit is not my concern here. I am
interested in objective, intrinsically measurable aspects of grit [..]
In endeavor space, field, domain and years of experience get replaced
by three variables that lend themselves to a convenient new 3Rs
acronym: reworking, referencing, releasing [..] What does navigating
by these three variables look like from the outside?

If you only do a lot of internal referencing, that’s like marching
along a straight, level road. If you do a lot of internal referencing
and a lot of rework, that’s like marching along a steady uphill road
that’s gradually getting steeper from an external point of view (in
other words, you are on your own exponential path of progress). What
you are doing will look impossible to observers. It may look like you
are marching up a vertical cliff [..].

The environment that really matters isn’t the external world. It is
pretty much pure noise. You can easily find and process the subset
that is meaningful for your life. It isn’t about harder, smarter,
faster. If it were, I’d be dead. I’ve been getting lazier, dumber and
slower [..]. Exhortation is pointless. Humans don’t suddenly become
super-human just because the environment suddenly seems to demand
superhuman behavior for survival. Those who attempt this kill
themselves just as surely as those dumb kids who watch a superman
movie and jump off buildings hoping to fly [..].


It is the landscape of your own strengths that matters. And you can
set your own, completely human pace through it [..].

The only truly new behavior you need is increased introspection. And
yes, this will advantage some people over others. To avoid running
faster and faster until you die of exhaustion, you need to develop an
increasingly refined understanding of this landscape as you
progress. You twist and turn as you walk (not run) primarily to find
the path of least resistance on the landscape of your strengths [..].

The only truly new belief you need is that the landscape of
disciplinary endeavors and achievement is meaningless. If you are too
attached to degrees, medals, prizes, prestigious titles and other
extrinsic markers of progress in your life, you might as well give up
now. With 90% probability you aren’t going to make it. It’s simple
math: even if they were worth it, as our friend [Tom] Friedman notes
with his characteristic scare-mongering, there simply isn’t enough to
go around [..]

If you’re paying attention to the Chinese kids who score a perfect
800, you’re paying attention to the wrong people. I mean, really? You
should worry about some Chinese kid terrorized into achieving a
perfect-800 math score by some Tiger Mom, and applying to Grinnell
College?

It’s the Chinese kids who are rebelling against their Tiger Moms,
completely ignoring the SAT, and flowing down the path of least
resistance that you should be worried about. After all Sun Tzu
invented that whole idea [..].

So rework, reference, release. Flow through the landscape of your own
strengths and weaknesses. Count to 10,000 rework hours as you walk. If
you aren’t seeing accelerating external results by hour 3300, stop and
introspect. That is the calculus of grit. It’s the exponential human
psychology you need for exponential times. Ignore everything else.
