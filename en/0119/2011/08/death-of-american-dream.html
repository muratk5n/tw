<h1>The Death of the American Dream</h1>
<p>The news from the housing market this week is bad. Really bad. House
prices today are lower in most of the country than they were in the
dismal month of April 2009; we are now in the second dip of the double
dip housing downturn [..].</p>
<p>For eighty years we have defined the American dream as an owner
occupied family home, preferably with a nice swathe of crabgrass-free
lawn around it. The home mortgage was the centerpiece of a society of
consumers based on debt-financed living. It was life on the
installment plan. The latest downturn in the housing market is one
more grim signal that in its current form, the American Dream is going
the way of the dodo.</p>
<p>A home of your own increasingly means a home of the bank’s. Today some
86 million Americans live in homes that are ‘under water’ where the
amount owed on the mortgage is greater than the value of the
house. Since the financial crisis began in 2008, over one million
consumer mortgages have gone into foreclosure. Sales of bank-owned
properties are now 34.5 percent of the housing market; homes in
foreclosure waiting for resale now account for a three years-supply on
the sluggish housing market [..].</p>
<p>[T]he Dream 2.0 [Dream 1.0 was owning a farm] [was about] home
ownership in the suburbs accompanied by a consumer lifestyle based on
credit card debt and the installment plan, anchored by a white or blue
collar ‘good’ job. Once again federal policy aimed to make the
American dream open to any white male: jobs were to be plentiful and
mortgages cheap. Over time, we’ve extended the concept: you don’t have
to be white or male to qualify for a good job but American social
policy as a whole is recognizably an adaptation of our family farming
heritage to the age of manufacturing.</p>
<p>Now the 2.0 Dream is on the skids — and, as was the case with the
death of the family farm, more than one force is at work.</p>
<p>Part of it is the breakup of the blue social model. In the heyday of
the old economy, the average American job was long term — lifetime
employment in the car factory, working for the phone company or the
local bank, or working for the government. A thirty year mortgage with
steady payments made a lot of sense in a world of lifetime
employment. Today’s careers are more volatile — even when things go
well there are ups and downs and, often, spells of unemployment
between gigs. Income growth is also unpredictable; unions are
negotiating givebacks rather than the steady raises of past
generations, and the downsizing of whole industries and the decline in
manufacturing employment means that millions of Americans must adjust
to falling incomes as life goes on. A mortgage payment that seemed
reasonable when father worked at the Chrysler plant becomes an
unmanageable burden when the plant shuts down and he gets a job at the
7-11.</p>
<p>Family structure is also changing. Divorce was rare in the American
middle class fifty years ago. A nation of kaleidoscopic family
arrangements doesn’t fit the thirty year mortgage pattern quite as
well as we used to. Divorce creates two new households at a lower
income than the original one, forces the split up of assets and
changes the nature of real estate markets. A nation with a high
divorce rate, all things being equal, is a nation of worse credit
risks than a nation which marries for life.</p>
<p>The American household is also getting smaller. More people are
remaining unmarried; many married couples are having fewer
children. While the shift to smaller households propped up house
prices for a while (smaller households mean more households are in the
housing market) it tends to reduce credit quality and slowly alters
the nature of the housing market. Single parent households have lower
incomes and are more exposed to unemployment, and single young people
tend to be more mobile than their married counterparts. Single parent,
single person and smaller households generally also tend to prefer
smaller and more easily maintained residences [..].</p>
<p>Diminishing returns were also a factor. The housing-industrial complex
wanted to keep growing; that meant expanding the market. The
government, the housing industry and the financial service industry
have all worked together to increase the percentage of American
families who own their own homes — even though that meant making
sketchier loans to more vulnerable borrowers as financial markets were
becoming more volatile [..].</p>
<p>So everybody did something wrong — but in another way, everybody is at
least partly innocent. The concept that the owner occupied house is
the natural and only home for the standard American family, and that
the financial system can and will provide fixed rate thirty year
mortgages as if it was still 1959 is almost certainly wrong [..]</p>
<p>This Great Recession, the greatest economic meltdown since the 1930s,
was touched off by a housing crisis that is intimately linked to the
breakdown of the American social model of the 2oth century and the
system of home ownership that is so deeply intertwined with it. The
recession will end at some point, but the glory days of the old model
will not return [..].</p>
<p>We are going to have to rethink the Dream going forward — this is part
of the vast process of American reconstruction that urgently needs to
get started — a process too many of our nostalgic intellectuals seem
unable to face.</p>
