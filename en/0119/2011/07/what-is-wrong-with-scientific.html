<h1>What Is Wrong With Scientific Publishing</h1>
<p><a href="https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/07/10/what-is-wrong-with-scientific-publishing-an-illustrative-true-story/">[Blog]</a></p>
<p>This blog post <em>is</em> a scholarly publication. It addresses all the
points that I feel are important – priority (not that this is
critical), peer review, communication, re-use (if you want to), and
archival (not perhaps formal, but this blog is sufficiently prominent
that it gets cached. This may horrify librarians, but it’s good enough
for me) [..].</p>
<p>So the blog post fulfils the role of communication – two way
communication – and has mechanisms for detecting and measuring
this. As I write this I imagine the community for whom I am preparing
these ideas and from whom I am hoping for feedback. Ambitiously I am
hoping that this could become a communal activity – where there are
several authors. (We do this all the time in the OKF – Etherpads,
Wikis, etc.) And who knows, this document might end up as part of a
Panton Paper.</p>
<p>I am [now] going to describe new ideas (at least for me) about
scholarly publishing [..].</p>
<p>Before my analysis I’ll give an example of the symptoms of the
dystopia. This has reinforced me in my determination never to publish
my ideas in a traditional “paper” for a conventional journal. Details
are slightly hazy. I was invited – I think in 2007 – to write an
article as part of an Issue on the progress of Open Access. I took the
invitation as an exciting opportunity to develop new ideas and to get
feedback [..] This was agreed and I would deliver my manuscript as
HTML [..] I put a LOT of work into the manuscript. The images that you
see are mainly interactive (applets, SVG, etc.). Making sure they all
work is hard. And, I’ll admit, I was late on the deadline. But I
finally got it all together and mailed it off.</p>
<p>Disallowed. It wasn’t <em>.doc. Of course it wasn’t </em>.DOC, it was
interactive HTML. The Elsevier publication process refused to allow
anything except DOC. In a rush, therefore, I destroyed my work so it
could be “published”. I deleted all the applets, SVG, etc. and put an
emasculated version into the system and turned to my “day” job –
chemical informatics – where I am at least partially in control of my
own output [..].</p>
<p>I have never heard anything more. I got no reviews (I think the editor
accepted it asis). I have no idea whether I got proofs. The paper was
published along with 7 others some months later. I have never read the
other papers, and it would now cost me 320 USD to read them (including
mine). There is an editorial (1-2 pages which also costs 40 USD). I
have never read it, so I have no idea whether the editor had any
comments.</p>
<p>Have I had any informal feedback? Someone reading the article and
mailing me?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Has anyone read the article? (I include the editor). I have no
idea. There are no figures for readership.</p>
<p>Has anyone cited the article?</p>
<p>YES – four people have cited the article! [he lists the four
sources]. I cannot read 3 of these (well it would cost ca 70 USD just
to see what the authors said), but #2 is Open. Thank you Thomas (I
imagine you had to pay to allow me to read it) [Thomas and I know each
other well in cyberspace]. It is clear that you have read my article –
or enough for your purposes [..].</p>
<p>The other three may have read it (two are crystallography
publications) or they may simply have copied the reference. It’s
interesting (not unusual) to see that the citations are 2 years post
publication).</p>
<p>So in summary, the conventional publication system consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Author expends a great deal of effort to create manuscript</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publisher “publishes it through an inhuman mechanistic process; no
  useful feedback is given</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publisher ensures that no-one can read the work unless…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>University libraries pay a large sum (probably thousands of
  dollars/annum each) to allow “free” access to an extremely small
  number of people (those in rich universities perhaps 0.0001% of the
  literate world – how many of you can read these articles sitting
  where you are?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one actually reads it [..]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing I should make it clear that Open Access [which would let
everyone to read scientific publications] in its formal sense is only
a small advance. More people can read “it”, but “it” is an outdated,
twentieth century object. It’s outlived its time. The value of
Wikipedia and Nature Precedings for me is that this has enabled a
communal journey. It’s an n&lt;-&gt;n communication process rooted in the
current century.</p>
<p>Unless “journals” change their nature (I shall explore this and I
think the most valuable thing is for them to disappear completely)
then the tectonic plates in scholarly publishing will create an
earthquake.</p>
