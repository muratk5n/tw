<h1>The forever recession (and the coming revolution)</h1>
<p>Seth Godin's Blog</p>
<p>Why do we believe that jobs where we are paid really good money to do
work that can be systemized, written in a manual and/or exported are
going to come back ever? The internet has squeezed inefficiencies out
of many systems, and the ability to move work around, coordinate
activity and digitize data all combine to eliminate a wide swath of
the jobs the industrial age created [..].</p>
<p>Factories were at the center of the industrial age. Buildings where
workers came together to efficiently craft cars, pottery, insurance
policies and organ transplants--these are job-centric activities,
places where local inefficiencies are trumped by the gains from mass
production and interchangeable parts [..].</p>
<p>It was the inefficiency caused by geography that permitted local
workers to earn a better wage, and it was the inefficiency of
imperfect communication that allowed companies to charge higher
prices.</p>
<p>The industrial age, the one that started with the industrial
revolution, is fading away. It is no longer the growth engine of the
economy and it seems absurd to imagine that great pay for replaceable
work is on the horizon. This represents a significant discontinuity, a
life-changing disappointment for hard-working people who are hoping
for stability but are unlikely to get it. It's a recession, the
recession of a hundred years of the growth of the industrial complex
[..].</p>
<p>Job creation is a false idol. The future is about gigs and assets and
art and an ever-shifting series of partnerships and projects. It will
change the fabric of our society along the way. No one is demanding
that we like the change, but the sooner we see it and set out to
become an irreplaceable linchpin, the faster the pain will fade, as we
get down to the work that needs to be (and now can be) done.</p>
<p>This revolution is at least as big as the last one, and the last one
changed everything.</p>
