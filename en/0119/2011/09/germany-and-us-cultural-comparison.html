<h1>Germany and US</h1>
<p>Axel Boldt</p>
<p>I grew up in Germany, lived there for 26 years, then moved to the
United States in 1992. First I was a graduate student and now I work
as a college teacher [..]</p>
<p>A little-known and blatantly unjust feature of the US system is
"redistricting", also called "gerrymandering". The country is divided
into congressional districts, one for each member of the House of
Parliament. The person who wins the most votes in a district gets the
corresponding seat in the House. Every 10 years a census is carried
out, and then the state governments go to work and redraw the
congressional districts, purportedly to make them all the same
size. The real reason is of course to keep the other party out of
Congress: the census provides enough information to know where
supporters of the other party live, and the new district boundaries
are drawn so as to segregate all of them in as few districts as
possible. This same game takes place every ten years, and it seems to
outrage no one but me [..].</p>
<p>Even though US politics are located to the right of German politics,
there is a very real sense in which Germany is more conservative. New
technologies and new ways of doing things are embraced much more
enthusiastically in the US. Even conservatives will often propose
quite radical policy changes, such as throwing out the whole income
tax system and replacing it with a national sales tax. On a whim, some
states will introduce gay marriage and others will put a prohibition
against it into the state constitution. Things appear to move much
slower in Germany [..].</p>
<p>This is not the full story however. I am constantly amazed by the poor
quality and backwardedness of many technologies routinely employed in
the US. Sometimes I think that while Germans tend to tolerate
outrageous prices without complaint, Americans tolerate substandard
quality [..]</p>
<p>It's a common stereotype that American TV is unbelievably bad. And for
the most part, it is. You don't get any international news, instead
you see hyped up national and local news, invariably stressing violent
or freak or feel-good incidents; politics is always presented in a
black and white, emotional, and incredibly simplifying manner, then
you have UFOs and "Unsolved Mysteries", and of course a fair amount of
daytime talk shows with transgender prostitutes who recently had
plastic surgery and are now sleeping with their sons, or
whatever. This whole disaster is thankfully interrupted by screaming
commercials every couple of minutes. I can't stomach it for longer
than half an hour [..]</p>
<p>Again, there's another side to the story, which is not well-known
outside of the US, maybe not even inside. It is public TV and
radio. Financed mostly by donations and partly by the government (few
ads), it provides exceptionally high quality programming, much better
than anything I've seen on German public TV. For example, I saw an 8
hour documentary about the war against the native Americans,
stretching out over four days, and a similar one about the civil
rights movement [..]</p>
<p>It turns out that professors in the US are a lot freer than their
German colleagues: for about four months of the year, they can do what
they want, without any obligations of presence whatsoever. While
Germany also has long semester vacations, professors still have to
report to work every day (except for their regular vacation time). On
the other hand, German professors usually have personal secretaries
and post doctorial academic assistants, which most US professors
lack. Professors in Germany are very highly regarded in the public
opinion and accordingly full of themselves [..]</p>
<p>It seems to me that while the average American is much more health
conscious than the average German, the average German is actually
healthier. The first thing every visitor to the US notices is the
immense number of astoundingly obese people. There is a huge obsession
with fat-free foods, to the extent that people happily eat sweet
desserts as long as they are fat-free. Americans seem to be eating
constantly: in the car, at the movie theater, at work, while watching
TV; more often than not, it is fast food or snacks [..]</p>
<p>There is a strange parallel between the relationships Canada/US and
the Netherlands/Germany: the smaller brother looks at the bigger one
and finds fault with much of what he sees, he then desperately tries
to do everything better, succeeds remarkably well, but tragically, his
efforts are completely ignored by the big brother and the rest of the
world -- he is simply too small and unimportant [..]</p>
<p>From the outside, the USA look like a terribly violent and aggressive
country. [..] Somewhat paradoxically, everyday life is a lot less
aggressive in the US than it is in Germany. People are generally more
polite and friendly. Phrases like "please", "thank you", "excuse me"
and "you are welcome" are a lot more common in the US. It happens all
the time that a nice girl that you have never met before smiles at you
for no apparent reason. (In Germany, they do it only if they have a
very good reason, which means that you're in business.) If you wait in
line in an American supermarket, you don't have to constantly watch
out for people who try to cut in in front of you [..] The American
friendliness is fragile however and is mixed with a strange moralistic
streak: if somebody does anything considered morally wrong, the normal
sympathy and empathy is immediately and utterly withdrawn and replaced
by heart-felt condemnation [..]</p>
<p>In Germany, if they see police, people often think something is wrong;
in the U.S., if they see police, people usually feel safe (except for
many blacks who may have had bad experiences with police before).</p>
