<p>When Newton and Leibniz invented Calculus in parallel, they also
invented two different notations for it. Leibniz used dy/dx to
differentiate function y(x), Newton used y'. Although Newton's
notation is more compact, Leibniz's is more expressive (neither is
entirely "correct", but, they worked), and it turned out Leibniz made
the better choice. His notation made further research easier and
possible.</p>
<p>Then, weird things happened; Brits shunned all developments that come
out of the mainland Europe, along with its "funny" notation. Result:
Britain falls behind for decades, according to some, for
centuries. All because of a stupid notation difference, and punk-ass
nationalism.</p>
<p>Does this historical anectode relate to how Britain became the
odd-man-out in Europe recently? Maybe. Maybe it doesnt.. It's like
what-ever. Recent events just made me remember this little anectode,
and I thought I share it. It's my bizzle my nizzle. Fo shizzle.</p>
