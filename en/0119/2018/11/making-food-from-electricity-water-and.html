<h1>Making Food from Electricity, Water and Air - Solarfoods</h1>
<p>A Finnish company called Solar Foods plans next month to start making a kilo of food a day from nothing but electricity, water and air [with plans to scale].</p>
<p>The company will electrolyze water to produce hydrogen that is used, along with carbon dioxide and small amounts of trace elements, to feed microbes.</p>
<p>The microbial cells, with a protein content of up to 60 percent and an amino acid composition similar to soybeans or algae, will be heat-treated to form a fine powder, similar in appearance and texture to dried milk [..]</p>
<p>The company’s €1 million (USD $1.1 million) pilot plant, near the Finnish capital of Helsinki, is intended as a precursor to commercial-scale operations that could commence as early as the beginning of 2021, depending on European Food Authority (EFA) approval. [..]</p>
<p>If it gets approval, Solar Foods will make an investment decision on commercial production and could move to large-scale manufacturing, producing protein for 50 million meals a year, within 12 months. “We are already able to scale,” Vainikka said.</p>
<p>A full-scale plant would resemble a brewery, he said. Unlike a brewery, though, the microorganisms vital to the production process would feed off hydrogen and carbon dioxide instead of sugars from plant material.</p>
<p>“This is a fundamental difference compared to any of the foods on the market, or technologies or ways to produce food,” said Vainikka. “This way, we can disconnect from land use completely.”</p>
<hr />
<p>They are also "teaming up with the European Space Agency to create a bioreactor that can make food on Mars".</p>
