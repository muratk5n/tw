<h1>Yo Bitch</h1>

<p>Twitter’s trust and safety group, responsible for safeguarding users,
was run by Del Harvey, Twitter employee No. 25. [..] Her lack of
traditional technical and policy experience made her a polarizing
figure within the organization, although allies have found her passion
about safety issues inspiring. In the early days, “she personally
responded to individual [affected] users–Del worked tirelessly,” says
Macgillivray. “[She] took on some of the most complex issues that
Twitter faced. We didn’t get everything right, but Del’s leadership
was very often a factor when we did.”</p>
<p>Harvey’s view, championed by Macgillivray and other executives, was
that bad speech could ultimately be defeated with more speech, a
belief that echoed Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’s 1927
landmark First Amendment decision that this remedy is always
preferable to “enforced silence.” Harvey occasionally used as an
example the phrase “Yo bitch,” which bad actors intend as invective,
but others perceive as a sassy hello. Who was Twitter to decide? The
marketplace of ideas would figure it out [..].</p>
<p>“I often hear people in Silicon Valley talking about fake news and
disinformation as problems we can engineer our way out of,” says
Brendan Nyhan, codirector of Bright Line Watch, a group that monitors
threats to democratic processes. “That’s wrong. People are looking for
a solution that doesn’t exist.”</p>
