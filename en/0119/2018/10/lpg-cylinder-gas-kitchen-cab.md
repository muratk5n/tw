# LPG Cylinders, Energy, Taxis, Kitchens

It is possible to heat, power a house using portable LPG
cylinders. Such things are common in many kitchens in various
countries. Completely off-grid, cheap.

India, TR.. never saw in US, or DE, the image above was from an AU
site, cld be prevalent there

Standard cylinder < 15 dollars. Call a number, have one delivered at
home, like ordering pizza. These gas companies have
[stores](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eur2kgXXUAI9Yoy?format=jpg&name=small),
everywhere, they have those canisters stacked up, ppl see them passing
by. Even some taxi cabs converted to run on this thing..

One delivery company, Aygaz, [sold](https://www.aygaz.com.tr/uploads/yatirimci-iliskileri/yatirimci-sunumlari/25a0abbc_45db_4a83_a0d7_f495d521cfa9__aygaz-ir-presentation_february-2020.pdf)
25 million standard cylinder worth of this stuff in 2019.

Empty cylinders get refilled in a [plant](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuvTpEwWgAAh9ac?format=jpg&name=small).
Call the same number, cylinder gets picked up. Like reverse-delivery of pizza

They pack a punch (molecules better than electrons). Ex, standard size
12 kg, keg size cylinder based stove in kitchen, it can go for
years with medium to low usage.

Let's verify. High-heat flame energy from an all-electric, single
heater stove is 1500 Watts, which is 1/3 efficient [1] compared to gas,
standard LPG cylinder = 12 kg LPG, LPG is 46-51 MJ/kg, 1 MJ = 277 Watt
hour

```python
print ('%0.2f h' % (46*12*277.7/(1500/3)))
```

```text
306.58 h
```

This rings true, if you left stove on at high heat, it can
continuously run for >300 hours, have it on 1 hr a day, lasts a year.

Think about how much energy that is, at such a cheap price.

Imagine using that energy to heat up a house, power all electronic items.

Annual energy required for typical house heating is 8,208 kWh,
electricity for all other items 3,700 kWh.

```python
energy_req = 8208 + 3700
cylinder = (4*16*46*277)/1000.
print (energy_req / cylinder)
```

Every month, you get 4 of those cylinders (little bigger 16 kg size),
you'd be fine.

And just saw there are 45 kg versions

LPG is fossil of course. But same tech could be extended to renewable
gases, fuels. Portable cylinders could appeal to low end,
off-grid. For high end, on-grid, pipelines are still way to go... Or
in bulk, renewables are used on generator turbines to generate
electricity.
