<h1>Global E-mail Patterns Reveal “Clash of Civilizations”..</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/512116/global-e-mail-patterns-reveal-clash-of-civilizations/">Link</a></p>
<p>In 1992 [..]  Samuel Huntington suggested that future conflicts would
be driven largely by cultural differences. He went on to map out a new
world order in which the people of the world are divided into nine
culturally distinct civilisations. These include: Western
civilisation; Latin American civilisation; the Orthodox world of
former Soviet Union countries; the Sinic civilisation including China,
the Koreas and Vietnam; the Muslim world of the greater Middle East;
Sub-Saharan Africa and so on [..].</p>
<p>[Researchers] have analysed a global database of e-mail messages, and
their locations, sent by  more than 10 million people over the space
of a year. State and co say that the pattern of connections between
these people, clearly reflects the civilisations mapped out by
Huntington. In other words, the way we send e-mails is a reflection of
the mesh of civilisations that is an important driver of future
conflict [..]. The researchers then counted the instances in which
users swapped messages with each other, considering this to be
evidence of a tie between the countries where these users were
located. This gave them a simple count of the number of ties between
pairs of countries around the world</p>
