# Taking Back the Internet

Government and industry have betrayed the internet, and us.

By subverting the internet at every level to make it a vast,
multi-layered and robust surveillance platform, the NSA has undermined
a fundamental social contract. The companies that build and manage our
internet infrastructure, the companies that create and sell us our
hardware and software, or the companies that host our data: we can no
longer trust them to be ethical internet stewards.

This is not the internet the world needs, or the internet its creators
envisioned. We need to take it back. And by we, I mean the engineering
community. Yes, this is primarily a political problem, a policy matter
that requires political intervention. But this is also an engineering
problem, and there are several things engineers can – and should – do.

One, we should expose. If you do not have a security clearance, and if
you have not received a National Security Letter, you are not bound by
a federal confidentially requirements or a gag order. If you have been
contacted by the NSA to subvert a product or protocol, you need to
come forward with your story. Your employer obligations don't cover
illegal or unethical activity. If you work with classified data and
are truly brave, expose what you know. We need whistleblowers.

We need to know how exactly how the NSA and other agencies are
subverting routers, switches, the internet backbone, encryption
technologies and cloud systems. I already have five stories from
people like you, and I've just started collecting. I want 50. There's
safety in numbers, and this form of civil disobedience is the moral
thing to do.
