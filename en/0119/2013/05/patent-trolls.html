<h1>Patent Trolls</h1>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble alone has been sued by “non practicing entities”—a/k/a
patent trolls—well over twenty-five times and received an additional
twenty-plus patent claims in the last five years. The claimants do not
have products and are not competitors. They assert claims for the sole
purpose of extorting money.  Companies like Barnes &amp; Noble have to
choose between paying extortionate ransoms and settling the claim, or
fighting in a judicial system ill equipped to handle baseless patent
claims at costs that frequently reach millions of dollars [..].</p>
<p>Something must change. Common sense and the elimination of this blight
on the economy are not the only reasons why. There is also a
constitutional basis. The Patent and Copyright Clause grants Congress
the power “[t]o...promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,”
not science fiction and litigious arts. (Article 1, Section 8, Clause
8 (emphasis added)). But the current system allows trolls to pursue
fantastic allegations—claims that would be laughed out of the room in
actual scientific or technical circles—in endless litigation that
taxes and taxes true innovators while making no meaningful
contribution to society [..].</p>
<p>Even the most plainly baseless lawsuits are expensive and can take
years to defeat. In at least four cases, Barnes &amp; Noble has faced
litigation by patentees asserting the same theories on which they
previously lost. In one case, for example, Barnes &amp; Noble is alleged
to infringe patents because BN.com uses the HTML language and returns
search results other than exact matches. The patentee asserted these
allegations against Barnes &amp; Noble despite having tried and lost a
case against other ecommerce retailers based on the same functional
allegations levied against their websites. In two of these four cases,
the patentees ceased pursuing claims against Barnes &amp; Noble once the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed their
earlier losses. But in two others, the appeals are not yet final and
although Barnes &amp; Noble has filed dispositive motions, the litigations
have carried on actively for years.</p>
