<h1>Conservative Artisan</h1>
<p>Is it possible for an Artisan, particularly an STP to be conservative?
This sounds plausible. We said that Ti can conceptualize, but, at the
same time, Se can force STPs to take "the current state of things" as
granted, Ti having to work through in-the-moment Se was a major cause
for this, etc. But what are the mechanics?</p>
<p>IMO, it is useful to think of STPs as the hunter / sports type, say
chasing a pray in the woods.</p>
<p>This person needs to move fast. Then, conceptual determinations
projected to physical world are colored with "what is immovable", and
"what I can run over". This semi-conceptual framework is needed to be
able to quickly make tactical decisions while moving fast. A big rock,
a big tree is immovable - you have to run around them. In comparison,
a fig leaf is weak, you just run over it.</p>
<p>If no constant sensor data is available, then you seek immovables, but
still some form of pysical presence is preferred. A famous person XYZ
(big man) can be such immovable, or "groups" of physical
peoples. After all these are things you can see. In the absence of
that, other perceived unchanging "things" can become immovables, such
as an important state (a superpower XYZ "so big, so important!"), or
more interestingly, history itself (it's always been there!). If
historic artifacts are visible all around, this could, in theory,
could increase its effect.</p>
<p>This is how we make sense an Artisan writer, or politician combating
with various things around him. Sticking to history, to a defunct
system is due to its perceived "unchanging" status can be expected,
ditto for cozying up (or simply expecting they will always exist) to
various powers because they are just "there". Meanwhile characters
loom large, some of who are immovable solids, others, such as a
journalist, can be a fig leaf, a thing you can simply run over. The
fact that this journalist could be part of a process, a continuation
of something logical, and normal, perhaps part of a slow trend whose
bashing can cause backlash can completely be missed by an STP.</p>
<p>Like I said, these are all pshychological preferences, nothing
biological, and certainly not categorically good or bad. Some
preferences are excellent at certain things, and not on others. This
is all fine. That's why diversity is important.</p>
