# Doner is Not Invented in Berlin or Europe

What is this urban legend about Berlin being the birthplace of
*döner*? This is simply not true. I could not believe my ears when I
heard of this.. One article admits "[a] club-shaped piece of meat cut
by hand from a vertically turning spit goes back more than 100 years
in Turkey". People in TR believe the birthplace as the city of Bursa,
and the exact year is claimed to be [1867](http://iskender.com.tr/iskenderin-tarihi.html).

But then again, there is some localist, nationalist fairy tale
associated with that too, doner goes back further. *Döner* (meaning
'it turns'), Greek *gyro*, Arabic *shawarma*, or Armenian *tarna*
(literally means to turn) are all variations of the same idea that
were served all over the place in Eastern Europe and Middle East, for
a long time.

Serving it as fast food might have been the invention here in Berlin,
or maybe Berlin was the first major European city to serve the dish in
franchises. Who knows. Someone needs to set the record straight.
The crux of doner is the meat that turns, cooked a certain way, sliced
a certain way. None of that is invented in Europe.
