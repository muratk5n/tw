# Research and Industry

In general, research is about expanding the breadth of human
knowledge, and there is rarely an end-point or measurable outcome.
Furthermore, science itself needs to be reactive and adaptive because
researchers around the globe are constantly making discoveries.

This is not something I fully appreciated when I entered academia, and
I found the fast pace with which new projects were undertaken, and
their scope, to be staggering. New projects tend to be all about
excitement, diversity and innovative ideas. However, many projects do
not actually get started, others change beyond all recognition as the
science underpinning them evolves and some last only until the first
publication. This means that there is often little consideration for
the feasibility of a task or the available resources.

This lack of certainty (and in many cases, lack of management
structure) means that coordination is wanting and inefficiency is
rife. It is generally expected that groups of people will
spontaneously organize themselves around ideas without any formal
mandate or structure—a style some have called 'managing from
below'. This can be entirely frustrating, but attempts to change it
are futile.

For example, once I had arrived at the institute, I found I was able
to manage multiple ill-defined projects with ever-changing priorities
and goals while avoiding bottlenecks—a useful skill. But I also tried
to quell the chaos by introducing formal project management and
process, and in this I failed miserably. I could not demonstrate the
usefulness of structure and strict planning for the short-focused,
siloed projects that typify research, and I realized that any
management practice that introduces a burden to research will stifle
creativity and be met with hostility [..].

After moving to academia, I was surprised to find that the principal
investigator (PI) has nearly unlimited authority. As in any monarchy,
problems arise if the leader is not benevolent, experienced and well
adjusted. Academia is full of horror stories of PIs hiding under their
desks and refusing to come out, flying into rages if other researchers
dare take public holidays or rebuking random individuals because they
cannot find the person they really wish to yell at—these tales are all
true [..].

[B]ut I have few regrets about moving back into academia. Looking
back, I realize it took me a good two years to adjust and slip back
into the academic way of doing things. Over that period, I grew a
thicker skin to cope with the complex personalities and wayward
attitudes I encounter in academia—today, any bizarre rudeness just
amuses me. My job gives me the freedom to explore new ideas and the
chance to score grants to fuel the research. I work with passionate
and creative people, and the flexibility in my schedule allows me to
see more of my children.

Of course, the largest benefit will always be the work itself—it has
been all I wanted it to be. In one frantic month, I was tasked with
mapping thousands of cancer genomes to look for common variants,
investigating global health issues from five geographically distinct
laboratories and analyzing five years of mass spectrometry experiments
to look for disease-related biomarkers.  I have been given the
opportunity to try my hand at nearly anything, and I am able to reach
out to experts to provide assistance. The challenges that academics
face are enormous and the resources meager, but there is unbridled
enthusiasm to explore the problems and a willingness to try different
approaches. For me no other job (and I have had more than a few) has
the same level of personal reward.
