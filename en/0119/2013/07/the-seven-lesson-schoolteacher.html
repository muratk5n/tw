<h1>The Seven Lesson Schoolteacher</h1>
<p>Call me Mr. Gatto, please. Twenty-six years ago, having nothing better
to do at the time, I tried my hand at schoolteaching. The license I
hold certifies that I am an instructor of English language and English
literature, but that isn't what I do at all. I don't teach English, I
teach school -- and I win awards doing it.</p>
<p>Teaching means different things in different places, but seven lessons
are universally taught from Harlem to Hollywood Hills [..]</p>
<ol>
<li>CONFUSION: [..] The first lesson I teach is confusion. Everything I
teach is out of context. I teach the un-relating of everything. I
teach disconnections. I teach too much: the orbiting of planets, the
law of large numbers, slavery, adjectives [..] What do any of these
things have to do with each other? [..]</li>
</ol>
<p>The logic of the school-mind is that it is better to leave school with
a tool kit of superficial jargon derived from economics, sociology,
natural science and so on than to leave with one genuine enthusiasm.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CLASS POSITION: The second lesson I teach is class position. I
teach that students must stay in the class where they belong. I don't
know who decides my kids belong there but that's not my business. The
children are numbered so that if any get away they can be returned to
the right class [..]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INDIFFERENCE: The third lesson I teach kids is indifference. I
teach children not to care about anything too much, even though they
want to make it appear that they do. How I do this is very subtle. I
do it by demanding that they become totally involved in my lessons,
jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation, competing
vigorously with each other for my favor. It's heartwarming when they
do that; it impresses everyone, even me. When I'm at my best I plan
lessons very carefully in order to produce this show of
enthusiasm. But when the bell rings I insist that they stop whatever
it is that we've been working on and proceed quickly to the next work
station. They must turn on and off like a light switch. [..]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCY: The fourth lesson I teach is emotional
dependency. By stars and red checks, smiles and frowns, prizes, honors
and disgraces I teach kids to surrender their will to the predestined
chain of command [..]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INTELLECTUAL DEPENDENCY: The fifth lesson I teach is intellectual 
dependency. Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do. It
is the most important lesson, that we must wait for other people,
better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives. The
expert makes all the important choices; only I, the teacher, can
determine what you must study, or rather, only the people who pay me
can make those decisions which I then enforce [..] Successful children
do the thinking I appoint them with a minimum of resistance and a
decent show of enthusiasm [..]. Good people wait for an expert to tell
them what to do. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that our entire
economy depends upon this lesson being learned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PROVISIONAL SELF-ESTEEM: [..Y]ou know how impossible it is to make
self-confident spirits conform. Our world wouldn't survive a flood of
confident people very long, so I teach that your self-respect should
depend on expert opinion. My kids are constantly evaluated and
judged. A monthly report, impressive in its provision, is sent into
students' homes to signal approval or to mark exactly, down to a
single percentage point, how dissatisfied with their children parents
should be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ONE CAN'T HIDE: The seventh lesson I teach is that one can't
hide. I teach children they are always watched, that each is under
constant surveillance by myself and my colleagues. There are no
private spaces for children, there is no private time [..].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The current debate about whether we should have a national curriculum
is phony. We already have a national curriculum locked up in the seven
lessons I  have just outlined. Such a curriculum produces physical,
moral, and intellectual paralysis, and no curriculum of content will
be sufficient to reverse its hideous effects. What is currently under
discussion in our national school hysteria about failing academic
performance misses the point. Schools teach exactly what they are
intended to teach and they do it well: how to be a good Egyptian and
remain in your place in the pyramid.</p>
