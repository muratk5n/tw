# Strength and a Weakness

The End of Economic Man [another Drucker book] was perhaps least
fashionable for its time in its respect for religion and in the
attention it paid to the Christian churches. Insofar as contemporary
political analysis paid attention at all, it considered religion an
outmoded relic and the churches ineffectual reactionaries. Stalin’s
famous outburst: “How many divisions has the Pope?” shocked only the
way a four-letter word shocks in the Victorian drawing room; it said
bluntly what most people knew very well but covered up by polite
circumlocution.    My book, however, has a chapter, “The Failure of
the Christian Churches,” which argues that the churches could have
been expected to succeed, could have been expected to provide the new
foundation. In this chapter, the Christian churches are seen as the
one potential counterforce and the one available political
sanctuary. The contemporaries, thirty years ago, still children of
[..] nineteenth-century anti-clericalism, tended to ignore the
Christian dissenters—from Kierkegaard to the worker-priests of
France—as isolated romantics, hopelessly out of touch with
reality. The End of Economic Man was, to my knowledge, the first book
that perceived them the way we tend to perceive them now, that is, as
hard-headed realists addressing themselves to the true problems of
modern society. This enabled the book to foreshadow both the emergence
of Christian-Democratic parties that have been so prominent a feature
of post-war Europe, and the “aggiornamento” of the Catholic Church
under Pope John.

But The End of Economic Man also reached the conclusion that the
churches could not, after all, furnish the basis for European society
and European politics. They had to fail, though not for the reasons
for which the contemporaries tended to ignore them. Religion could
indeed offer an answer to the despair of the individual and to his
existential agony. But it could not offer an answer to the despair of
the masses. I am afraid that this conclusion still holds
today. Western Man—indeed today Man altogether—is not ready to
renounce this world. Indeed he still looks for secular salvation, if
he expects salvation at all. Churches, especially Christian churches,
can (and should) preach a “social gospel.” But they cannot (and should
not) substitute politics for Grace, and social science for
Redemption. Religion, the critic of any society, cannot accept any
society or even any social program, without abandoning its true
Kingdom, that of a Soul alone with its God. Therein lies both the
strength of the churches as the conscience of society and their
incurable weakness as political and social forces in society.
