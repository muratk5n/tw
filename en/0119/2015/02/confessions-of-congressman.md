# Confessions of a Congressman

I am a member of Congress [..] It's a frustrating, even disillusioning
job. The public pretty much hates us [..They] know something is
wrong. But they often don't know exactly what is wrong. And sometimes,
the things they think will fix Congress — like making us come home
every weekend — actually break it further.  So here are some things I
wish the voters knew about the people elected to represent them.

1) Congress is not out of touch with folks back home

Congress is only a part-time job in Washington, DC. An hour after the
last vote, almost everyone is on the airplane home. Congress votes
fewer than 100 days a year, spending the rest of the time back home
where we pander to their constituents' short-term interests, not the
long-term good of the nation. Anyone who is closer to your district
than you are will replace you. Incumbents stick to their districts
like Velcro.

2) Congress listens best to money

It is more lucrative to pander to big donors than to regular
citizens. Campaigns are so expensive that the average member needs a
million-dollar war chest every two years and spends 50 percent to 75
percent of their term in office raising money. Think about
that. You're paying us to do a job, and we're spending that time
you're paying us asking rich people and corporations to give us money
so we can run ads convincing you to keep paying us to do this job. Now
that the Supreme Court has ruled that money is speech and corporations
are people, the mega-rich have been handed free loudspeakers. Their
voices, even out-of-state voices, are drowning out the desperate
whispers of ordinary Americans.

3) Almost everyone in Congress loves gerrymandering

Without crooked districts, most members of Congress probably would not
have been elected. According to the Cook Political Report, only about
90 of the 435 seats in Congress are "swing" seats that can be won by
either political party. In other words, 345 seats are safe Republican
or Democratic seats. Both parties like it that way. So that's what
elections are like today: rather than the voters choosing us, we
choose the voters. The only threat a lot of us incumbents face is in
the primaries, where someone even more extreme than we are can turn
out the vote among an even smaller, more self-selected group of
partisans.

4) You have no secret ballot anymore

The only way political parties can successfully gerrymander is by
knowing how you vote. Both parties have destroyed your privacy at the
polling booth. Thanks to election rolls, we don't know exactly whom
you voted for, but we get pretty damn close. We know exactly which
primaries and general elections you have voted in, and since there are
so few realistic candidates in most elections, down or up ballot, we
might as well know exactly who you voted for. Marry that data with
magazine subscriptions, the kind of car you drive, and all sorts of
other easily available consumer information that we've figured out how
to use to map your political preferences, and we can gerrymander and
target subdivisions, houses — even double beds. Republicans want the
male vote; Democrats the female vote.

5) We don't have a Congress but a parliament

Over the last several decades, party loyalty has increased to
near-unanimity. If a member of Congress doesn't vote with his or her
party 99 percent of the time, he's considered unreliable and excluded
from party decision-making. Gone are the days when you were expected
to vote your conscience and your district, the true job of a
congressperson. Parliaments only work because they have a prime
minister who can get things done. We have a parliament without any
ability to take executive action. We should not be surprised we are
gridlocked.

6) Congressional committees are a waste of time

With parliamentary voting, control is centralized in each party's
leadership. Almost every major decision is made by the Speaker or
Minority Leader, not by committees. They feel it is vital to party
success to have a national "message" that is usually poll-driven, not
substantive. So why develop any expertise as a committee member if
your decisions will only be overridden by party leadership? Why try to
get on a good committee if you have already ceded authority to your
unelected, unaccountable party leaders? The result is members
routinely don't show up at committee hearings, or if they do show up,
it's only to ask a few questions and leave. A lot of members fight for
committees that will help them raise money or get a sweet lobbying job
later (more on that in a minute). The result is that the engine for
informed lawmaking is broken.

7) Congress is a stepping-stone to lobbying

Congress is no longer a destination but a journey. Committee
assignments are mainly valuable as part of the interview process for a
far more lucrative job as a K Street lobbyist. You are considered
naïve if you are not currying favor with wealthy corporations under
your jurisdiction. It's become routine to see members of Congress drop
their seat in Congress like a hot rock when a particularly lush
vacancy opens up. The revolving door is spinning every day. Special
interests deplete Congress of its best talent.

8)The best people don't run for Congress

Smart people figured this out years ago and decided to pursue careers
other than running for Congress. The thought of living in a fishbowl
with 30-second attack ads has made Congress repulsive to spouses and
families. The idea of spending half your life begging rich people you
don't know for money turns off all reasonable, self-respecting
people. That, plus lower pay than a first-year graduate of a top law
school, means that Congress, like most federal agencies, is not
attracting the best and the brightest in America.
