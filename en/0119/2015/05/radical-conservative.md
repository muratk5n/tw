# Radical Conservative

Tim Harford

[O]n the off chance that we ever see an economically radical Tory
party, what policies might I suggest they embrace?

Step one is to replace the benefit system with a more libertarian form
of redistribution. Scrap all the mainstream benefit payments — for
example, child benefit, jobseeker’s allowance, housing benefit, winter
fuel allowance and even the state pension. Scrap the income tax
allowance too. Give all long-term UK residents a taxable basic income
of £8,000 a year and charge a flat 40 per cent income tax rate on
every penny. The basic income can be phased in on a residency basis
over 10 years, ensuring that recent immigrants pay a larger net
contribution to the exchequer.

This policy targets poverty rather than inequality. It abolishes much
of the bureaucracy that surrounds benefit eligibility, promotes
individual responsibility and reduces the stigma of collecting money
from the state. It gives everyone, rich and poor, a clear incentive to
work. Compared to the current system, it redistributes to the working
poor and to the highest earners — both groups of people who are likely
to produce more taxable income in response. It is simple, discouraging
tax avoidance. And, despite the flat headline rate, the average income
tax contribution is progressive: negative for those on low incomes,
10-25 per cent for those on average incomes and approaching 40 per
cent for the rich [..]

A second policy is to privatise the entire school system. Children
would receive a £10,000 basic income in a tax-sheltered educational
account controlled by parents but usable only for childcare, school or
university fees. Compulsory schooling would end at the age of 14 and
educational institutions would be competing to attract these pots of
tax-free cash with engaging and practical training courses. Any
unspent money would be taxed and handed over to the child at the age
of 21.

Third, scrap the personal pension system. Both the logic for and the
reputation of the existing system is in tatters. With the new flat tax
and universal basic income it would also be superfluous. People can
save for their retirement in more flexible Isa-style savings accounts
and could be nudged into doing so by a default payroll deduction [..].

A final idea: look to broaden the tax base and lower tax
rates. Abolishing all VAT exemptions would be a good start, and would
provide substantial revenue. A carbon tax would also be well worth
introducing, as would more proportionate taxation of housing
wealth. The proceeds of these taxes would be needed at first to pay
for the universal basic income but the aim would be to reduce
universal income tax rate too. A future leftwing government could
redistribute within the same framework by increasing the basic income.

That should do the trick for the first term but a Conservative
government should also commit to staying in the European Union, which
stands in favour of trade, business and hard money; and to leaving the
National Health Service alone for a few years just to see how it
performs when not being incessantly prodded by politicians.

There you have it: a smaller, less bureaucratic state, innovation in
education, redistribution to the poorest, a lower but more transparent
income tax to attract the rich, an economic boom on the back of
much-needed home-building and affordable housing for all.

Conservative Central Office can thank me later.
