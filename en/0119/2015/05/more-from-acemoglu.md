Daron Acemoglu, *Why Countries Fail*

Yes, countries such as Syria and Egypt are poor, and their populations
are primarily Muslim. But these countries also systemically differ in
other ways that are far more important for prosperity. For one, they
were all provinces of the Ottoman Empire, which heavily, and
adversely, shaped the way they developed. After Ottoman rule
collapsed, the Middle East was absorbed into the English and French
colonial empires, which, again, stunted their possibilities. After
independence, they followed much of the former colonial world by
developing hierarchical, authoritarian political regimes with few of
the political and economic institutions that, we will argue, are
crucial for generating economic success. This development path was
forged largely by the history of Ottoman and European rule. The
relationship between the Islamic religion and poverty in the Middle
East is largely spurious. [..]

Geography is also unlikely to explain the poverty of the Middle East
for similar reasons. After all, the Middle East led the world in the
Neolithic Revolution, and the first towns developed in modern
Iraq. Iron was first smelted in Turkey, and as late as the Middle Ages
the Middle East was technologically dynamic. [.. The reason for the
backwardness] was the expansion and consolidation of the Ottoman
Empire, and it is the institutional legacy of this empire that keeps
the Middle East poor today [..].

The Ottoman state was absolutist, with the sultan accountable to few
and sharing power with none. The economic institutions the Ottomans
imposed were highly extractive. There was no private property in land,
which all formally belonged to the state. Taxation of land and
agricultural output, together with loot from war, was the main source
of government revenues.

[Plus] the Ottoman state did not dominate the Middle East in the same
way that it could dominate its heartland in Anatolia or even to the
extent that the Spanish state dominated Latin American society [..] It
lacked not only the ability to impose a stable order in much of the
Middle East but also the administrative capacity to collect taxes
[this is the worst mixture of governance and non-governance]. So it
“farmed” them out to individuals, selling off the right to others to
collect taxes in whatever way they could. These tax farmers became
autonomous and powerful. Rates of taxation in the Middle Eastern
territories were very high, varying between one-half or two-thirds of
what farmers produced. Much of this revenue was kept by the tax
farmers [..] In Palestine, for example, the situation was so dire that
starting in the late sixteenth century, peasants left the most fertile
land and moved up to mountainous areas [..].

Extractive economic institutions in the urban areas of the Ottoman
Empire were no less stifling. Commerce was under state control, and
occupations were strictly regulated by guilds and monopolies. The
consequence was that at the time of the Industrial Revolution the
economic institutions of the Middle East were extractive. The region
stagnated economically.

I call on anyone who can think to not to refrain from commentary such
as this just because it doesn't fit some sort of "cultural acceptance"
that is mostly the product of a feel-good globalization mantra during
the 90s. In this era, which was extremely bereft of original thinking
outside of tech, national / cultural differences, of any kind, became
a sort of "cool thing to talk about"; "I... AM... KLINGOOOOON!" used
to scream the man every other episode in the most famous scifi show of
the day which personified everything that was wrong with the cultural
interaction at this time. "Ohh part X of your history / culture is
different -barbaric- weird... how cool!". It was the lowest hanging
fruit, perhaps, for all races, ethnicities, religions in US and the
world could protect itself under a charade of funkiness. A certain
[visible] part of your culture is different, be loud and proud about
it (and tell something cool about it to us so we pass the word to our
friends and also be cool in the process). "Oleg means donkey fart
after a meal had with wine".. Wow! Dude! Tell me more! "My name Barack
means _the one_ in Swahili (actually it doesn't, it just means
"aplenty". Of what, who knows). Bunch of weird shit like this.

But most of history and culture for most of the world, sucked, as
described above. Nothing in the past is better than today. Europe, US,
Middle East all had ups and downs (mostly downs for ME
recently). People should come to terms with this.
