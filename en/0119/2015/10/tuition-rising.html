<h1>Tuition Rising</h1>
<p>Ronald Ehrenberg </p>
<p>The real earnings of workers increase as their productivity levels
increase. During the period [of a study], because of changes in
technology and increased use of capital equipment, the productivity
and hence the real earnings of Americans rose by about 2.5 percent a
year. However, the productivity of faculty at these selective private
institutions, as measured by the number of students that they educated
each year, did not change very much, primarily because low
student-faculty ratios were felt to be essential to high-quality
college education. As a result, these institutions did not receive
extra revenue each year from gains in faculty members’ productivity,
which in turn could then be distributed back to the faculty in the
form of salary increases.</p>
<p>The institutions thus faced a choice. On the one hand, they could
allow faculty salaries to decline relative to salaries of individuals
in other professions. On the other hand, they could raise tuition
sufficiently to provide faculty salary increases in line with the
raises other employees in the economy were receiving. The former
strategy would make it difficult to attract and retain high-quality
faculty, so invariably the latter strategy was pursued.</p>
