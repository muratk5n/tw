# Economics of Abundance

Jeremy Rifkin, The Zero Marginal Cost Society

The prospect of [people] financing the generation of their own green
energy and overseeing its use and distribution with their own wireless
devices at near zero marginal cost has come a step closer to reality
with the recent recommendation of free Wi-Fi for everyone. In February
2013, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the oversight body
that regulates the U.S. [telecom] industry, dropped a bombshell. The
commission published a proposal that would create “super Wi-Fi
networks” across America, making wireless connection free for
everyone. The FCC plan is to require television stations and other
broadcasters to sell back to the government unused airwaves so they
can be reemployed for public Wi-Fi networks. The reused broadcast
frequencies would have a reach of a mile or more, be able to penetrate
walls and enclosures, and allow users to make free calls from their
mobile phones on the Internet, as well as use the Wi-Fi connection in
their homes and businesses for free, slashing the cost of Internet
bills.

The harnessing of near zero marginal cost communications to manage
near zero marginal cost renewable energy gives society the critical
operating platform to [..] change the economic paradigm. The
controversial FCC proposal has pitted the wireless carriers of the
nation’s great telecommunications companies, including AT&T, T-Mobile,
Intel, and Verizon, against the equally formidable Internet and IT
companies like Google and Microsoft. The former, which have paid out
billions of dollars to secure FCC spectrum licenses, risk heavy losses
to their $178 billion wireless industry. [..] Google is already
providing free Wi-Fi in the Chelsea section of Manhattan and in some
neighborhoods in Silicon Valley.

Industry analysts are predicting that free Wi-Fi “could replace
carrier service.” The FCC is of a like mind. One FCC official says,
“We want our policy to be more end-user-centric and not
carrier-centric.

The FCC proposal comes as a result of dramatic technological advances
over the past decade that have transformed the electromagnetic
spectrum from a scarce resource to a potentially infinitely available
one, just like solar, wind, and geothermal heat [..] The spectrum
itself was viewed as a scarce resource and therefore regarded as a
valuable commercial asset.

Today, new technologies for managing communications over the radio
frequencies have made the concept of the spectrum as a scarce resource
null and void. That new reality is changing the very nature of
broadcast communications. Smart antennas, dynamic spectrum access,
cognitive radio technologies, and mesh networks are among the new
technologies that are expanding the spectrum to an abundant resource
by using it more efficiently and with greater agility [..]

Many industry observers say that the new technologies are going to
make the airwaves “so abundant that there would be no justification
for the government to ration access to spectrum or to give some
services priority over others.” In the near future, everyone will be
able to share Earth’s abundant free air waves, communicating with each
other for nearly free, just as we will share the abundant free energy
of the sun, wind, and geothermal heat [..].

The use of open wireless connections over a free Wi-Fi network is
likely going to become the norm in the years to come, not only in
America, but virtually everywhere. It’s just too beneficial for the
human race to turn down, regardless of the push back by conventional
wired carriers. The notion of communicating over proprietary,
centralized, wired communications networks is going to be little more
than a historical curiosity to young people living in the
mid-twenty-first century.

We are waking up to a new reality that is difficult to fathom. We have
been so convinced of the economics of scarcity that we can hardly
believe that an economy of abundance is possible. But it is. New
communications technologies are turning the broadcast spectrum from a
scarce resource to an abundant one, just as with information,
renewable energy, 3D printing, and online college courses. The journey
to an economy of abundance, however, is cluttered with roadblocks that
could delay and even derail the collaborative era. The challenge is
finding a governance model that can take society into the new
paradigm.

Yes, please a-please let's replace the carrier services... These
people are engaged in grandt-theft of people's money simply making use
of their entrenched position in infrastructure that is stuck in a
limbo, in no small part due to their existence. Free Wifi in cities
would fix a lot of problems.
