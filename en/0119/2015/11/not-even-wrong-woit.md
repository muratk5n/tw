# Not Even Wrong

Woit, 2007

The story of how the discovery of the principles of special relativity
and quantum mechanics revolutionised twentieth-century physics is by
now a rather old one. By 1973, physicists had in place what was to
become a fantastically successful theory of fundamental particles and
their interactions, a theory that was soon to acquire the name of the
'standard model'. Since that time, the overwhelming triumph of the
standard model has been matched by a similarly overwhelming failure to
find any way to make further progress on fundamental questions [..]

### Supersymmetry

Since physicists continue to take seriously the idea of a
supersymmetric extension of the standard model, they must have a
reason to believe that it may be possible to overcome the severe
difficulties explained in detail in the last section. The most popular
hope of this kind is that superstring theory will do the trick. This
hope has motivated an unprecedented quantity of work by a very large
number of the most prominent theoretical physicists for more than
twenty years, but after all this time and effort the whole project
remains nothing more than a hope. Not a single experimental prediction
has been made, nor are there any prospects for this situation to
change soon...

[One] argument often made for supersymmetry is that it is possible
that the low energy limit of a superstring theory is a supersymmetric
quantum field theory. This argument is of course based on the
assumption that at high energies the world is governed by a
super-string theory. The next section will consider the arguments for
that possibility, but one thing to keep in mind is that one of the
main arguments often given for superstring theory is that it explains
super-symmetry. These arguments are circular, and should best be
interpreted as an argument that the fates of supersymmetry and string
theory are linked, that these ideas are either both wrong or both
right.

### Feynman

The lack of any predictions of the theory makes many physicists very
dubious that the idea is correct. One prominent theorist who felt this
way up until his death in 1988 was Richard Feynman, who was quoted in
an interview in 1987 as follows:

"Now I know that other old men have been very foolish in saying things
like this, and, therefore, I would be very foolish to say this is
nonsense. I am going to be very foolish, because I do feel strongly
that this is nonsense! I can't help it, even though I know the danger
in such a point of view. So perhaps I could entertain future
historians by saying I think all this superstring stuff is crazy and
is in the wrong direction".

[To the question, "what is it you don't like about it?" he answers:]

"I don't like that they're not calculating anything. I don't like that
they don't check their ideas. I don't like that for anything that
disagrees with an experiment, they cook up an explanation - a fix-up
to say "Well, it still might be true". For example, the theory
requires ten dimensions. Well, maybe there's a way of wrapping up six
of the dimensions. Yes, that's possible mathematically, but why not
seven? When they write their equation, the equation should decide how
many of these things get wrapped up, not the desire to agree with
experiment. In other words, there's no reason whatsoever in
superstring theory that it isn't eight of the ten dimensions that get
wrapped up and that the result is only two dimensions, which would be
completely in disagreement with experience. So the fact that it might
disagree with experience is very tenuous, it doesn't produce anything;
it has to be excused most of the time. It doesn't look right".

A more concise quote I have heard attributed to Feynman on this topic
was: 'String theorists don't make predictions, they make excuses.
