<h1>Biotech Eating Jobs</h1>
<p>Jeremy Rifkin, 1995</p>
<p>Scientists are just beginning to explore the great potential of
tissue-culture production in the laboratory. Researchers have
successfully grown orange and lemon vesicles from tissue culture, and
some industry analysts believe that the day is not far off when orange
juice will be grown in vats, eliminating the need for planting orange
groves.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers at the Department of Agriculture "tricked" loose
cotton cells into growing by immersing them in a vat of
nutrients. Because the cotton is grown under sterile conditions, free
of microbial contamination, scientists say it could be used to make
sterile gauze. Although the production of cotton in vitro did not use
gene-splicing technology, it provides still another example of the
potential of reducing agricultural commodities to their component
parts and then mass-producing them.</p>
<p>Tissue culture is seen by many as the inevitable next stage of a
process that has continued to reduce the market share of farming in
the food-production system. For the better part of the twentieth
century, farming has declined in importance as an increasing number of
its activities have been expropriated by the input sector on the one
end and the marketing sector on the other. For example, chemical
fertilizers have replaced animal manuring on the farm. Commercial
pesticides have replaced crop rotation, mechanical tillage, and hand
weeding. Tractors have replaced horses and manual labor. Today only a
handful of farmers package their own produce or transport it to retail
markets. These functions have been increasingly taken over by
agri-business companies.</p>
<p>Now, chemical and pharmaceutical companies hope to use
genetic-engineering technologies to eliminate the farmer
altogether. The goal is to convert food production into a wholly
industrial process by bypassing both the organism and the outdoors,
and "farming" at the molecular level in the factory. Martin H. Rogoff
and Stephen L. Rawlins, biologists and research administrators with
the Department of Agriculture, envision a food-production system in
which fields would be planted only with perennial biomass crops. The
crops would be harvested and converted to sugar solution by the use of
enzymes. The solution would then be piped to urban factories and used
as a nutrient source to produce large quantities of pulp from tissue
cultures. The pulp would then be reconstituted and fabricated into
different shapes and textures to mimic the traditional forms
associated with "soil-grown" crops. Rawlins says that the new
factories would be highly automated and require few workers.</p>
