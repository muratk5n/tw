# Predicting Presidential Elections

One of the better known models in this area is the *Time for Change*
Model designed by A. Abramowitz. The model uses three factors—the
incumbent president’s net approval rating at the end of June (approval
minus disapproval), the change in real GDP for Q2 (as percentage) of
the election year [annualized](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-the-annual-growth-rate-for-real-g.aspx),
and a first term incumbency advantage (two terms for the incumbent
party becomes a disadvantage), to predict the winner of the national
popular vote, which can also be used as stand-in for electoral
collage.

Code is below. The fit is crazy good, Prob F near zero, R^2 at 90%,
all predictors are significant.

```python
import io, statsmodels.formula.api as smf, pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(s))
regr = 'incumbent_vote ~ gdp_growth + net_approval + two_terms + net_approval*two_terms'
results = smf.ols(regr, data=df).fit()

## 2016

We used different GDP growth and approval rating scenarios for current
adminstration come June; These are growth 1% net popularity 0, growth
3% popularity 10, and growth %5 and popularity 30. The last two cases
are pretty out there, yes; Right now Bam has 0 net popularity. We
based this on here and here. GDP can get better - maybe.

Based on this, you get

```python
conf = results.conf_int()
pred = [1., 1.0, 0., 1, 1*0]
print (np.dot(pred, conf), np.dot(pred, results.params))
pred = [1., 2.0, 5., 1, 5*1]
print (np.dot(pred, conf), np.dot(pred, results.params))
pred = [1., 3.0, 10., 1, 10*1]
print (np.dot(pred, conf), np.dot(pred, results.params))
```

For the first scenario Hillary's chances of winning are between 43%
and 52%, likely loss. The second one at 2% growth and net popularity 5
is also likely loss. The third is a toss up

[Note after the election: the final numbers were growth 1.2%, net
popularity 6, close to the second case, and HC lost the election].

It is interesting to note that Bill Clinton, known as a good
campaigner, had significant advantages going into the 1992 election
unlike his wife now going up against Trump. It is also interesting so
much hinges on a very rough number such as growth and general
popularity. But in a way this makes sense; Voting for a single person
is a blunt instrument really, hence, the basis people use to judge it
is also pretty general. Intuitively it makes sense; if a party stays
in da house too long, people want to throw you outa there, if there is
no growth, the incumbent is not popular, the climb for the candidate
from that party becomes steeper and steeper.

```python
conf = results.conf_int()
net_approv = -10.0; gdp_growth = 0.0
pred = [1., gdp_growth, net_approv, 0, net_approv*0]
print (np.dot(pred, conf), np.dot(pred, results.params))

## 2020

The massive fall in GDP QoQ decline due to covid made that part of the
pred parameter meaningless. But we can assign a zero to that
parameter, effectively taking it out of the equation, then using the
remaining incumbency, net popularity params, still can predict an
advantage for Biden, as Trump's net popularity was at -15%. Trump lost
the election.

```python
conf = results.conf_int()

net_approv = -15.0; gdp_growth = 0.0; two_terms = 0
pred = [1., gdp_growth, net_approv, two_terms, net_approv*two_terms]
print (np.dot(pred, conf), np.dot(pred, results.params))
```
