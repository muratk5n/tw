<h1>Social Democracy in a Third Wave World</h1>
<p>Nowadays, with the global economy undergoing fundamental
transformation, workers worldwide are coming under significant
pressure. Particularly in developed economies, social policies must
adjust to provide the support that lower-income groups need, while
encouraging growth and advancing wellbeing.</p>
<p>The pressure has been unrelenting and inescapable. In the United
States, real (inflation-adjusted) compensation for men with only a
high school diploma fell by 21% from 1979 to 2013. In much of Europe,
which provides stronger wage protection, unemployment has soared,
especially since the euro crisis began in 2008. Germany and some
Northern European countries remain an exception, although the German
labor market contains a large low-wage, mini-jobs segment.</p>
<p>Driving these trends is the changing nature of work. For starters,
services have been gaining ground worldwide, especially in developed
economies. From 1970 to 2012, the GDP share of services in the OECD
countries increased from 53% to 71%.</p>
<p>New technology and “intelligent” machines are not only displacing many
types of workers in both the manufacturing and services sectors; they
are also facilitating the rise of new business models, in which
individuals perform (mostly low-paid service) jobs within loose
networks, instead of as dedicated employees of structured
organizations.</p>
<p>For example, the ride-sharing service Uber now has 162,000 active
drivers in the US alone and is displacing traditional taxi
services. The startup Handy hopes that its app achieves similar
success in connecting customers to independent contractors providing
various household services. As technology races ahead and value chains
become globalized, workers must adapt, whether by changing jobs,
relocating, or acquiring new skills – a challenge that is particularly
burdensome for older workers, but demands a new approach to life
planning for all.</p>
<p>Some people – especially those who acquired valued and flexible skills
early in life, as well as those who are already in strong positions
because of inherited wealth – can flourish in this new
economy. Millions of others, however, are ill-prepared for the new
age. And it is their growing anxiety that is fueling the rise of
identity politics, with populist leaders and movements appealing to
ethnic or religious solidarity in the face of the impersonal forces of
change.</p>
