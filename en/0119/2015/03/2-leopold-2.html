<h1>II Leopold II's</h1>
<p>[King Leopold] II, remembered today as Belgium’s Builder King, reigned
from 1865 to 1909. A constitutional monarch who, like many of his
contemporaries, longed for the bygone days of absolute power, he was
nonetheless an unusually influential and activist king who helped make
Belgians free, prosperous, and secure.</p>
<p>Belgium’s good works during Leopold’s reign are almost uncountable. He
oversaw the expansion of political freedom with the adoption of
universal adult male suffrage in competitive elections, putting his
country on a firm footing to become a modern democracy. On the
economic front, he encouraged free-trade policies that guided Belgium
to remarkable growth. In little Belgium, coal production, the engine
of industry in nineteenth-century Europe, rose to such heights that it
almost equaled that of France. Social policy too moved briskly
ahead. Primary education became compulsory, and with the 1881 School
Law, girls were assured access to secondary education. Moreover,
Leopold’s policies provided greater protection for women and children
than was then the norm in most of Europe. Thanks to legislation passed
in 1889, children under twelve could not be put to work, and after
they turned twelve their workdays were limited to twelve hours, a
radical departure from prevailing policy of the time [..].</p>
<p>But then there was the Congo.</p>
<p>Though he never set foot in Africa, Leopold also ruled over the Congo
Free State for nearly a quarter of a century (1885-1908). He built his
personal wealth in the Congo first by extracting high-priced ivory
from the region and then by exploiting the even more lucrative rubber
trade that developed there. Unlike in Belgium, there was no chef de
cabinet (roughly, prime minister), and no voters among the Congo’s
approximately 30 million people to limit what he could do. Because it
was his personal property, Leopold was free to exert the absolute rule
he could not have at home [..].</p>
<p>Leopold’s “police” received low salaries but could earn big
commissions by meeting or exceeding their rubber quotas. Unrestricted
by any law governing their conduct except, literally, the law of the
jungle, and provided with a huge financial incentive through the
commission system, these soldiers of sorrow, from the very bottom of
the ladder to the very top, used whatever means they saw fit to meet
the quotas [..] Rewarded for killing people allegedly engaged in
antigovernment activities and needing to account for every bullet they
spent, soldiers quickly took to indiscriminate mutilation of innocent
souls as a way to boost their counts and thereby their fees, going so
far as to chop off the right hands of women and children to provide
evidence of their work on behalf of Leopold’s interests. Perhaps as
many as 10 million people were murdered at the hands of the Force
Publique in their pursuit of wealth for Leopold and, of course, for
themselves [..].</p>
<p>In contrast to Leopold’s progressive policies in Belgium, virtually
nothing was invested in improving conditions in the Congo. Roads were
built only where they helped move rubber to market. Laws protecting
women and children or worker’s right to strike were unheard of. Much
as Leopold worried about protecting the security of his Belgian
subjects, he worked to undermine the security of his Congolese
subjects [..].</p>
<p>How could King Leopold II have ruled two places at the same time in
such dramatically different manners?</p>
<p>It’s easy to blame Leopold’s apparent split personality—a progressive
in Belgium and a monster in the Congo—on some character flaw or on a
diseased mind. It’s also easy to explain away his horrible rule in the
Congo as typical racist behavior. These explanations feel good, but
they almost certainly cannot describe the big picture. After all, just
think about Mobutu Sese Seko, the Congo’s latter-day Leopold, the
monster in a leopard-skin hat who ruled Zaire (largely what used to be
the Congo Free State and is today the Democratic Republic of Congo)
for more than thirty years (1965—97) [..].</p>
<p>It’s nice to think that leaders who provide peace and plenty rule for
long, happy years, beloved by the people and content to do good for
them day and night. But in fact those who want to run a country for a
long time are ill advised to go around promoting peace and
prosperity. Not that making people well off is inherently bad for
leaders; it isn’t. It’s just that promoting corruption and misery is
better. That was well understood by Leopold and Mobutu in the Congo,
and is clearly understood today by the governments in places like
North Korea, Zimbabwe, Turkmenistan, Chad, Syria … sadly, the list
goes on.</p>
<p>It so happens that leaders who are really good at giving their people
life, liberty, and happiness are, overwhelmingly, democratically
elected and therefore face organized political competition. It also so
happens that they are routinely thrown out after only a short time in
office.</p>
<p>[..] Leopold ruled Belgium for forty-four years, but he was a
constitutional monarch who had to work within the constraints of the
democratic system that governed Belgium if he was to remain in power
[..].</p>
<p>It’s my claim, and it may seem controversial, that kleptocratic
leaders are not inherently evil—at least not necessarily so—and that
those who do a great job for their people in hopes of reelection are
hardly fit for sainthood. They’re all doing the right things if they
want to stay in power as long as possible. Leopold, despicable as he
was, did what worked best for him in the politically unconstrained
environment of the Congo, and he did what worked best for him in the
constitutionally limiting environment of Belgium [..].</p>
<p>The difference between doing a good job and doing a lousy job is
driven by how many people a leader has to keep happy. Why doesn’t
every leader allow cronies to loot and steal the way the Force
Publique did? Large-scale democratic leaders can’t—they have to reward
too many people to make theft and corruption work for them. In other
words, the system does not effectively incentivize that
strategy. Virtually all long-lasting (read authoritarian) leaders,
however, really depend only on a very small number of generals, senior
civil servants, and their own families for support. Because they rely
on so few people to keep them in power, they can afford to bribe them
handsomely.</p>
