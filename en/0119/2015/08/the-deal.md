# The Deal

Benjamin Netanyahu is laying siege to the Congress of the United
States, not for the first time. He has thrown his voice and channeled
his influence into the arena of American legislative politics, to
abort the nuclear P5+1 settlement with Iran, which was signed on July
14 by the US, Britain, France, Germany, China, and Russia. The Israeli
strong man's latest intervention is in keeping with the rest of his
political career. Netanyahu owes all his importance and his success to
actions that have been purely destructive.

He was first elected in 1996 on the wave of Israeli settler chauvinism
that followed the signing of the Oslo Accords. His rise came in the
wake of the assassination of his opponent, a courageous defender of
the accords, Yitzhak Rabin. A public memorandum detailing the strategy
for Netanyahu as leader of Israel was written by the neoconservative
war propagandist Richard Perle, along with a small committee of
others. The strategy document, "A Clean Break," called for Israel to
free itself from the tedious demands of diplomacy once and for all,
curtail its efforts to negotiate with Palestinians toward the creation
of a state, and give up the idea of joining a neighborhood of nations
in the Middle East. With American help, instead, Israel could stand
alone as the dominant power, a position it should never compromise by
bargaining for peace. To achieve this end, three countries had to be
undermined, subdivided, or destroyed: Iraq, Syria, and Iran.

So far, things have gone roughly according to plan. Iraq and Syria are
out of the picture -- the latter with considerable satisfaction to the
people around Netanyahu. But Iran has continued to pose a stumbling
block; and as early as 2008, Barack Obama's interest in lowering the
terrorist threat to the US by calming the violence of the region was
perceived by Netanyahu as a threat to his plan for dominance. [..]

The defection to the Republican side by Chuck Schumer was predictable,
but the terms in which he cast his decision tell us much about the man
and the situation. It has been said that one can judge a politician's
intent not only by the things he says but by the things he crucially
omits. In Schumer's written defense of his vote with the war party, in
a text of some 1,700 words apparently drafted by the senator himself,
a word that never appears is "Israel." (The exception is the almost
anonymous appearance of the country in a catalogue with five other
countries said to have been direct or indirect victims of Iran). But
depend on it, Israel was on Schumer's mind. He has often said, with an
artless self-love, that his name in Hebrew, "shomer," means
"guardian"; and he takes pride in the fact because he thinks of
himself as the appointed guardian of Israel's interests in the US. How
bizarre and again how unprecedented this is! Think of any other nation
in the world. Imagine an Italian-American named Frank Consiglieri
assuring his listeners that his name means "advocate" in Italian and
he is supremely vigilant for the interests of Italy as a lawmaker in
the US [..]

How many Americans know that the Iran deal is supported by the vast
majority of Israel's defense and security establishment? The opinions
of the security officials within Netanyahu's government are impossible
to discern because they have been placed under gag order; but the
suffrage of qualified judges in Israel, as also in Europe, Russia,
China, and the IAEA, forms a strange contrast with the current
alignments in America. "As unanimous as the politicians are in backing
the prime minister," J.J. Goldberg recently wrote in Forward, "the
generals and spymasters are nearly as unanimous in questioning
him. Generals publicly backing Netanyahu can be counted on -- well --
one finger." Equally strange is the fact that security support for the
deal is an open secret in the Israeli press, and in an American Jewish
paper like Forward, but the evidence is subordinated to a point of
near invisibility in the New York Times and other American outlets.
