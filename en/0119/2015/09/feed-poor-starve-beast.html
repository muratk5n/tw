<h1>Feed the Poor, Starve the Beast</h1>
<p>This fall [.. Swiss a]ctivists delivered 125,000 signatures — enough
to trigger a Swiss public referendum, this time on providing a monthly
income to every citizen, no strings attached. Every month, every Swiss
person would receive a check from the government, no matter how rich
or poor, how hardworking or lazy, how old or young. Poverty would
disappear. [..]</p>
<p>Go to a cocktail party in Berlin, and there is always someone spouting
off about the benefits of a basic income, just as you might hear
someone talking up Robin Hood taxes in New York or single-payer health
care in Washington. And it’s not only in vogue in wealthy
Switzerland. Beleaguered and debt-wracked Cyprus is weighing the
implementation of basic incomes, too. They even are whispered about in
the United States, where certain wonks on the libertarian right and
liberal left have come to a strange convergence around the idea — some
prefer an unconditional “basic” income that would go out to everyone,
no strings attached; others a means-tested “minimum” income to
supplement the earnings of the poor up to a given level.</p>
<p>The case from the right is one of expediency and efficacy. Let’s say
that Congress decided to provide a basic income through the tax code
or by expanding the Social Security program. Such a system might work
better and be fairer than the current patchwork of programs, including
welfare, food stamps and housing vouchers. A single father with two
jobs and two children would no longer have to worry about the hassle
of visiting a bunch of offices to receive benefits. And giving him a
single lump sum might help him use his federal dollars better. Housing
vouchers have to be spent on housing, food stamps on food. Those
dollars would be more valuable — both to the recipient and the economy
at large — if they were fungible.</p>
<p>Even better, conservatives think, such a program could significantly
reduce the size of our federal bureaucracy. It could take the place of
welfare, food stamps, housing vouchers and hundreds of other programs,
all at once: Hello, basic income; goodbye, H.U.D. Charles Murray of
the conservative American Enterprise Institute has proposed a minimum
income for just that reason — feed the poor, and starve the
beast. “Give the money to the people,” Murray wrote in his book “In
Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State.” He suggested
guaranteeing $10,000 a year to anyone meeting the following
conditions: be American, be over 21, stay out of jail and — as he once
quipped — “have a pulse.”</p>
<p>The left is more concerned with the power of a minimum or basic income
as an anti-poverty and pro-mobility tool. There happens to be some
hard evidence to bolster the policy’s case. In the mid-1970s, the tiny
Canadian town of Dauphin ( the “garden capital of Manitoba” ) acted as
guinea pig for a grand experiment in social policy called “Mincome.”
For a short period of time, all the residents of the town received a
guaranteed minimum income. About 1,000 poor families got monthly
checks to supplement their earnings.</p>
<p>Evelyn Forget, a health economist at the University of Manitoba, has
done some of the best research on the results. Some of her findings
were obvious: Poverty disappeared. But others were more surprising:
High-school completion rates went up; hospitalization rates went
down. “If you have a social program like this, community values
themselves start to change,” Forget said [..]</p>
<p>There’s a deeper, scarier reason that arguments for guaranteed incomes
have resurfaced of late. Wages are stagnant, unemployment is high and
tens of millions of families are struggling in Europe and here at
home. Despite record corporate earnings and skyrocketing fortunes for
the college-educated and already well-off, the job market is simply
not rewarding many fully employed workers with a decent way of
life. Millions of households have had no real increase in earnings
since the late 1980s.</p>
