<h1>GIIPS and BELLs</h1>
<p>Economists lament that they cannot conduct scientific experiments on
national economies because many variables cannot be controlled and
processes cannot be replicated. But certain cases have enough
controlled variables to produce telling results when divergent polices
are pursued under similar conditions. Two such quasi-experiments
involving the BELLs have played out recently. The first contrasts the
BELLs and the GIIPS; the second contrasts each BELLs member to the
others.</p>
<p>Experiments are typically conducted by controlling certain variables
among all participants and measuring differences in the factors that
are not controlled. The first control variable in this real-world
experiment is that neither the BELLs [Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania] nor the GIIPS [Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain]
devalued their currencies. The BELLs have maintained a local currency
peg to the euro and have not devalued. Indeed, Estonia actually joined
the euro on January 1, 2011, at the height of anti-euro hysteria, and
Latvia joined on January 1, 2014.</p>
<p>The second control variable is the depth of the economic collapse in
both the BELLs and the GIIPS beginning in 2008 and continuing into
2009. Each BELL suffered approximately a 20 percent decline in output
in those two years, and unemployment reached 20 percent. The decline
in output in the GIIPS in the same period was only slightly less. The
third control variable is that both the BELLs and the GIIPS suffered
an evaporation of direct foreign investment and lost access to capital
markets, a shortfall that had to be made up with various forms of
official assistance. In short, the BELLs and the GIIPS both
experienced collapsing output, rising unemployment, and a sudden stop
in foreign investment in 2008 and 2009. At the same time, the
governments never seriously considered devaluation, despite wails from
the pundits. From these comparable initial conditions, divergent
policies were pursued.</p>
<p>The GIIPS initially continued so-called economic stimulus and made
only slight cuts in public spending. Greece actually increased the
number of government employees between 2010 and 2011. The principal
way of addressing fiscal issues in the GIIPS was through tax
increases. The internal adjustment process of lowering unit labor
costs began in the GIIPS only in 2010, and serious fiscal and labor
market reform was begun in 2013; much work remains.</p>
<p>In contrast, the BELLs took immediate, drastic measures to put their
fiscal houses in order, and strong growth resumed as early as 2010 and
is now the highest in the EU. The turnaround was dramatic. [..] The
BELLs’ success in quickly restoring growth and competitiveness
contrasts sharply with the GIIPS, which have stretched the process out
over six years and still have a considerable way to go to achieve
fiscal sustainability.</p>
<p>If not a perfectly controlled experiment, the contrast between the
BELLs’ and the GIIPS’ policy choices is a powerful case study. The
findings show that economic prudence works and Keynesian-style
stimulus fails. The results are not surprising, given Keynesianism’s
dismal track record over the decades and the lack of empirical support
for its claims.</p>
