# Hanging On For Dear Life

The June 7 elections in Turkey spelled the end of 13 years of
single-party rule by the [AKP]. The electorate's messages were
clear. First and foremost, in the most decisive way, the electorate
denied Erdoğan his wish to become the all-powerful executive president
of a transformed Turkish political system. The electorate mandated
parliament to assume its powers and asked that the political parties
form a coalition government that would break the immense
centralization and concentration of power in Erdoğan's hand.

Following the elections, the country's three opposition parties --
which collectively make up a majority in parliament -- might have
reopened a parliamentary investigation into corruption allegations
against Erdoğan, members of his family, his ministers and his cronies
in the media, construction and energy sectors. However, like the
Ottoman sultans of centuries past, Erdoğan resorted to all manner of
intrigue to undermine his political opponents and protect
himself. Flouting long-standing precedent, Erdoğan has not allowed any
party leader other than Prime Minister Davutoğlu to try to form a
government, thwarting efforts to build a coalition within a 45-day
window and forcing the country to hold new elections on Nov. 1. Thus,
Turkey will hold general elections for the second time this year -- a
first in its more than six decades of multi-party democracy [..]
Erdoğan is saying to voters: give me the majority I need to change the
constitution, or suffer the consequences. This has not proved to be an
empty threat.

Since June 7, Turkey has gradually begun to spiral out of control,
with a plummeting currency [..]

In December of 2013, police and prosecutors launched an investigation
into major allegations of AKP corruption. The numerous charges
included the awarding of plots of land in prime Istanbul locations to
construction firms close to Erdoğan; the smuggling of gold to Iran;
and bribes totaling millions of dollars. Erdoğan [..] dismissed from
duty all prosecutors and police officers involved in the
case. Erdoğan's echo chamber in the media quickly followed suit,
claiming that western countries were conspiring against Turkey. Though
the legal investigation itself was called off, dozens of recordings
were uploaded to YouTube (where they generated millions of hits)
containing incriminating conversations by Erdoğan and his family
members, his ministers and his business cronies. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu,
the leader of the main opposition party, the CHP, has called for a
renewal of the corruption investigations; Kılıçdaroğlu has stirred up
controversy in the past by referring to Erdoğan as the "prime thief"
and the AKP government as a "kleptocratic regime."

The AKP's supporters have mostly shrugged off such accusations,
pointing to the rise in living standards under Erdoğan -- a viewpoint
summed up by the slogan "they steal, but they get things done." But
the surfacing of such massive evidence of corruption has cost the AKP
in the ballot box: for the first time since 2002, the party has lost
its majority in Parliament. The corruption files will almost certainly
be reopened -- heralding the beginning of the end for Erdoğan and his
circle. Erdoğan evidently hopes that if the peace process with the PKK
unravels and the fighting resumes, the resulting chaos will turn the
tide in his favor in the Nov. 1 elections. But this desperate strategy
is fraught with peril.
