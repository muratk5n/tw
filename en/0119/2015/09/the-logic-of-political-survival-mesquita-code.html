<h1>The Logic of Political Survival Code</h1>
<p><a href="the-logic-of-political-survival-mesquita.html">Article</a></p>
<p>B. de Mesquita's research indicates democratic nations are richer, and
they are richer because of democracy. The relationship is not mere
correlation - it is causation. But we need to define democracy
carefully.</p>
<p>A country's well-being depends on the size of its "winning coalition",
let's give it the variable W, the larger the better (in democratic
countries W is the entire population).</p>
<p>Winning coalition W is # of people whose support a leader needs to
rule, this is the group of people he needs to keep happy to stay in
power, selectorate S is the # of people from among which members of W
are recruited.</p>
<p>With small W, leader only needs to keep a small group happy paying
them off is easier, with large W, bribe becomes harder so leader must
emphasize public services, striving to be elected on the basis of
policy. S in a democracy is the entire electorate, for autocracies a
much smaller group would do i.e. the military, or some sort of
"guard", or a single party out of which even a smaller W would select
the leader.</p>
<p>In The Logic of Political Survival BBM makes the case that it is
better to use W as a measure of better governance. According to this
research increases in W effect GDP growth positively. Here is the
causation part - BdM calculates increase in W based as difference
between W of two years ago and calculates its relation between the
current year's growth. The relation exists.</p>
<p>BdM also controls for what it is traditionally known as democracy. In
a separate regression he takes out effects of W,S from inside this
traditional "democracy" variable, so what remains (the residuals) are
taken to be all other parts (benefits?) of democracy that is not
related to W or S. This residual has no effect on the regression,
meaning traditional concept of democracy is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis is that there is a dependence between kleptocracy
and W, S; and yes the book finds government theft is maximal when W is
small and S is large, signifying a rigged electoral system where the
electorate is large but their votes do not count, an inner circle
decides everything. With bigger W, kleptocracy decreases.</p>
<p>Once the general richness of society is accounted for, there is a
negative correlation between construction (an area ripe for government
theft) and the winning coalition size, W, meaning better governance
means less construction that involve theft. Rich societies naturally
build more, or they build in proportion to their income, and if they
are governed well no more than necessary. The "more" of this extra
construction can involve shady dealings and that part is caught by the
regression.</p>
<p>There's a very nicely prepared dataset associated with the book The
Logic of Political Survival (2003) written by Bruce B. Mesquita et
al. along with code that can reproduce its statistical results. BBM is
famous for The Predictioneer's Game (2009), where he detailed the use
of game theory for negotations / war. It turns out he had another
theory on governments, democracies, dictatorships in the earlier
book. In this earlier work the claim is that it is not enough to use
labels such as democracy, autocracy to describe / predict which
countries to develop and others not. His main thesis is that the two
most important variables in a country are W and S, the
winning-coalition size and the selectorate size.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/data/">Original Dataset</a></p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=13QdSpzbPaJXTr50fuwdKjHpS3iBD6n-c">My CSV Version</a></p>
<p>Winning coalition W is # of ppl whose support a leader needs to rule,
this is the group of people he needs to keep happy to stay in power,
selectorate S is the # of people from among which members of W are
recruited. With small W, leader only needs to keep a small group happy
paying them off is easier, with large W, bribe becomes harder so
leader must emphasize public services, striving to be elected on the
basis of policy. S in a democracy is the entire electorate, for
autocracies a much smaller group would do i.e. the military, or some
sort of "guard", or a single party out of which even a smaller W would
select the leader.</p>
<p>BBM hypothizes there is a dependence between kleptocracy and W, S; he
finds government theft is maximal when W is small and S is large,
signifying a rigged electoral system where the electorate is large but
their votes do not count, an inner circle decides everything. With
bigger W, kleptocracy decreases.</p>
<p>A counterargument could be there is a hidden effect of population size
on theft, more people, more revenue hence more chances to steal, or
even foreign aid can tip the balance, but BBM "accounts for those
variables (a statistics term)" in his calculations ,taking their
effect out, keeping the focus on W and S. Kleptocracy value itself is
the absolute value difference between tax revenue and expenditures in
proportion to GDP. Absolute value is used because both deficits and
surpluses can be a sign of theft; leader can steal surplus revenue
after its reported or, overspend (on cronies, on their insane pet
projects) which would result in deficit.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis is there is positive relationship between W and
income, countries with larger winning-coalitions are richer, and this
is also confirmed. With everything else the same a country going from
W=0 to W=1 would add 3.0% growth to per capita income. This could seem
small, but if you take per capita income 10,000 dollars in 10 years,</p>
<p><code>R=0.03; print 10*1000 * ((1+R)**10.)</code></p>
<p>it becomes a whopping 13,439 dollars. So increasing the winning
coalition to its maximum from the worst adds to per capita more than
3,000 dollars.</p>

<p>I ran the regressions <a href="lops1.html">myself</a>, both as ordinary linear
regression and as a multilevel model using region/year as the group. I
was able to reproduce results close to what BBM reports, I say close
because I left out some variables (the stuff that BBM ended up finding
unimportant). In kleptocracy model for example R^2 is 20% (BBM gets
over 40%) which is very good. All variables are significant.</p>
<p><a href="lops2.html">Here</a> is how to reproduce W from scratch.</p>
<p>There is some mad skillz displayed in accounting for "traditional
democratic" effects that could be seperate from W and S. For that, BBM
take W,S into regression against Polity's democracy, takes the
residuals, feeds them into the main regression coupled with their
variable in question. This way traditional democratic effects, or what
Polity thinks as democracy is controlled for, only coalition and
selectorate size effect remain. F..in A.</p>
<p>I used a combination of Python and R. The book uses Stata (a closed
source software -nasty- but I was glad to have some software
accompanying the book).</p>
<p>[/geek]</p>
<p>Calculating actual W and S is the tricky business. Ideally you'd want
to know the exact size, let's say country X has a military
dictatorship, the military size is 100K, out of which a junta of size
10 rules the country, then S=100K and W=10. But this kind of data is
hard to collect, the authors decided to use another dataset's base
variables to derive W and S. This formula is educational on its
own. The dataset is <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html">Polity IV</a>, famous for capturing
some base variables on countries' democratic development which also
has its own <code>democracy</code> variable that BBM et. al did not use directly,
the variables used for W derivation are <code>RegimeType</code>, <code>xrcomp</code>, <code>xropen</code>,
<code>parcomp</code>.</p>
<p>Among these <code>parcomp</code> was interesting for me, getting a 5 on that adds
a 1 to your score, and many countries including Turkland has a 4, and
you look up the description for that in Polity manual which says: (4)
Transitional: Any transitional arrangement from [1,2,3] patterns to
fully [5] patterns [..]. Transitional arrangements are accommodative
of competing, parochial interests but have not fully linked parochial
with broader, general interests.  This is funny bcz the presence of
"parochial interests" is a good word to describe TR at the moment.</p>
<p>The best score for W is 1.0. Some surprises, Singapore is rightly
known for its lack of democracy and it gets a 0.4 from Polity, but its
W is 0.75, a score shared by Venezuella and TR. US before Civil War
scores 0.95 on democracy but 0.75 on W. In all these cases W does a
better job in capturing the essence of a regime.</p>
<p>The research in this book appears to have evolved into The Dictator's
Handbook, again by BBM.</p>
<p><a name='elections'></a></p>
<p>Elections</p>
<p>US elections (most likely elections in other democratic countries as
well) are decided as a go / no-go decision on the incumbent
party. While judging the incumbent only three variables are used: GDP
growth, party incumbency (second term or not), and incumbent
executive's net approval rating. The prediction works very well on
almost all US election data.</p>
<p>It is interesting the analysis works well with such rough / few
numbers such as growth and general popularity. But in a way this makes
sense; Voting for a single person is a blunt instrument really, hence,
the basis people use to judge it is also pretty general. If a party
stays in power for too long, people want to throw them out, if there
is no growth, the incumbent is not popular, the climb for the
candidate from that party becomes steeper and steeper. The method is
very smart in some sense because the only reliable data the electorate
has can only be based on existing accomplishments (through these
general variables), that's why the vote is based incumbent, i.e. the
person on whom people have the best available data.</p>
<p><a name='policy'></a></p>
<p>People do not judge candidates by looking at the totality of their
policy positions (hmm I assign a number from 1 to 10 to each position,
then average them all, compare both candidates,that is the likelihood
of my vote). People are much better deciding on people, not on
issues. This also implies that a win does not validate a politician's
all policy positions, since people mostly did not give a shit about
them. Taking the vote as a confirmation of all previously positions,
locking them in, or thinking people are some kind of magical policy
oracle is a fallacy. Everyone has a job to do - modernity is based on
the division of labor. Post-modernity could be something else, we are
not there yet.</p>
<p>Which election system is best? BdM has good things to say on the
French run-off system, being more demanding. From BdM's The Dictator's
Handbook:</p>
<p>"It is worth observing that the United States has one of the world’s
biggest winning coalitions both in absolute numbers and as a
proportion of the electorate. But it is not the biggest. Britain’s
parliamentary structure requires the prime minister to have the
support of a little over 25 percent of the electorate in two-party
elections to parliament. That is, the prime minister generally needs
at least half the members of parliament to be from her party and for
each of them to win half the vote (plus one) in each two-party
parliamentary race: half of half of the voters, or one quarter in
total. France’s runoff system is even more demanding. Election
requires that a candidate win a majority in the final, two-candidate
runoff."</p>
<p>Coalitions</p>
<p>In democratically backward countries that live in a comotose,
proto-fascistic state a "coalition" is created <em>beforehand</em>, in the
mind of a fascist, and any ideology that is outside of this legit mix
is immediately delegitimized. This is a mistake. The emergent,
self-organized blocks of ideologies, as clusters, carry within a good
signal, if enough though leaders coalesced around something, chances
are there is an approach that needs representing.</p>
<p>Logistically coalitions are fine, but you need ideologically distinct
parties.. There can be no gaps, nothing left out, otherwise fascists
will step in to fill the void. Obviously some coalitions will be able
to deliver more than others, but at least seperate parties decide how
that coalition is formed, on their own terms. Each viewpoint
contributes, and by <a href="../../2020/07/crowd-wisdom.html">averaging</a>
the optimal decision is reached.</p>
<p>BTW "average" could also be a long-run average between two (or more)
views (cld be immed avg too). One party cld be for 30% tax rate,
another for 70%. Each enact their thing one in power, if they can,
long-running average is 50%.</p>
<p><a name='war'></a></p>
<p>War</p>
<p>Democracies are better at war. They win almost all the wars they start
and about two-thirds of the wars in which they are targets of
aggression. Democracies are better able to make war
collectively. Autocracies, with the small winning coalitions [..] tend
to seek private benefits from fighting. A thirst for private goods
means that autocracies optimize at a smaller coalition size to avoid
diluting the spoils of war. Democracies, in contrast, already supply
public goods to large domestic winning coalitions [4]. In essence,
since democratic leaders need to inform the public and provide public
goods, and war is always ugly, they have a huge interest in finishing
the war as soon as possible. To that end they mobilize better, plan
more effectively and fight to finish. This makes them better
fighters. Autocrats can hide the goings-on of a war, so they would
never feel the pressure to finish, hence do not fight in a way that'll
help them do so. The war drags on.</p>
