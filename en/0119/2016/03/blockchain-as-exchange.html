<h1>Blockchain as an Exchange</h1>
<p>It's the sort of deal that could revolutionise markets. Salt Lake City online retailer Overstock is trying to prove it can do without stock exchanges and hangers-on like brokers by issuing bonds and shares on its own blockchain-based exchange.</p>

<p>"Blockchain is a new way of sharing data and information between parties that are naturally connected to each other that creates a single indisputable version of the truth," he told the Financial Review Business Summit.[..]</p>
