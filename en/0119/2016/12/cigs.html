<h1>Cigs</h1>
<p>It is increasingly common for governments to give poor people
money. Rather than grant services or particular goods to those in
poverty, such as food or housing, governments have found that it is
more effective and efficient to simply hand out cash. [..]</p>
<p>For decades, policymakers have been concerned that poor people will
waste free money by using it on cigarettes and alcohol. A report on
the perception of stakeholders in Kenya about such programs found a
“widespread belief that cash transfers would either be abused or
misdirected in alcohol consumption and other non-essential forms of
consumption.”</p>
<p>The opposite is true.</p>
<p>A recently published research paper (paywall) by David Evans of the
World Bank and Anna Popova of Stanford University shows that giving
money to the poor has a negative effect on the consumption of tobacco
and alcohol. Evans and Popova’s research is based on an examination of
nineteen studies that assess the impact of cash transfers on
expenditures of tobacco and alcohol. Not one of the 19 studies found
that cash grants increase tobacco and alcohol consumption and many of
them found that it leads to a reduction.</p>
<p>In addition to looking at results from individual studies, the
researchers also conducted a meta-analysis—a statistical technique for
combining the results from across studies—to find the overall effect
on tobacco and alcohol consumption of receiving cash. Their
meta-analysis found that the overall effect was slightly negative.</p>
<p>Why on earth would this be? Evans and Popova highlight several
possibilities.</p>
<p>One, the cash transfers may change a poor household’s economic
calculus. Before receiving the cash, any spending on education or
health might have seemed futile, but afterwards, parents might decide
that a serious investment in their children’s school was sensible. To
make this happen, it might mean cutting back on booze and smoking.</p>
