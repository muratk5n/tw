# Low Rates

[T]he young adults of the 1980s paid the highest interest rates in
history on their mortgages and car loans. Now, they are approaching
retirement - indeed the oldest among them have already retired. And
today's ultra-low interest rates seem like a major betrayal. Where
have the returns on their savings gone?

This is a bigger problem than it might seem. In the 1980s, companies
started to replace defined-benefit pensions, which promised an income
based on final salary, with defined-contribution pensions, where the
returns on investment provide an income in retirement. By the
mid-1990s, most defined-benefit schemes were closed to new entrants.

Replacing defined-benefit with defined-contribution didn't seem that
big a deal at the time. Some people even thought it was better. After
all, with the rates prevailing at the time, you wouldn't need a huge
investment portfolio to generate quite a decent income in
retirement. It never occurred to anyone that interest rates would
fall.

And yet they were already falling. All three charts show that interest
rates have fallen steadily since their 1980 peak. In fact John
Williams's chart shows that real interest rates have fallen rather
less in the UK than elsewhere: but it is nominal interest rates that
people understand. Now, people are not going to get anything like the
returns on their pension investments that they expected. Nor on any
other form of savings, either. If anything, private pensions and life
insurance schemes look even worse than defined-contribution corporate
schemes, and the interest rates on liquid savings such as ISAs are
approaching zero.

Over at Bond Vigilantes, Jim Leaviss has an excellent explanation of
the rise and fall of post-war interest rates. I have shamelessly
borrowed his charts. This one wonderfully shows how the anomalously
high interest rates of the 1980s and 90s were entirely due to the baby
boom [..]

And here is Jim's verbal explanation: "The relatively low supply of
labour in the 1970s gave power to those of working age. Trade union
membership peaked in the late 1970s (when 12 million people in the UK
were members) and wage growth outstripped productivity growth and
inflation. Government debt burdens grew, and interest rates and bond
yields hit double digits. There were talks of ‘buyers’ strikes’ by
institutional gilt investors in the UK.

But as the baby-boomers entered the workforce after school or college,
there was a significant improvement in the demographic trends. From
that low of 40% in 1975, by the end of the 1980s the ratio of workers
to non-workers was back above 50%, peaking at over 60% by the end of
the 20th century. The developed world had become a world with lots of
workers, keeping inflation low (trade union membership shrank),
producing tax revenue to reduce government borrowing (at times in the
US there was even discussion about retiring the national debt), and
investing in paper assets like government bonds to provide future
incomes in retirement. Inflation collapsed (you could argue that
central banks, despite becoming fierce inflation fighters over this
period, starting with Paul Volker taking over at the US Federal
Reserve in late 1979, should take little credit here; the demographics
did the heavy lifting) and 10-year US Treasury bond yields halved from
nearly 13% at the start of the 1980s to 6.5% by the end of the 1990s".

Now the baby boomers are leaving the workforce, we should expect
interest rates to rise. So perhaps the baby boomers were not
unreasonable in expecting their investments of the 1980s and 90s to
deliver a comfortable retirement. Something has gone badly wrong. But
what?

Jim identifies five reasons why interest rates have failed to
recover. To many people, they will be all too familiar.

Globalisation: offshoring of jobs to cheaper locations and competition
from cheaper imports, putting downwards pressure on wages and
prices. In the UK, this was compounded by immigration from the EU.

The Great Financial Crisis of 2008: deliberate cuts in interest rates,
interventionist central banks preventing buyers' strikes, financial
repression and poor wage growth

Technology: progressive replacement of humans with robots causes wages
and prices to fall

Longevity and under-saving: people are living longer, and as already
mentioned, older workers have not saved enough, so they are staying in
the workforce for longer

China's influence on the US Treasury bond yield (which influences all
other government bond yields)

As Jim says, "the simplicity of demographic models was attractive, but
what worked in a closed economy failed in a connected world".

For young people, today's low interest rates mean that they have to
save much more and take more investment risk to achieve the sort of
income in retirement that the post-war generation had. But those who
were young adults in the 1980s and 90s don't have enough of their
working lives left to build up the size of pension pot now needed to
generate a comfortable retirement income. They are looking at a much
less prosperous retirement than they expected.

I suspect that the bleaker future facing Britain's older working-age
people might help to explain why a high proportion of them
self-identify as "have nots", according to a recent survey by Britain
Thinks (bottom LH quadrant):

This might go some way towards answering Rick's question - "why are
baby boomers so angry"?Younger boomers - those now aged 50-64 - have
reason to be angry, as indeed do their 40-something brothers and
sisters. Their wages have been stagnant for a decade, their
occupational pensions are stuffed and their state pensions are
receding into the distance. They are frightened of cuts to the
healthcare they will need in retirement and worried that they may have
to sell their houses to pay for their care. Many of them blame their
precarious financial situation on globalisation, immigration and
bankers. And if Jim is right, they have a point.

So they want to shut the doors, cut the trade ties, kill the parasite
financial services industry and jail the bankers. Then they can have
their high interest rates back. After all, they paid those rates on
their mortgages. Now they expect to receive them on their
savings. It's only fair.

And they paid in for their pensions and their healthcare, too. So
close the tax loopholes, make the rich pay their fair share and honour
the pensions and universal healthcare promises of the past. It's only
fair.

There are an awful lot of the baby boomers, and they vote. What they
regard as "fair" will dominate political debate for quite a while to
come. Resurgent populism now woos the old, not the young.

This leaves me with two unanswered questions. Firstly, why did people
fail to see that the high interest rates of the 1980s and 1990s were
anomalous? And secondly, why do Williams and others think low interest
rates are here to stay? After all, if people in the 1980s could
erroneously believe that high interest rates would last forever,
people in 2016 can equally wrongly think that low interest rates are
here to stay.
