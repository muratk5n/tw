<h1>My Data, Your Data</h1>
<p>The Allen Institute for Brain Science released a landmark set of data
[..] it contains a vast array of recordings from the bit of cortex
that deals with vision [..] The release of this data took a privately
funded institute. It could not have come from a publicly-funded
scientist. It is a striking case-study in how modern science is
worryingly broken, because it prioritises private achievement over the
public good [..]</p>
<p>Most scientists would never even contemplate such a
manoeuvre. Research needs grants to fund it, and grants need
papers. Promotion needs papers. Tenure need papers. Postdoc positions
need papers. Even PhD studentships need papers now, God help us
all. Everything needs bloody papers. (Which works well for people like
me who enjoy writing; but is a distinct disadvantage for talented
scientists who don’t.)</p>
<p>(Last semester, we even got a Faculty-wide email encouraging us to
write up our Master’s students’ project work for publication. Because
what science needs right now is more unfinished crap.)  Data makes
papers. Data makes grants. Who would ever release data without first
writing up a paper? Who would fund grants to work on data that you’ve
already released? Which committees recognise “releasing data” as a
principal output when looking for a new job candidate or a promotion?
Or assessing the research quality of a university?</p>
<p>This all means I’m feeling rather ambivalent about the “Brain
Observatory” data. On the one hand, I deeply admire that the
philanthropic principles of the Allen Institute extend to giving away
their data for free. On the other hand, I’m deeply sad that it takes a
billionaire software designer’s philanthropy to make such a thing
happen.</p>
