<h1>Netanyahu Didn't Ruin Israeli Democracy. The Occupation Did</h1>
<p>After some hesitation, I won’t be voting Likud in the next election or
probably in the election after that, but Carolina Landsmann found that
I had great admiration for the leader of the party, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu (Haaretz, August 19). Most of the anger engendered
in Landsmann and others was the last sentence that I wrote about
Netanyahu’s meeting with Haaretz’s editorial staff: “Given the current
proposed alternatives, we may even, God forbid, come to miss him.”
(Haaretz, August 18). In light of the candidates to succeed him, I
repeat that we indeed are liable to miss him, God forbid.</p>
<p>Longing is sometimes a relative emotion. Who would have imagined that
former culture and sports minister Limor Livnat would one day be seen
as a rock of liberalism and a beacon of intellect? Compared to her
successor, Miri Regev, one longs for Livnat. Large portions of the
Zionist left see Netanyahu’s removal from office as the be-all and
end-all. If we were only rid of his demon, things would be good here
[..]</p>
<p>Everything bad began with his governance and will end when it
ends. Just give us his head. It’s a typical delusion. It absolves one
of responsibility. Netanyahu has brought disasters on Israel, as I
also wrote, but he has only continued the process of rot that began
well before him and will also continue long after him, considering his
successors. Would the Zionist Union’s Isaac Herzog make peace? Would
Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid end the occupation? Former IDF chief of staff
Gabi Ashkenazi? These are summer jokes. Lapid heads a dark, tyrannical
party ruled by the man at the top alone. While Netanyahu meets with
members of the editorial staff of a newspaper that attacks him, Lapid
the democrat calls for it to be boycotted because of what was written
about him. Netanyahu’s detractors say he is destroying democracy, as
if Israel had been a Scandinavian democracy until the great dictator
came along and ruined it.</p>
<p>It’s true that Netanyahu declared war on the wheels of democracy, but
had they been fulfilling their role prior to that? Who? The Supreme
Court, which has never gotten in the way of the occupation? The media,
which has never really covered it? Has the educational system not
carried out brainwashing? Did discrimination against Arabs just begin
after Netanyahu warned that they were streaming to the polls? Hadn’t
Lapid before him, in reference to Arab Knesset member Haneen Zoabi,
spoken of “Zoabis”? Hasn’t Herzog spoken of “Arab lovers”? And the
apartheid in the territories? And the mass arrests?</p>
<p>Everything is Netanyahu’s doing? The most critical damage to Israeli
democracy is from the occupation. Netanyahu didn’t start it. His
successors won’t put an end to it. Everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>We’ll miss Netanyahu if his successors are worse than he is. Yes,
there is such a thing as worse than Netanyahu. There are those more
bellicose and dangerous than he is, and above all, there are the
hollow and cynical opportunists. One can quibble over whether
Netanyahu is an ideologue. I believe he is. But there’s no disputing
what is motivating his potential successors. None of them (except
perhaps for Naftali Bennett of Habayit Hayehudi) is motivated by
ideology. Landsmann believes that there is no benefit to ideology
since, after all, Hitler and Stalin were ideologues, but in the
reality of Israel, there is no danger greater than populism. [..]</p>
