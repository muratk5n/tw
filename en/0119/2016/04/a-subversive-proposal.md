# A Subversive Proposal

Stevan Harnad’s “Subversive Proposal” came of age last year [an
Internet posting by Harnad on 1994  calling on all authors of research
writings to archive their articles for free for everyone online]. I’m
now teaching students younger than Stevan’s proposal, and yet, very
little has actually changed in these 21 years. On the contrary, one
may even make the case that while efforts like institutional
repositories (green OA), open access journals (gold OA) or preprint
archives have helped to make some of the world’s scholarly literature
more accessible (estimated to now be at more than 40% of newly
published papers), we are now facing problems much more pernicious
than lacking access: most of our data and essentially all of our
scientific source code is not being archived nor shared, our incentive
structure still rewards sloppy or fraudulent scientists over
meticulous, honest ones, and the ratchet of competing for grants just
to keep the lights in the lab on is driving the smartest young minds
out of academia, while GlamHumping marketeers accumulate.

While one may not immediately acknowledge the connection between
access to the literature and the more pernicious problems I’ve alluded
to, I’d argue that by ceding our control over our literature to
commercial publishers, we have locked ourselves into an anachronistic
system which is the underlying cause for most if not all our current
woes. If that were indeed the case, then freeing us from this system
is the key to solving all the associated problems.

Some data to support this perspective: we are currently spending about
US$ 10b annually on legacy publishers, when we could publish fully
open access for about US$200m per year if we only were to switch
publishing to, e.g. SciELO, or any other such system. In fact, I’d
argue that the tax payer has the right to demand that we use their tax
funds only for the least expensive publishing option. This means it is
our duty to the citizens to reduce our publishing expenses to no more
than currently ~US$200m per year (and we would even increase the value
of the literature by making it open to boot!). If we were to do that,
we’d have US$9.8b every single year to buy all the different
infrastructure solutions that already exist to support all our
intellectual outputs, be that text, data or code. Without journals
(why would one keep those?), we’d also be switching to different
metrics to assist us in minimizing the inherent biases peer-review
necessarily brings about. We would hence be able not only to provide
science with a modern scholarly infrastructure, we could even use the
scientific method to assist us in identifying the most promising new
scientists and which of them deserve which kind of support.

While many of the consequences of wasting these infrastructure funds
on publishers have become apparent only more recently, the
indefensibility of ever-increasing subscription pricing in a time of
record-low publishing costs, was already apparent 20 years ago. Hence,
already in 1994, it became obvious that one way of freeing ourselves
from the subscription-shackles was to make the entire scholarly
literature available online, free to read. Collectively, these two
decade-long concerted efforts of the global OA community, to wrestle
the knowledge of the world from the hands of the publishers, one
article at a time, has resulted in about 27 million (24%) of about 114
million English-language articles becoming publicly accessible by
2014. Since then, one single woman has managed to make a whopping 48
million paywalled articles publicly accessible. In terms of making the
knowledge of the world available to the people who are the rightful
owners, this woman, Alexandra Elbakyan, has single-handedly been more
successful than all OA advocates and activists over the last 20 years
combined.

Let that accomplishment sink in for a minute.

Of course it isn’t all global cheering and party
everywhere. Obviously, the publishers complain that she used her site,
Sci-Hub, to ‘steal their content‘ – with their content being of course
the knowledge of the world that they have been holding hostage for a
gigantic ransom. For 20 years this industry has thrived at the public
teat, parasitizing an ever-increasing stream of tax-funded subsidies
to climb from record profits to record profits, financial crises be
damned. Of course, they are very happy to seize on this opportunity to
distract from the real problems we’re facing, by staging a lawsuit to
keep their doomed business practices running for yet a little
longer. Perhaps more amusingly, one suggestion from the publishers of
how to respond to Sci-Hub is to make access even more restrictive and
expensive. I’ve only been around the OA movement for 10 years, but the
ignorance, the gall and the sheer greed of publishers has astounded me
time and time again.

Essentially, in my experience, the only reply we ever got from
publishers to our different approaches to reform our infrastructure,
has been one big raised middle finger. Clearly, two decades of
negotiations, talks and diplomacy have led us nowhere. In my opinion,
the time to be inclusive has come and passed. Publishers have opted to
remain outside of the scholarly community and work against it, rather
than with it. Actions of civil disobedience like those of Aaron Swartz
and Alexandra Elbakyan are a logical consequence of two decades of
stalled negotiations and failed reform efforts.
