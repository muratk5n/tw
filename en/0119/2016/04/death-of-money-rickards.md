# The Death of Money

From the James Rickards book

Money Laundering 101

A favorite method [for money laundering in China] is to establish a
relationship with a corrupt casino operator in Macao, where a
high-rolling Chinese gambler can open a line of credit backed by his
bank account. The gambler then proceeds deliberately to lose an
enormous amount of money in a glamorous game such as baccarat played
in an ostentatious VIP room. The gambling debt is promptly paid by
debiting the gambler’s bank account in China. This transfer is not
counted against the annual ceiling on capital exports because it is
viewed as payment of a legitimate debt. The “unlucky” gambler later
recovers the cash from the corrupt casino operator, minus a commission
for the money-laundering service rendered.

Even larger amounts are moved offshore through the mis-invoicing of
exports and imports. For example, a Chinese furniture manufacturer can
create a shell distribution company in a tax haven jurisdiction such
as Panama. Assuming the normal export price of each piece of furniture
is 200 dollars, the Chinese manufacturer can underinvoice the
Panamanian company and charge only 100 dollars for each piece. The
Panamanian company can then resell into normal distribution channels
for the usual price of 200 dollar per piece. The 100 dollar “profit”
per piece resulting from the underinvoicing is then left to accumulate
in Panama. With millions of furniture items shipped, the accumulated
phony profit in Panama can reach into the hundreds of millions of
dollars. This is money that would have ended up in China but for the
invoicing scheme.
