# Syria

[F]or a nation fighting a war on terrorism whose ideology and praxis
are mostly traced to the Middle East, it is arguably hardly possible
for United States to entertain a role in Syria not associated with
counterterrorism. Admittedly, the Obama administration has done
serious mistakes, chief among them calling on President Asad to step
down and creating a red line against the regime’s use of chemical
weapons. Eventually, the U.S. did not back its words with action. At
the same time, the U.S. relegated the political initiative to deal
with the Syrian crisis to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Whereas the first
fanned the ideological and monetary support for the jihadists, the
other paved for the Jihadists the route to Damascus. Yet, the U.S. has
struggled to support moderate opposition groups. As it turned out,
some of these groups have shifted their allegiance to al-Nusra Front
or other Salafi-Jihadist groups, which are dedicated to killing
Americans. In addition, can the moderate opposition be absolved of the
tragedy befalling Syria? When the U.S. designated al-Nusra Front as a
terrorist organization in November 2012, members of the Syrian
opposition deplored the American act, asserting the indispensability
of the al-Qaeda-affiliate group in fighting the Asad regime. This was
a serious strategic mistake that helped further legitimize
Salafi-jihadism within the Syrian revolution. Therefore, how could
anyone blame the U.S. for the rise of Salafi-jihadism in Syria? Did
the U.S. support, equip, train, or fund Salafi-jihadists? Did the
U.S. prefer supporting Jihadists more than the moderate opposition? In
fact, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait and UAE all supported
various Islamists and Jihadists significantly more than the moderate
opposition. No less significant, it is the Arab world, which applauded
and hailed the violent and oppressive Asad regime, that supported the
jihadists and helped bring Syria to its tragedy. Certainly, ISIS is
the latest manifestation of an Arab world mired in deep social and
political crisis.

Meanwhile, once the regime’s hold onto power had begun to teeter,
despite considerable support from Iran and Hezbollah, Russia stepped
in not only to save its old satellite capital but also to entrench
itself in the Mediterranean basin as a bulwark against what it
considers American hegemony. Strategically speaking, by helping the
Syrian regime, Moscow would create in Western Syria a bastion of
Iranian influence beholden to Russian power, while at the same time
turning the Eastern Mediterranean into a Russian lake. No doubt, the
entry of Moscow into the Syrian fay further complicated Washington’s
maneuvers. Whereas Moscow came to the help of an old client,
Washington has had reservations with certain predominant
Salafi-jihadist group spearheading the opposition. And, if history is
any guide, it is naïve to think that Russia would not pursue a
Grozny-like campaign to ensure that its military involvement in Syria
would not become ominously perpetual. This explains the forcible
displacement of Sunnis from parts of Western Syria and the savagery
with which Russia and its allies have pursued their campaign to seize
full control of Aleppo.

Consequently, Washington found itself in a quandary. It ironically
found itself on the same side with Russia and the Syrian regime
fighting Salafi-Jihadist opposition groups while at the same time
supporting the moderate opposition whose power paled in comparison to
the Jihadists.  Expectedly, neither the Obama Administration,
Congress, nor the US public support sending troops to an unfriendly
land crisscrossed by jihadists on one side, and Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, Hezbollah and Iraqi Mobilization units on the other. How could
one expect the U.S. to attack the regime, even in a limited capacity,
without potentially incurring the wrath and retaliation of its
Russian, Iranian, Hezbollah and Iraqi allies, all of which are really
running the deadly show? Similarly, should anyone expect that
Salafi-jihadists will not jump at the opportunity of Washington
striking at the regime to widen their sphere of influence and in the
process slaughter non-believers? Or should anyone brush aside the
possibility that the Iraqi mobilization units would use their
partnership with the Iraqi government to attack the approximately 6000
American soldiers advising the same government? Or should American
people forget the high pitched fictitious slogan that Iraqis would
welcome Americans with flowers as liberators in 2003? Certainly, the
U.S. is in an unenviable position in both Syria and Iraq, where
American enemies vastly outnumber American friends! Nevertheless, The
U.S. has been the largest donor of humanitarian aid for Syrian
refugees, and has sent dozens of U.S. troops to train and equip
moderate Syrian opposition forces.

Speaking recently before the UN General Assembly, the UN Secretary
General Ban Ki Moon drew a bleak but accurate picture of the Syrian
crisis: “Present in this hall today are representatives of governments
that have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in or even
planned and carried out atrocities inflicted by all sides of the Syria
conflict against Syrian civilians…Many groups have killed innocent
civilians — none more so than the government of Syria, which continues
to barrel bomb neighborhoods and systematically torture thousands of
detainees.”

This is the tragedy of Syria and, by extension, the tragedy of the
Muslim world in the Middle East. Be that as it may, the U.S. should
apply its soft influence to reach a permanent cease fire and end the
slaughter and displacement of Syrians. No doubt dealing with Russia is
exhausting and at times unproductive. But the reality of the world
today is that the U.S. cannot force a cease fire as part of a
settlement on its own without introducing a massive number of troops
to eventually occupy Syria.  In his most recent book World Order,
Henry Kissinger affirms that the main challenge for the twenty-first
century is how to shape an international order in a world buffeted by
violent conflicts, technological proliferation and radicalism. He adds
that unless the major powers reach a new kind of accommodation about
their global roles chaos would ensue. In other words, the United
States would find it difficult to play the leadership role it had
carried out in post-Cold War. Consequently, the United States
confronts a paradox whereby it continues to be the undisputed global
leader but in an often contested, sometimes uncertain global
position. This is the international backdrop against which the tragedy
in Syria continues to unfold [..].

Currently, the tragic reality today is that Aleppo is all but a
foregone conclusion, for the city is essential to consolidate
Russian-Iranian-Syrian regime control over Western Syria. It’s clear
from Secretary Kerry’s statements that the U.S. will not go to war
with Russia over Aleppo. But that does not mean that the U.S. and the
international community should not apply significant pressure,
including by proxy, on Russia and the Syrian regime to stop their
indiscriminate warfare. This begs the essential question following the
day after the likely fall of Aleppo: How to change the dynamics in
Syria in favor of the moderate opposition without creating a bigger
war and tragedy. Until a new American administration moves into the
White House, this remains to be seen!
