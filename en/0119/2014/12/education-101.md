# Education 101

Access to a world of infinite information has changed how we
communicate, process information, and think. Decentralized systems
have proven to be more productive and agile than rigid, top-down
ones. Innovation, creativity, and independent thinking are
increasingly crucial to the [digital] economy.

And yet the dominant model of public education is still fundamentally
rooted in the industrial revolution that spawned it, when workplaces
valued punctuality, regularity, attention, and silence above all
else. (In 1899, William T. Harris, the US commissioner of education,
celebrated the fact that US schools had developed the “appearance of a
machine,” one that teaches the student “to behave in an orderly
manner, to stay in his own place, and not get in the way of others.”)
We don’t openly profess those values nowadays, but our educational
system—which routinely tests kids on their ability to recall
information and demonstrate mastery of a narrow set of skills—doubles
down on the view that students are material to be processed,
programmed, and quality-tested. School administrators prepare
curriculum standards and “pacing guides” that tell teachers what to
teach each day. Legions of managers supervise everything that happens
in the classroom; in 2010 only 50 percent of public school staff
members in the US were teachers.

The results speak for themselves: Hundreds of thousands of kids drop
out of public high school every year. Of those who do graduate from
high school, almost a third are “not prepared academically for
first-year college courses,” according to a 2013 report from the
testing service ACT [..]

That’s why a new breed of educators, inspired by everything from the
Internet to evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and AI, are
inventing radical new ways for children to learn, grow, and thrive. To
them, knowledge isn’t a commodity that’s delivered from teacher to
student but something that emerges from the students’ own
curiosity-fueled exploration. Teachers provide prompts, not answers,
and then they step aside so students can teach themselves and one
another. They are creating ways for children to discover their
passion—and uncovering a generation of geniuses in the process.

In 1999, Sugata Mitra was chief scientist at a company in New Delhi
that trains software developers. His office was on the edge of a slum,
and on a hunch one day, he decided to put a computer into a nook in a
wall separating his building from the slum. He was curious to see what
the kids would do, particularly if he said nothing. He simply powered
the computer on and watched from a distance. To his surprise, the
children quickly figured out how to use the machine.

Over the years, Mitra got more ambitious. For a study published in
2010, he loaded a computer with molecular biology materials and set it
up in Kalikuppam, a village in southern India. He selected a small
group of 10- to 14-year-olds and told them there was some interesting
stuff on the computer, and might they take a look? Then he applied his
new pedagogical method: He said no more and left.

Over the next 75 days, the children worked out how to use the computer
and began to learn. When Mitra returned, he administered a written
test on molecular biology. The kids answered about one in four
questions correctly. After another 75 days, with the encouragement of
a friendly local, they were getting every other question right. “If
you put a computer in front of children and remove all other adult
restrictions, they will self-organize around it,” Mitra says, “like
bees around a flower.” [..]

Mitra [is] now in the process of establishing seven [schools], five in
India and two in the UK. In India, most of his schools are single-room
buildings. There will be no teachers, curriculum, or separation into
age groups—just six or so computers and a woman to look after the
kids’ safety. His defining principle: “The children are completely in
charge.”.

Mitra argues that the information revolution has enabled a style of
learning that wasn’t possible before.  The exterior of his schools
will be mostly glass, so outsiders can peer in. Inside, students will
gather in groups around computers and research topics that interest
them [..].

Mitra’s work has roots in educational practices dating back to
Socrates. Theorists from Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi to Jean Piaget and
Maria Montessori have argued that students should learn by playing and
following their curiosity. Einstein spent a year at a
Pestalozzi-inspired school in the mid-1890s, and he later credited it
with giving him the freedom to begin his first thought experiments on
the theory of relativity. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin
similarly claim that their Montessori schooling imbued them with a
spirit of independence and creativity [..]

Evolutionary psychologists have also begun exploring this way of
thinking. Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College who
studies children’s natural ways of learning, argues that human
cognitive machinery is fundamentally incompatible with conventional
schooling. Gray points out that young children, motivated by curiosity
and playfulness, teach themselves a tremendous amount about the
world. And yet when they reach school age, we supplant that innate
drive to learn with an imposed curriculum. “We’re teaching the child
that his questions don’t matter, that what matters are the questions
of the curriculum. That’s just not the way natural selection designed
us to learn. It designed us to solve problems and figure things out
that are part of our real lives.”

Some school systems have begun to adapt to this new philosophy—with
outsize results. In the 1990s, Finland pared the country’s elementary
math curriculum from about 25 pages to four, reduced the school day by
an hour, and focused on independence and active learning. By 2003,
Finnish students had climbed from the lower rungs of international
performance rankings to first place among developed nations [..]

For Juárez Correa [in Mexico] it was simultaneously thrilling and a
bit scary. In Finland, teachers underwent years of training to learn
how to orchestrate this new style of learning; he was winging it. He
began experimenting with different ways of posing open-ended questions
on subjects ranging from the volume of cubes to multiplying fractions
[..] Juárez Correa let the kids talk freely. It was a noisy, slightly
chaotic environment—exactly the opposite of the sort of
factory-friendly discipline that teachers were expected to impose. But
within 20 minutes, they had come up with the answer [..]

[H]e was even more intrigued by [one girl student named]
Paloma. During these experiments, he noticed that she almost always
came up with the answer immediately. Sometimes she explained things to
her tablemates, other times she kept the answer to herself. Nobody had
told him that she had an unusual gift. Yet even when he gave the class
difficult questions, she quickly jotted down the answers. To test her
limits, he challenged the class with a problem he was sure would stump
her. He told the story of Carl Friedrich Gauss, the famous German
mathematician, who was born in 1777.

When Gauss was a schoolboy, one of his teachers asked the class to add
up every number between 1 and 100. It was supposed to take an hour,
but Gauss had the answer almost instantly.

“Does anyone know how he did this?” Juárez Correa asked.

A few students started trying to add up the numbers and soon realized
it would take a long time. Paloma, working with her group, carefully
wrote out a few sequences and looked at them for a moment. Then she
raised her hand.

“The answer is 5,050,” she said. “There are 50 pairs of 101.”

Juárez Correa felt a chill. He’d never encountered a student with so
much innate ability. He squatted next to her and asked why she hadn’t
expressed much interest in math in the past, since she was clearly
good at it.

“Because no one made it this interesting,” she said.
