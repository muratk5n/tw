<h1>Keeping Score</h1>
<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/business/adam-nash-ceo-of-wealthfront-on-the-value-of-metrics.html</p>
<p>Clay Christensen was one of my advisers in business school at
Harvard. He’s known for “The Innovator’s Dilemma” and other insights
about strategy, but he also talked to us about management as an
ethical undertaking [..] his proposition to us was really about, “How
can you create an environment where you make people’s lives better in
that fundamental way?” It really stuck with me.</p>
<p>I think it’s a hard problem at multiple levels [..] In the software
industry, you’re used to dealing with very smart people. What they
really need out of leadership is very simple. They need to know the
game we’re playing and how to keep score.</p>
<p>The first one is about making sure everyone understands the company’s
core competency and how we’re going to beat competitors. Most leaders
get that right. But how you keep score is equally, if not more,
important. Because if you don’t give people metrics, smart people will
make up their own [..]</p>
<p>So if you have a company where everyone has their own ways of keeping
score, you’ll get incessant fighting and arguments, and they’re not
even arguing about what to do. They’re arguing about how to keep
score. They’re arguing about what game we’re really playing. That’s
all counterproductive.</p>
<p>Most people think that metrics are something you use to control
employees. I take the complete opposite view. I think metrics are
actually the way that you can harmonize a large number of people,
whether it’s dozens or even thousands, so that when they’re on their
own and making their own decisions, they can be empowered to make
those decisions, because they know they’re aligned with the rest of
the company.</p>
<p>I actually see that as a gift. People genuinely hate being
micromanaged. They hate being second-guessed. If you, as a leader, can
provide an environment where you can simply explain what your business
is about, and give them a handful of measures to know how to evaluate
things, all of a sudden hundreds of conversations will happen without
you, with people reaching decisions that are better than the decisions
that you would have come up with, because you don’t have their data
and their expertise. I think that’s a great gift that leaders give
their companies and organizations.</p>
<p>Everyone knows at Wealthfront that there are just a couple things that
we have to do to make this business successful. I’ve got it down to
two things — we have to acquire clients, and we have to delight
them. And there are four metrics that the whole company
tracks. They’re up on the wall, literally on a giant screen. And so
you hear people debating different ideas, and they’ll say: “Well,
wait, is this an idea to do A or is it to do B? How do we measure
that?”</p>
