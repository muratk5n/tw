# Let Them Sink

Clay Shirky

Nobody in their right mind believes the future of the news business
involves paper and ink rather than pixels on a screen. We all know
where the news business is headed, and what's more, we've known it for
at least a decade. So why on earth are people talking about a bailout
for newspapers? [..] It's like introducing legislation to save
horse-drawn carriages, or steam engines, or black-and-white TV. It's
stupid. It's pointless. It won't work.

The fact is, all this hysteria has nothing to do with saving the news,
or saving jobs. Nor is it about saving democracy, which is what the
red-in-the-face newspaper lovers always get themselves huffed about,
as if newspapers and democracy were inextricably linked. Democracy
existed long before newspapers did, and it will survive without
them. And plenty of countries that don't have democracy do have
newspapers. Nor would a bailout help readers. In fact, it would only
slow down our shift to the Internet, which is a far better medium for
delivering information.

The only beneficiaries of a bailout would be a handful of big
newspaper companies that used to be profitable and powerful and now,
well, aren't. Those companies saw the Internet charging toward them
like a freight train, and they just stood there on the tracks. They
didn't adapt. Why? Because for decades these companies enjoyed virtual
monopolies, and as often happens to monopolists, they got lazy. They
invested their resources in protecting their monopolies, using bully
tactics to keep new competitors from entering their markets. They
dished up an inferior product and failed to believe that anything or
anyone could ever take their little gold mines away from them.

It's hilarious to hear these folks puff themselves up with talk about
being the Fourth Estate, performing some valuable public service for
readers—when in fact the real customer has always been the advertiser,
not the reader. That truth has been laid bare in recent years. As soon
as papers got desperate for cash, they dropped their "sacred
principles" as readily as a call girl sheds her clothes. Ads on the
front page? Reporters assigned to write sponsored content? No problem.

Now, new companies with names like Politico and Huffington Post and
The Daily Beast and Gawker are beating newspapers at their own
game. The new guys are faster, and often better. They're leading, with
newspapers chasing behind. If the old guys really want to retain their
chokehold on the news business, they should consider buying up the new
guys. Problem is, the old guys waited too long, and now they're too
broke to make acquisitions. Whoops.

Sure, nobody has yet figured out how to make loads of money delivering
news over the Internet. But that's partly because there are too many
old newspaper companies, stumbling around like zombies: creatures from
another century, clinging to their lame old business model, surviving
but not thriving—and sucking up money that Internet companies could
put to better use.

Instead of giving newspapers bailouts, we should be hastening their
demise. The weak papers need to die. The strong newspapers need to go
into bankruptcy and restructure their businesses with smaller staffs
and lower cost structures. Yes, it will be painful. But journalists
will find jobs—and they'll be working in a better, faster medium.

Meanwhile, all of us need to get over this pious notion about the
sanctity of the newspaper. I've been a journalist for 27 years, and I
love that romantic old notion of the newsroom as much as the next
guy. But I recently canceled my two morning papers—The New York Times
and The Wall Street Journal—because I got tired of carrying them from
the front porch to the recycling bin, sometimes without even looking
at them. Fact is, I only care about a tiny percentage of what those
papers publish, and I can read them on my computer or my iPhone. And I
can rely on blogs and Twitter to steer me to articles worth reading.

As for all the hand-wringing about the great "in-depth" information
that only a newspaper can provide, let's be honest: the typical daily
newspaper does a lousy job. It tries to provide a little bit of
everything—politics, sports, business, celebrity stuff—and as a result
it doesn't do anything particularly well. Ask anyone who's an expert
in anything—whether it's bicycle racing or brain surgery—what they
think when they read a newspaper article about their field. Chances
are they cringe, because the material is so dumbed-down, and because
it's so clear that whoever wrote the article has no real expertise on 
this topic.
