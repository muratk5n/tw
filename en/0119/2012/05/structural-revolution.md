# The Structural Revolution

[We] believe the core problems are structural, not cyclical. The
recession grew out of and exposed long-term flaws in the
economy. Fixing these structural problems should be the order of the
day, not papering over them with more debt.

There are several overlapping structural problems. First, there are
those surrounding [..] technological change. Hyperefficient [..]
companies need fewer workers. As a result, unemployment rises,
superstar salaries surge while lower-skilled wages stagnate, the
middle gets hollowed out and inequality grows.

Then there are the structural issues surrounding the decline in human
capital. The United States, once the world’s educational leader, is
falling back in the pack. Unemployment is high, but companies still
have trouble finding skilled workers.

Then there is political sclerosis. Over the decades, companies and
other entities have implanted a growing number of special-interest
deals into the tax and regulatory codes, making it harder for
politically unconnected, new competitors, making the economy less
dynamic.

These and other structural problems have retarded growth and wages for 
decades. Consumers tried to compensate by borrowing more. Politicians 
tried to compensate by reducing the tax bill, increasing deficit 
spending, ensuring easy credit for homebuyers and by helping workers 
shift out of the hypercompetitive, globalized part of the economy and 
into the less productive and more sheltered parts of the economy — 
mostly into health care, government and education. 

But you can only mask structural problems for so long. The whole thing 
has gone kablooey. The current model, in which we try to compensate for 
structural economic weakness with tax cuts and an unsustainable welfare 
state, simply cannot last. The old model is broken. The jig is up. 

Unlike the cyclicalists, we structuralists do not believe that the
level of government spending is the main factor in determining how
fast an economy grows. If that were true, then Greece, Britain and
France would have the best economies on earth [..].

Running up huge deficits without fixing the underlying structure will
not restore growth. As Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago
writes in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, “Since the growth
before the crisis was distorted in fundamental ways, it is hard to
imagine that governments could restore demand quickly — or that doing
so would be enough to get the global economy back on track.  The
status quo ante is not a good place to return to because bloated
finance, residential construction and government sectors need to
shrink, and workers need to move to more productive work.” 

Structuralists face a tension: How much should you reduce the pain the 
unemployed are feeling now, and how much should you devote your 
resources to long-term reform? There has to be balance. For my taste, 
the Germans are a bit too willing to impose short-term pain on the 
diverse national economies in Europe. But they are absolutely right to 
insist on the sort of structural reforms they themselves passed in the 
1990s.

In the United States, there are almost no politicians willing to
embrace the cyclicalist agenda, which would mean much larger deficits.
Structuralists don’t have a perfect champion either. President Obama
is too minimalist. He doesn’t seem to believe America’s structural
problems are that big, making his reform ideas small.
