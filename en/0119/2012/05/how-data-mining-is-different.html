<h1>How Data Mining is Different</h1>
<p>Much of the important scientific and technological development of the
last four hundred years comes from a style of investigation, probably
best described by Karl Popper, based on controlled
experiments. Researchers construct hypotheses inductively, but usually
guided by anomalies in existig explanations of ‘how things work’. Such
hypotheses should have more explanatory power than existing theories,
and should be easier to falsify. Suppose a new hypothesis predicts
that cause A is responsible for effect B. A controlled experiment sets
up two situations, one in which cause A is present and the other in
which it is not. The two situations are, as far as possible, matched
with respect to all of the other variables that might influence the
presence or absence of effect B. The experiment then looks at whether
effect B is present only in the first situation.</p>
<p>Of course, few dependencies of effect on cause are perfect, so we
might expect that effect B is not present in some situations where
cause A is present, and vice versa. A great deal of statistical
machinery has been developed to help determine how much discrepancy
can exist and still be appropriate to conclude that there is a
dependency of effect B on cause A. If an experiment fails to falsify a
hypothesis then this adds credibility to the hypothesis, which may
eventually be promoted to a theory. Theories are not considered to be
ground truth, but only approximations with useful predictiveness. This
approach to understanding the universe has been enormously successful.</p>
<p>However, it is limited by the fact that there are four kinds of
settings where controlled experiments are not directly possible:</p>
<p>1) We do not have access to the variables that we would like to
control. Controlled experiments are only possible on earth or its near
vicinity. Understanding the wider universe cannot, at present, be
achieved by controlled experiments because we cannot control the
position, interactions and outputs of stars, galaxies, and other
celestial objects. We can observe such objects, but we have no way to
set them up in an experimental configuration.    2) We do not know how
to set the values of variables that we wish to control. Some processes
are not well enough understood for us to create experimental
configurations on demand. For example, fluid flowing next to a
boundary will occasionally throw off turbulent eddies. However, it is
not known how to make this happen. Studying the structure of such
eddies requires waiting for them to happen, rather than making them
happen.</p>
<p>3) It would be unethical to set some variables to some
values. Controlled medical experiments on human subjects can only take
place if the expected differences between the control and treatment
groups are small. If the treatment turns out to be either surprisingly
effective or dangerously ineffective, the experiment must be halted on
ethical grounds.     4) The values of some variables come from the
autonomous actions of humans. Controlled experiments in social,
political, and economic settings cannot be constructed because the
participants act in their own interests, regardless of the desires of
the experimenters. Governments and bureaucrats have tried to avoid
these limitations by trying to compel the ‘right’ behavior by
participants, but this has been notably unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Controlled experiments require very precise collection of data,
capturing the presence or absence of a supposed cause and the
corresponding effect, with all other variable values or attributes
either held constant, or matched between the two possibilities. In
situations where controlled experiments are not possible, such
different configurations cannot be created to order, but they may
nevertheless be present in data collected about the system of
interest. For  example, even though we cannot make stars behave in
certain ways, we may be able to find two situations where the presence
and absence of a hypothesized cause can be distinguished. The data
from such situations can be analyzed to see whether the expected
relationship between cause and effect is supported. These are called
natural experiments, in contrast to controlled experiments.</p>
<p>In natural experiments, it may often be more difficult to make sure
that the values of other variables or attributes are properly matched,
but this can be compensated for, to some extent, by the availability
of a larger amount of data than could be collected in a controlled
experiment. More sophisticated methods for arguing that dependencies
imply causality are also needed.</p>
<p>Data mining provides techniques for this second kind of analysis, of
systems too complex or inaccessible for controlled experiments.</p>
