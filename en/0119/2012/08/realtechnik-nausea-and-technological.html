<h1>Realtechnik, Nausea and Technological Longing</h1>
<p>The story of barbed wire is one of the most instructive ones in the
history of technology.  The short version is this: barbed wire
(developed between 1860 to 1873) helped close the American frontier,
carved out the killing fields of World War I, and by spurring the
development of the tank as a counter-weapon, created industrial-era
land warfare. It also ended the age-old global conflict between
pastoral nomads and settled agriculturalists (of animals, vegetables
and minerals) and handed a decisive victory to the latter. Cowboys and
Indians alike were on the wrong side of the barbed wire fence. Quite a
record for a technology that had little deep science or engineering
behind it.</p>
<p>Barbed wire is an example of a proximal-cause technology that
eventually disturbed multiple human balances of powers, starting with
the much-mythologized cowboys-versus-ranchers balance. When things
finally stabilized, a new technological world order had emerged,
organizing everything from butter to guns differently.  Barbed wire
was not a disruptive innovation in the Clayton Christensen sense. It
was something far bigger. Its introduction marked what Marshall
McLuhan called a break boundary in technological evolution: a rapid,
irreversible and wholesale undermining of a prevailing planet-wide
technological equilibrium. So ironically, the ultimate boundary-maker
of physical geography was a boundary breaker in technology history.</p>
<p>The story of barbed wire illustrates the core principle that I want to
propose: an equilibrium in technological affairs is necessary for an
equilibrium in political affairs. There is no possibility of
a realpolitik equilibrium without a
corresponding realtechnik equilibrium: a prevailing, delicately
balanced configuration of technological forces across an entire
connected political-economic-cultural space (which today is always the
entire planet).</p>
