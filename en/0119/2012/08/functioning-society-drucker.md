# A Functioning Society

Peter Drucker

### Status, Legitimacy

No society can function as a society unless it gives the individual
member social status and function, and unless the decisive social
power is legitimate power [..]

Social status and function of the individual is the equation of the
relationship between the group and the individual member. It
symbolizes the integration of the individual with the group, and that
of the group with the individual. It expresses the individual purpose
in terms of the society, and the social purpose in terms of the
individual. It thus makes comprehensible and rational individual
existence from the point of the group, and group existence from that
of the individual [..] Lack of social status and function, and absence
of a functional relationship between society and individual are at the
bottom of every persecution of minorities which either are without
social status and function—that is, not integrated into society [..]

[L]egitimate power can be defined as rulership which finds its
justification in the basic ethos of the society. In every society
there are many powers which have nothing to do with such a basic
principle, and institutions which in no way are either designed or
devoted to its fulfillment. In other words, there are always a great
many “unfree” institutions in a free society, a great many
inequalities in an equal society, and a great many sinners among the
saints. But as long as that decisive social power which we call
rulership is based upon the claim of freedom, equality or saintliness,
and is exercised through institutions which are designed toward the
fulfillment of these ideal purposes, society can function as a free,
equal or saintly society. For its institutional structure is one of
legitimate power.

This does not mean that it is immaterial whether non-decisive powers
and institutions of a society are in contradiction to its basic
principles. On the contrary, the most serious problems of politics
arise from such conflicts. And a society may well feel that a
nondecisive institution or power relationship is in such blatant
contrast to its basic beliefs as to endanger social life in spite of
its nondecisive character. The best case in point is that of the
American Civil War when the chattel-slavery of the South was felt to
endanger the whole structure of a free society. Yet the decisive power
of antebellum America was undoubtedly legitimate power deriving its
claim from the principle of freedom, and exercised through
institutions designed and devoted to the realization of
freedom. American society did thus function as a free society. It was
indeed only because it functioned as such that it felt slavery as a
threat.

What is the decisive power, and the decisive institutional
organization in any society cannot be determined by statistical
analysis. Nothing could be more futile than to measure a society by
counting noses, quoting tax receipts or comparing income
levels. Decisive is a political, and that means a purely qualitative,
term. The English landed gentry comprised never more than a small
fraction of the population; furthermore, after the rise of the
merchants and manufacturers it had only a very modest share of the
national wealth and income. Nevertheless, down to our times it held
the decisive social power. Its institutions were the decisive
institutions of English society.  [..]. Equally, laws and
constitutions will rarely, if ever, tell us where the decisive power
lies. In other words, rulership is not identical with political
government. Rulership is a social, political government largely a
legal category.

[One] example is that of British “indirect rule” in certain African
colonies. There the socially decisive power is within the tribes. At
least in theory the government of the white man wields no social power
at all; it confines itself to mere police matters designed to support
and to maintain the social organization of the tribes within a loose
and purely normative framework of “law and order.” Yet,
constitutionally, the governor and his council have absolute power.

Finally, it should be understood that legitimacy is a purely
functional concept. There is no absolute legitimacy. Power can be
legitimate only in relation to a basic social belief. What constitutes
“legitimacy” is a question that must be answered in terms of a given
society and its given political beliefs. Legitimate is a power when it
is justified by an ethical or metaphysical principle that has been
accepted by the society. Whether this principle is good or bad
ethically, true or false metaphysically, has nothing to do with
legitimacy, which is as indifferent ethically and metaphysically as
any other formal criterion. Legitimate power is socially functioning
power; but why it functions and to what purpose is a question entirely
outside and before legitimacy.

Failure to understand this was responsible for the confusion which
made “legitimism” the name of a political creed in the
early-nineteenth century. The European reactionaries of 1815 were, of
course, absolutely within their rights when they taught that no
society could be good except under an absolute monarch; to have an
opinion on what is desirable or just as basis of a society is not only
a right, it is a duty, of man. But they were simply confusing ethical
choice with functional analysis, when they said that no society could
function unless it had an absolute monarch. And they were provably
wrong when they proclaimed the dogma that only absolute monarchy was
legitimate. Actually, after the Napoleonic Wars, absolute monarchy was
illegitimate in Europe; the dynastic principle had ceased to be a
legitimate claim to decisive power. The revolutionary half century
before 1815 had resulted in a change in basic beliefs which made
illegitimate any but constitutionally limited government. This change
may have been desirable or deplorable; but it was a fact. The
Legitimists might have tried to make undone this change in
beliefs. They might have maintained that it would be better for the
individual and for society to have an illegitimate absolute rule than
a legitimate constitutional one. Or they might have invoked a “right
of resistance,” of secession or of revolution. The only basis on which
their claim could not be based politically was that of legitimacy.

Illegitimate power is a power which does not derive its claim from the
basic beliefs of the society. Accordingly, there is no possibility to
decide whether the ruler wielding the power is exercising it in
conformity with the purpose of power or not; for there is no social
purpose. Illegitimate power cannot be controlled; it is by its nature
uncontrollable. It cannot be made responsible since there is no
criterion of responsibility, no socially accepted final authority for
its justification. And what is unjustifiable cannot be responsible.

No illegitimate ruler can possibly be a good or wise
ruler. Illegitimate power invariable corrupts; for it can be only
“might,” never authority. It cannot be a controlled, limited,
responsible, or rationally determinable power. And it has been an
axiom of politics—ever since Tacitus in his history of the Roman
emperors gave us one case study after another—that no human being,
however good, wise or judicious, can wield uncontrolled,
irresponsible, unlimited or rationally not determinable power without
becoming very soon arbitrary, cruel, inhuman and capricious—in other
words, a tyrant.

For all these reasons a society in which the socially decisive power
is illegitimate power cannot function as a society. It can only be
held together by sheer brute force—tyranny, slavery, civil war. Of
course, force is the ultimate safeguard of every power; but in a
functioning society it is not more than a desperate remedy for
exceptional and rare diseases. In a functioning society power is
exercised as authority, and authority is the rule of right over
might. But only a legitimate power can have authority and can expect
and command that social self-discipline which alone makes organized
institutional life possible. Illegitimate power, even if wielded by
the best and the wisest, can never depend upon anything but the
submission to force. On that basis a functioning, institutional
organization of social life cannot be built. Even the best tyrant is
still a tyrant.
