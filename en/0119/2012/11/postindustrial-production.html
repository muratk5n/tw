<h1>Post-industrial Production</h1>
<p>As anyone who rides Amtrak between New York and Washington knows, the
trip can be a dissonant experience [..] The weirdness [..] is hardly
acknowledged anymore, because we’ve all had a few decades to get used
to it. But for most of the 180 or so years of the train line’s
existence, the endpoints of this journey — New York and D.C. — were
subordinate to the roaring engines of productivity in between. The
real value in America was created in [these regions].</p>
<p>This model was flipped inside out as Wall Street and D.C. became
central drivers, not secondary supports, of the nation’s economy. Now,
on its route between them, the train passes directly through or near 8
of the 10 richest counties in the United States, but all of this
wealth is concentrated near the endpoints of the journey [..]</p>
<p>Why? For the past 30-plus years, through Republican and Democratic
administrations, there has been much lip service paid to the idea that
the era of big government is over. Long live free enterprise. And yet
in the case of those areas surrounding the capital, wealth has
gravitated to the exact spot where government regulation is
created. Why? Because many businesses discovered that renegotiating
the terms between government and the private sector can be
extraordinarily lucrative [..] Wilmington, Del., has become wildly
successful as the place where Wall Street and D.C. meet. In 1981,
Gov. Pierre S. du Pont[..]  pushed through the Financial Center
Development Act, which led to the state’s new economic engine:
regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>[But there are now new kinds of automated  industrial production in
the in-between regions]</p>
<p>There are some workers [in these factories] — there to make sure the
machines keep running — but not many. These jobs, which go to people
with advanced, post-high-school training, typically offer a
good-enough wage to afford a house in the suburbs, far from the
industrial zones that hug the rail line. The people who do make their
lives right next to these factories — in Elizabeth, N.J., or Chester,
Pa., say — generally can’t afford the technical schooling that would
qualify them for jobs inside [..] The Boeing plant making Chinook
helicopters outside Philly, the Johnson &amp; Johnson campus in New
Brunswick [..] — they all tell the same story: a handful of highly
trained workers guiding machines that return huge value to
shareholders while all the time finding ways to produce more goods
with fewer workers [..]</p>
<p>But one more look out the Amtrak window reveals something else: the
shiny new buildings that are actually filled with workers have
nothing to do with manufacturing.  They’re in the broad service
sector, in the anonymous office centers that bloomed out of nowhere.</p>
