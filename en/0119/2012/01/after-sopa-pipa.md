# After SOPA, PIPA

Thankfully SOPA, PIPA is stopped, for now. Just to clear things up a
bit, the opponents of these bills are not against creators earning
what they rightfully deserve. The problem is not the copiers, the
problem is the half-baked nature of the system. On one hand it is very
easy to share content because of recent technology, on the other hand,
it is not easy for content creators to get the rewards (money) they
deserve. One part of the system is in 21st century, the other part is
on 19th.

Solution? We talked about this idea before; Let's say there is a Web
based registry for each artistic creation, and whenever people really
like a song, a book, a site, they go to this registry and "like" this
work. Or lookup the code for the creation, and send an SMS to a
well-known site. Each citizen gets a quota of "like points" each
month, day, or year. Unused likes gets carried over to the next
period.. or not. For starters I think two types, type A and type B are
needed [1]. Likes collected from others, if you were a creator
yourself, should be carried over IMO.

Where does the rubber meet the road? How can I feel the hard, cold
cash in my hands?

Options:

Government directs a portion of the tax revenue to back this like
based system.

Or, as an addition or replacement of today's "money = debt" system, we
can have "money = likes" system. Go to a bank, in return for your like
points, the bank prints money, and gives it to you. The amount of
money in the circulation will be proportional to the artistic,
scientific creation in that country.

Yes, people can try to abuse the system, creating circular like
chains, cliques. Fortunately cliques can be analyzed using software
(in computer science, CLIQUE is np-complete, it is a hard problem, but
not impossible given enough processing power). Or there will be
"report abuse" feature for people to self-police the system.

Given such a system, artists, scientists, inventors would scramble to
copy their creations to file sharing systems themselves, instead of
today's so-called "pirates".

We should not fight the current, we should learn to swim with it. The
urge to stick to a system will be strong, but it's obvious to everyone
with a shred of intelligence that the current system is
unworkable. There is a time when the most drastic change is also the
most pragmatic one.

Footnote

[1] Type A: Such points cannot be converted to cash, can only be given
out as either type, and are given to citizens either by government, or
non-profits. Type B: can be converted to cash, or can be given to as
either type to someone else. The difference between types is aimed to
discourage people to sit on their points. Type A is basically free
money, is only good for indicating an interest in someone else's work,
nothing else. On the receiving side, such points become convertible to
cash, as type B points, which is the reward an artist gets for her
work.

The creation of type A points by government (or others) can be the
cash -> point conversion part of the system, corresponding to a loan
payment after which the bank destroys the loan money.

[2] Some interesting ideas can be layered on top of the "like-points"
payment infrastructure. Suppose a scientific paper has a list of
citations at the end, and this paper gets 100 like points. The system
could easily provide a scheme where a portion of points received for
the paper is distributed to other papers in the citation list. So
everyone who contributed to the formation of an idea, research is
included in the payment.
