<h1>The Memristor</h1>
<p><img width="300"  src='../../mbl/2019/memristor.png'></p>
<p>Some call memristor "The Fourth Element" because after the widely
known elements resistor, capacitor, inductor, the memristor would be
the the fourth, and in a way, the missing element. Its founder
actually discovered it because he postulated <em>it had to be there</em>; the
first three are all results of various relations between voltage,
current, charge, flux; one relation and its circuit element was
missing - that turned out to be the memristor. And the last element
added is perhaps the most important one with far-reaching consequences
as it can point to the way nature <em>really</em> computes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cpmt.org/scv/meetings/chua.pdf">Theory</a> published in 1971,
manufactured 4 the first time in 2008. It's architecture is a
collection of differential equations! See <em>Dynamical Systems with
Applications using Python</em> by Lynch, pg. 65 for an intro on its
mathemamatics. You can apparently build computers with this
thing. Memory and processing on the same unit!</p>
<p>The area of research for memristors is named non-linear electronics.
In fact, triggering chaos in circuits is a test for presence of
memristors!  Apparently found in nature too.</p>

<p>Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080430/full/news.2008.789.html">article</a></p>
<p>The first programmable memristor chip,</p>
<p><a href="https://news.umich.edu/first-programmable-memristor-computer-aims-to-bring-ai-processing-down-from-the-cloud/">Link</a></p>
<p>(Because it's year 2019, the article goes on and on abt f--ing machine
learning, but u can read that as "scientific computation").</p>
<p>From what I read so far, it seems memristor allow analog computation,
not just binary. Here is another article talking abt how memristor can
model the brain in a better way, almost naturally.</p>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-12-brain-like-memristor-mimics-synapses.html">Link</a></p>
<p>"A new electronic device can developed at the University of Michigan can directly model the behaviors of a synapse, which is a connection between two neurons.</p>
<p>For the first time, the way that neurons share or compete for
resources can be explored in hardware without the need for complicated
circuits"</p>
<p>I always thought human brain is analog.</p>
<p>Maybe the entire von Neumann architecture will be overturned at some
point? VN arch talks about memory and processing as seperate units. </p>
<p>It's funny I kept thinking abt analog circuits and how they can
compute DE's (as they are modeled with DE's). And how our brains are
analog. This is the continuation of that thought; apparently we can
now create analog computers that can be faster and smaller. </p>
<p>Forget the transistor, hail the memristor!</p>
