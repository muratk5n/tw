<h1>E-Diesel</h1>
<p>They also call it <em>blue crude</em>. A company named Sunfire can generate a
synthetic crude using renewable sources which can be used in existing
diesel engines.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-diesel">Wikipedia</a>: "E-diesel is the
name of synthetic diesel created by Audi to be used in
automobiles. Currently, an e-diesel variant is created by Audi
research facility in partnership with a company named Sunfire. The
fuel is created from carbon dioxide, water, and electricity with a
process powered by renewable energy sources to create a liquid energy
carrier called blue crude (in contrast to regular crude oil) which is
then refined to generate e-diesel. E-diesel is considered to be a
carbon-neutral fuel as it does not extract new carbon and the energy
sources to drive the process are from carbon-neutral sources"</p>

<p>There is some buzz around Sunfire. They pulled in new money for
investment, it was in the

<p>Investing in (the right) clean tech can be quite profitable. </p>

<p>A portfolio consisting of tickers I could pull based on the list
above, <code>BLDP</code>, <code>ITM</code>, <code>PLUG</code>, <code>HYG</code>, <code>FCEL</code>, <code>SAND</code>, <code>HYSR</code> would have
generated over 30% return for the year 2018.</p>
