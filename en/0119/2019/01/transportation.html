<h1>Transportation Infrastructure, NH3</h1>

<p>To reiterate, cars can run longer range on same amt of fuel with H2
than gasoline.</p>
<p>Tank is filled in 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Hydrogen Fuel cell tech is already here.</p>
<p>H2 can be produced at gas stations. </p>
<p>If not, the fuel can be transported to stations in order to get the
benefits of scale. Transporting hydrogen was somewhat harder, but with
the CSIRO invention mentioned above H2 can simply be taken out of NH3,
on site. Where does the ammonia come from? Ammonia is already produced
in huge amounts in our economy, transported easily as liquid at room
temparature. We do need to make sure tho the production of ammonia is
green as well, but this is already <a href="../../2018/10/fracked-up.html">doable</a>.</p>
<p>All this sounds like a major slam-dunk. What remains is
enterpreneurial, policy push to implement it at scale. CSIRO probably
has a patent on the NH3/H2 seperation tech, a company perhaps
previously in gasoline business can to go into partnership with them
(patents suck, yes).</p>
<p>Countries with lots of sunshine, Australia, Saudi Arabia, can generate
and export ammonia.</p>
<p>Countries like Russia generate hydrogen and pipe it through the same
network used for natural gas. Britain has experiments
<a href="https://www.northerngasnetworks.co.uk/2018/11/29/hydrogen-to-heat-homes-14-9m-for-uks-first-trials-on-public-gas-network/">underway</a>
to use H2 as heating at homes.</p>
<p>Then, maybe, hopefully we dont frickin die in a few decades, air and
water is clean, no more wars to dig up some gunk from the soil.</p>
