# Whataboutism

Whataboutism is a propaganda technique formerly used by the Soviet
Union in its dealings with the Western world, and subsequently used as
a form of propaganda in post-Soviet Russia. When criticisms were
leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be "What
about..." followed by an event in the Western world.

The term whataboutery has been used in British English since the
period of The Troubles conflict in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers
date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s,
while other historians state that during the Cold War Western
officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term. The
tactic saw a resurgence in post-Soviet Russia, relating to human
rights violations committed by, and criticisms of, the Russian
government. The technique received new attention during Russia's 2014
annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Ukraine. Usage of
the tactic extended to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his
spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.

The Guardian deemed whataboutism, as used in Russia, "practically a
national ideology" [..] The New Yorker described the technique as "a
strategy of false moral equivalences". Jill Dougherty called
whataboutism a "sacred Russian tactic", and compared it to The pot
calling the kettle black.
