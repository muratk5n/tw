The Atlas of Economic Complexity - [PDF](https://oec.world/pdf/AtlasOfEconomicComplexity_Part_I.pdf)

The amount of knowledge that is required to make a product can vary
enormously from one good to the next. Most modern products require
more knowledge than what a single person can hold. [..] Accumulating
productive knowledge is difficult. For the most part, it is not
available in books or on the Internet. It is embedded in brains and
human networks. It is tacit and hard to transmit and acquire. It comes
from years of experience more than from years of schooling. Productive
knowledge, therefore, cannot be learned easily like a song or a
poem. It requires structural changes. Just like learning a language
requires changes in the structure of the brain, developing a new
industry requires changes in the patterns of interaction inside an
organization or society.[..]

*The Atlas of Economic Complexity* attempts to measure the amount of
productive knowledge that each country holds. Our measure of
productive knowledge can account for the enormous income differences
between the nations of the world and has the capacity to predict the
rate at which countries will grow. In fact, it is much more predictive
than other well-known development indicators, such as those that
attempt to measure competitiveness, governance and education.

Consider the case of Singapore and Pakistan. The population of
Pakistan is 34 times larger than that of Singapore. At market prices
their GDPs are similar since Singapore is 38 times richer than
Pakistan in per capita terms. Under the classification we use in this
Atlas, they both export a similar number of different products, about
133.

How can products tell us about the conspicuous differences in the
level of development that exist between these two countries?  Pakistan
exports products that are on average exported by 28 other countries
(placing Pakistan in the 60 th percentile of countries in terms of the
average ubiquity of their products), while Singapore exports products
that are exported on average by 17 other countries (1 st
percentile). Moreover, the products that Singapore exports are
exported by highly diversified countries, while those that Pakistan
exports are exported by poorly diversified countries. Our mathematical
approach exploits these second, third and higher order differences to
create measures that approximate the amount of productive knowledge
held in each of these countries"

For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor. As people
and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency
increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase
in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that
emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of
economic growth and development that gives a central role to the
complexity of a country’s economy by interpreting trade data as a
bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products
they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity
of a country’s economy by characterizing the structure of this
network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we
derive are correlated with a country’s level of income, and that
deviations from this relationship are predictive of future
growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of
income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures,
indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the
conditions that would allow complexity to emerge in order to generate
sustained growth and prosperity...

Now, if all countries are connected to each other through a global
market for inputs and outputs so that they can exploit a division of
labor at the global scale, why have differences in Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita exploded over the past two centuries? One
possible answer is that some of the individual activities that arise
from the division of labor described above cannot be imported, such as
property rights, regulation, infrastructure, specific labor skills,
etc., and so countries need to have them locally available in order to
produce. Hence, the productivity of a country resides in the diversity
of its available non-tradable capabilities, and therefore,
cross-country differences in income can be explained by differences in
economic complexity, as measured by the diversity of capabilities
present in a country and their interactions...

We can create indirect measures of the capabilities available in a
country by thinking of each one of these capabilities as a building
block or Lego piece. In this analogy, a product is equivalent to a
Lego model, and a country is equivalent to a bucket of
Legos. Countries will be able to make products for which they have all
the necessary capabilities, just like a child is able to produce a
Lego model if the child’s bucket contains all the necessary Lego
pieces. Using this analogy, the question of economic complexity is
equivalent to asking whether we can infer properties such as the
diversity and exclusivity of the Lego pieces inside a child’s bucket
by looking only at the models that a group of children, each with a
different bucket of Legos, can make. Here we show that this is
possible if we interpret data connecting countries to the products
they export as a bipartite network and assume that this network is the
result of a larger, tripartite network, connecting countries to the
capabilities they have and products to the capabilities they require
(Fig 1a). Hence, connections between countries and products signal the
availability of capabilities in a country just like the creation of a
model by a child signals the availability of a specific set of Lego
pieces.

Countries differ markedly in the diversification of their
exports. Products differ in the number of countries that export them,
which we define as their ubiquity. We document a new stylized fact in
the global pattern of exports: there is a systematic relationship
between the diversification of a country’s exports and the ubiquity of
its products. We argue that this fact is not implied by current
theories of international trade and show that it is not a trivial
consequence of the heterogeneity in the level of diversification of
countries or of the heterogeneity in the ubiquity of products. We
account for this stylized fact by constructing a simple model that
assumes that each product requires a potentially large number of
non-tradable inputs, which we call capabilities, and that a country
can only make the products for which it has all the requisite
capabilities. Products differ in the number and specific nature of the
capabilities they require, as countries differ in the number/nature of
capabilities they have.

Products that require more capabilities will be accessible to fewer
countries (i.e., will be less ubiquitous), while countries that have
more capabilities will have what is required to make more products
(i.e., will be more diversified). Our model implies that the return to
the accumulation of new capabilities increases exponentially with the
number of capabilities already available in a country. Moreover, we
find that the convexity of the increase in diversification associated
with the accumulation of a new capability increases when either the
total number of capabilities that exist in the world increases or the
average complexity of products, defined as the number of capabilities
products require, increases.

This convexity defines what we term as a quiescence trap, or a trap of
economic stasis: countries with few capabilities will have negligible
or no return to the accumulation of more capabilities, while at the
same time countries with many capabilities will experience large
returns - in terms of increased diversification - to the accumulation
of additional capabilities. We calibrate the model to three different
sets of empirical data and show that the derived functional forms
reproduce the empirically observed distributions of product ubiquity,
the relationship between the diversification of countries and the
average ubiquity of the products they export, and the distribution of
the probability that two products are co-exported. This calibration
suggests that the global economy is composed of a relatively large
number of capabilities – between 23 and 80, depending on the level of
disaggregation of the data – and that products require on average a
relatively large fraction of these capabilities in order to be
produced. The conclusion of this calibration is that the world exists
in a regime where the quiescence trap is strong.
