# Education Without Subjects

The head of the Department of [Finnish] Education in Helsinki, Marjo
Kyllonen, has announced that he believes that the way children are
taught now is based of a style that was a benefit to students in the
beginnings of the 1900s, but now is no longer relevant and beneficial
to our modernised way of learning. He strongly believes that our needs
have changed and so we need to adapt our teachings to match with our
new way of thinking and developing.

The huge changes will involve the removal of school subjects from the
curriculum, as proposed by Finnish officials, which will be replaced
by the study of individual events and phenomena.

This means that students will no longer have individual classes on
subjects such as maths, geography and history, but will instead study
an event, such as the Second World War, from the perspectives of
maths, geography and history [..].

The idea of this is to eliminate disengagement of students who have to
sit through individual classes that they believe they will not need
based on their future hopes and ambitions of a working future, but
instead will apply those prior individual subjects to a specific topic
of their choice, thereby still learning the same skills, but using
them in a more productive way that is most beneficial to their
individual learning.
