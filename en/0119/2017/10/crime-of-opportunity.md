# Crime of Opportunity

Five thousand seven hundred and forty children and teens died from
gunfire in the United States, just in 2008 and 2009. Twenty more,
including Olivia Engel, who was seven, and Jesse Lewis, who was six,
were killed just last week [..] The overwhelming majority of those
children would have been saved with effective gun control. We know
that this is so, because, in societies that have effective gun
control, children rarely, rarely, rarely die of gunshots. [..]

There are complex, hand-wringing-worthy problems in our social life:
deficits and debts and climate change. Gun violence, and the work of
eliminating gun massacres in schools and movie houses and the like, is
not one of them. Gun control works on gun violence as surely as
antibiotics do on bacterial infections. In Scotland, after Dunblane,
in Australia, after Tasmania, in Canada, after the Montreal
massacre—in each case the necessary laws were passed to make
gun-owning hard, and in each case… well, you will note the absence of
massacre-condolence speeches made by the Prime Ministers of Canada and
Australia, in comparison with our own President.

The laws differ from place to place. In some jurisdictions, like
Scotland, it is essentially impossible to own a gun; in others, like
Canada, it is merely very, very difficult. The precise legislation
that makes gun-owning hard in a certain sense doesn’t really
matter—and that should give hope to all of those who feel that, with
several hundred million guns in private hands, there’s no point in
trying to make America a gun-sane country.[..]

[T]he central insight of the modern study of criminal violence is that
all crime—even the horrific violent crimes of assault and rape—is at
some level opportunistic.

What the New York Police Department found out, through empirical
experience and better organization, was that making crime even a
little bit harder made it much, much rarer. [..]Those who hold
themselves together enough to be capable of killing anyone are subject
to the same rules of opportunity as sane people. Even madmen need
opportunities to display their madness, and behave in different ways
depending on the possibilities at hand. [..]

The more guns there are in a country, the more gun murders and
massacres of children there will be. Even within this gun-crazy
country, states with strong gun laws have fewer gun murders (and
suicides and accidental killings) than states without them.
