# UBI, Finland

Finland has become the first country in Europe to pay its unemployed
citizens an unconditional monthly sum, in a social experiment that
will be watched around the world amid gathering interest in the idea
of a universal basic income.

Under the two-year, nationwide pilot scheme, which began on 1 January,
2,000 unemployed Finns aged 25 to 58 will receive a guaranteed sum of
€560 (£475). The income will replace their existing social benefits
and will be paid even if they find work.

Kela, Finland’s social security body, said the trial aimed to cut red
tape, poverty and above all unemployment, which stands in the Nordic
country at 8.1%. The present system can discourage jobless people from
working since even low earnings trigger a big cut in benefits.

“For someone receiving a basic income, there are no repercussions if
they work a few days or a couple of weeks,” said Marjukka Turunen, of
Kela’s legal affairs unit. “Working and self-employment are worthwhile
no matter what.”

The government-backed scheme, which Kela hopes to expand in 2018, is
the first national trial of an idea that has been circulating among
economists and politicians ever since Thomas Paine proposed a basic
capital grant for individuals in 1797.

Attractive to the left because of its promise to lower poverty and to
the right – including, in Finland, the populist Finns party, part of
the ruling centre-right coalition – as a route to a leaner, less
bureaucratic welfare system, the concept is steadily gaining traction
as automation threatens jobs.
