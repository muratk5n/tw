# Red Packets

[Red Packets is] a feature WeChat introduced in 2014 to exchange money
electronically, based on the age-old Chinese custom of giving red
envelopes filled with money at weddings, holidays, and special
occasions. Mike said whenever people weren’t checking their messages
enough, the producer would send a red envelope to the group, and
everyone would go crazy. To me it sounded bizarre, the equivalent of
your boss tossing a fistful of change at your cubicle. The producer
would also send red envelopes as a reward to the cast and crew for
their hard work.[..]

Say you have a chat group with five pals. You can put $5 in a red
envelope and set it to disburse equally, so each friend gets
$1. Alternatively, you could stipulate that the first two people to
tap will get all the money in equal portions—$2.50 each—or that the
first two people get a random cut, maybe $1 for one person and $4 for
the other. The result is that any time a red envelope appears, people
scramble to tap on it as fast as possible. (The packets expire in a
day, adding to the time pressure.) Only afterwards do they see how
much money they’ve won, giving it an addictive element of surprise. So
addictive, in fact, that third-party apps now exist that let users
grab red envelopes without unlocking their phones [..]

WeChat introduced mobile pay in 2013, a year before its Red Packets,
but it’s the latter—with its seductive blend of social networking,
gaming, and gambling—that got users on board with the concept of
sending money electronically. Today, out of WeChat’s 700-plus million
active users, nearly 300 million have added their bank information to
WeChat Pay, enabling them to withdraw from and add money to their
virtual wallets. That’s contributed to the most bustling mobile
payments economy in the world: In 2015, China’s mobile transactions
surged to $235 billion, surpassing the U.S. for the first
time. According to iResearch, China’s mobile payments market is
estimated to be worth 15.7 trillion yuan in 2016—28 times the $62.5
billion forecast by eMarketer for the U.S. in 2017—and 28.5 trillion
yuan in 2018.
