<h1>Overbooked My Ass</h1>
<p>[There was w]idespread misreporting of the cause of the [United]
incident as “overbooking”. [..] Confirming this impression is that
that four Senators and Governor Chris Christie, when weighing in on
the incident, all referred to it as the result of overbooking or
overselling.</p>
<p>Overbooking is a capacity management practice of selling more tickets
for a particular flight than there are actual seats. Airlines do that
because they have sufficient experience with the level of no-shows and
late-in-the-game rebookings to not wind up with oversold flights all
that often.</p>
<p>In fact, as careful readers know, United wanted to free up four seats
so that crew members could fly to from O’Hare to Louisville. The
excuse for United’s urgency was that if these crew members didn’t get
to their flight, it would create cascading delays. Early accounts can
be excused for this error, since the initial tweets with the appalling
videos described the cause as overbooking. But any article published
more than 24 hours after the story broke has no excuse for getting
this basic and important detail wrong, particularly after United CEO
Oscar Munoz said the flight was indeed not overbooked. [..]</p>
<p>This seems to reflect the deep internalization in America of deference
to authority in the post 9/11 world, as well as reporters who appear
to be insufficiently inquisitive. And there also seems to be a
widespread perception that because it’s United’s plane, it can do what
it sees fit. In fact, airlines are regulated and United is also bound
to honor its own agreements. [.. Some comments by a lawyer]</p>
<p>"Lawyer here. This myth that passengers don’t have rights needs to go
away, ASAP. You are dead wrong when saying that United legally kicked
him off the plane.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s airline spin to call this an overbooking. The
statutory provision granting them the ability to deny boarding is
about “OVERSALES”, specifically defines as booking more reserved
confirmed seats than there are available. This is not what
happened. They did not overbook the flight; they had a fully booked
flight, and not only did everyone already have a reserved confirmed
seat, they were all sitting in them. The law allowing them to denying
boarding in the event of an oversale does not apply.</p>
<p>Even if it did apply, the law is unambiguously clear that airlines
have to give preference to everyone with reserved confirmed seats when
choosing to involuntarily deny boarding. They have to always choose
the solution that will affect the least amount of reserved confirmed
seats. This rule is straightforward, and United makes very clear in
their own contract of carriage that employees of their own or of other
carriers may be denied boarding without compensation because they do
not have reserved confirmed seats. On its face, it’s clear that what
they did was illegal– they gave preference to their employees over
people who had reserved confirmed seats, in violation of 14 CFR
250.2a.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if you try and twist this into a legal application
of 250.2a and say that United had the right to deny him boarding in
the event of an overbooking; they did NOT have the right to kick him
off the plane. Their contract of carriage highlights there is a
complete difference in rights after you’ve boarded and sat on the
plane, and Rule 21 goes over the specific scenarios where you could
get kicked off. NONE of them apply here. He did absolutely nothing
wrong and shouldn’t have been targeted. He’s going to leave with a
hefty settlement after this fiasco"</p>
