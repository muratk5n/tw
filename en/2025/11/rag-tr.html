<h1>TR Identity Summarized, via RAG</h1>
<p>The description of the nationality of a Turk, according to the
sources, involves understanding the distinction between the
constructed national narrative and the historical and cultural reality
of the people of Anatolia.</p>
<p>The Constructed Turkish National Narrative</p>
<p>The concept of a self-perceived 'Turkish nation' did not exist before
the nineteenth century. The notion of a 'Turkish state' as a home for
the 'Turkish nation' was radically and comprehensively implemented
following the founding of the Turkish Republic after 1923..</p>
<p>The foundation of this identity, known as the Turkist narrative, is
rooted in the dictates of nationalism, which often invents or
radically modifies the cultures it claims to defend and revive. This
national narrative intentionally framed specific events in the past to
highlight a glorious history.</p>
<p>Key elements of this narrative include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Central Asian Origins: The Turkish History Thesis contended that
  Turks were a great and ancient race that created a bright
  civilization in Central Asia. Due to climatic changes, they left
  their original home and moved in all directions, including to
  Anatolia, to civilize the rest of the world. This historical vision
  gives a prominent place to migration from Central Asia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ideal Turk: The founders of the Republic chose an identity that
  was "outside" the imploded Ottoman structures—the Turk from Central
  Asia, who was considered ideal and pure. This identity was initially
  constructed to be secular and sometimes shamanistic, to move away
  from the realm of Islam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Blended and Inconsistent Ideology: Following political upheavals,
  particularly the 1980 fascist coup, the identity was later changed
  to include religious aspects, making it a combination of secularism
  and Ottomanism, which the sources describe as a "weird potpourri of
  ideologies" and an example of fascism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclusion of Others: The national narrative requires homogeneity. It
  assumes Turks arrived in Anatolia, found the place empty, and
  remained unchanged, thus rejecting the history of pre-Turkish
  Anatolian migrations. For example, Kurds were labeled as "mountain
  Turks" who simply did not know their true identity, leading to
  decades of internal conflict and oppression.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This constructed identity led to the adoption of Turkified last names (like Ozturk, Turker, Erturk) following a 1930s law, often having martial or racist themes, which are considered a "sad reminder of a corrupted nationalization process".</p>
<p>Cultural and Historical Reality</p>
<p>In contrast to the nationalist narrative, the sources suggest that the
culture of the people of Anatolia is rooted in the region's long
history and geography.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assimilation and Genetic Makeup: Arrivals in Anatolia, including
  those referred to as "Turks" from Central Asia, assimilated into the
  larger culture they found. Genetic research indicates that only
  about 9% (with a confidence interval of 7-11%) of the genetic
  structure of today’s Anatolia is of Asiatic origin. The cultural
  effect of the migrants was minimal, proportional to their size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Culmination of Cultures: Today’s Anatolians are described as being
  culturally close to Greeks, Armenians, or Kurds, or as a culmination
  of all of them, including migrants, but in a small fashion. The
  region invented organized agriculture and carries the cultural
  baggage of having been centrally located within Roman and Byzantine
  (Rome II and III) and Ottoman governance, leading to a
  "peasant/palace dynamic" culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historical Connotation of the Name: Before the rise of nationalism,
  the word "Turk" often meant "Muslim" in the Balkans. However, in
  Anatolia, the word "Turk" was historically considered an ethnic
  slur. As recently as a century ago, Ottoman soldiers responded to
  the question "but aren’t we all Turks!?" with <em>estağfurullah</em>
  (meaning roughly "c'mon that cannot be!" or "do not sell yourself
  short"), indicating they considered the term derogatory when applied
  to themselves. This unfavorable meaning of the word persists even
  today among some well-educated citizens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the sources suggest that the nationality of a Turk is
defined by a modern, often inconsistent, nationalist narrative rooted
in distant Central Asian ancestry and constructed to serve political
purposes. However, the cultural and genetic reality of the people
living in Anatolia is primarily a culmination of millennia of
civilizations and populations within that geography, with minimal
demographic impact from the groups whose name was adopted for the
modern nation. This contradiction leads to pathologies in the
identity, such as the persistence of the term "Turk" as a slur despite
being the national designation.</p>
