<h1>Aether, Elastic Solid Theory by R. Close and S. Rashkovskiy</h1>
<p>Books on quantum mechanics often point out that the theory explains
phenomena that had not previously been explained by classical physics
[1]. This is true. But one should ask <em>why</em> classical physics failed
to explain these phenomena. Was it because classical models are
intrinsically ill‐suited to describing nature? Or was it because
realistic classical models were too complicated for physicists to
analyze?</p>
<p>The historical evidence points to the latter explanation. The earliest
conception of the aether consistent with the behavior of light waves
was Thomas Young’s observation that light seemed to behave like
transverse waves in an elastic solid.  This theory was successfully
applied to the study of light by a host of now‐famous 19th century
scientists, with contributions from Boussinesq, Cauchy, Fresnel,
Green, MacCullagh, Navier, Stokes, Rayleigh, Riemann, Thompson (Lord
Kelvin), and others (Maxwell used a more complicated aether model to
derive the equations of electromagnetism). Yet in spite of the elastic
solid’s conceptual simplicity, and the extensive effort spent
analyzing it, no exact description of its physical behavior could be
produced. The reason for this failure is the non‐Abelian nature of
finite rotations. Nineteenth‐century scientists did not have the
mathematical tools needed to describe arbitrary variations of
orientation, and even modern condensed matter theorists have shied
away from the attempt (Kleinert 1989).  Today, the mathematics of
rotations is well‐understood for quantum mechanical systems. This fact
makes it reasonable to suppose that rotations in classical elastic
solids might also be described by similar mathematics..</p>
<p>Are there photons in fact? There are two opposing points of view on
the nature of light: the first one manifests the wave-particle duality
as a fundamental property of the nature; the second one claims that
photons do not exist and the light is a continuous classical wave,
while the so-called “quantum” properties of this field appear only as
a result of its interaction with matter. In this paper we show that
many quantum phenomena which are traditionally described by quantum
electrodynamics can be described if light is considered within the
limits of classical electrodynamics without quantization of
radiation. These phenomena include the double-slit experiment, the
photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, the Hanbury Brown and Twiss
effect, the so-called multiphoton ionisation of atoms, etc. We show
that this point of view allows also explaining the “wave-particle
duality” of light in Wiener experiments with standing waves. We show
that the Born rule for light can easily be derived from Fermi’s golden
rule as an approximation for low-intense light or for short exposure
time. We show that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for “photons”
has a simple classical sense and cannot be considered as a fundamental
limitation of accuracy of simultaneous measurements of position and
momentum or time and energy. We conclude that the concept of a
“photon” is superfluous in explanation of light-matter interactions [2]..</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics without quanta.. In this paper, I argue that light
is a continuous classical electromagnetic wave, while the observed
so-called quantum nature of the interaction of light with matter is
connected to the discrete (atomic) structure of matter and to the
specific nature of the light-atom interaction.  From this point of
view, the Born rule for light is derived, and the double-slit
experiment is analysed in detail. I show that the double-slit
experiment can be explained without using the concept of a “photon”,
solely on the basis of classical electrodynamics. I show that within
this framework, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for a “photon”
has a simple physical meaning not related to the fundamental
limitations in accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of position
and momentum or time and energy. I argue also that we can avoid the
paradoxes connected with the wave-particle duality of the electron if
we consider some classical wave field - “an electron wave” - instead
of electrons as the particles and consider the wave equations (Dirac,
Klein-Gordon, Pauli and Schrödinger) as the field equations similar to
Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field. It is shown that such
an electron field must have an electric charge, an intrinsic angular
momentum and an intrinsic magnetic moment continuously distributed in
the space. It is shown that from this perspective, the double-slit
experiment for “electrons”, the Born rule, the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle and the Compton effect all have a simple explanation within
classical field theory. The proposed perspective allows consideration
of quantum mechanics not as a theory of particles but as a classical
field theory similar to Maxwell electrodynamics..</p>
<p>Here [3], I show that the double-slit experiment can be easily
explained in terms of classical electrodynamics if we take into
account the discrete structure of matter (a screen, a detector) and
the specific nature of the interaction of light with matter, which is
described by the Schrodinger equation (or other wave equation of
quantum mechanics)... The calculation proceeds using the Monte Carlo
method: at each time, the probability of excitation of each unexcited
(non-ionised) atom will be calculated. The calculation for each atom
is continued until its excitation (ionisation) occurs.. Comparing
Fig. 1 with the real picture of the “accumulation of photons” on the
photographic plate in the double-slit experiment, we see that the
calculated pattern is completely consistent with the experimental
interference pattern and the model completely reproduces the results
of these experiments..</p>

<p>Chantal Roth: Using simulations and classical field theory (inspired
by Maxwell, Kelvin, and recent work by Close and Rashkovskiy), I show
how familiar 'quantum' outcomes like spin-½ and Stern-Gerlach
splitting can arise from deterministic wave evolution. I also explore
the idea that gravity is a form of refraction and that space
contraction and time dilation are natural wave effects.</p>
<p>This ontological approach offers intuitive explanations, and may help
bridge the gap between quantum theory and general relativity..</p>
<p>In this model, both the Schrödinger equation and also the Dirac
equation have a real physical meaning, that is quantum physics has an
underlying reality and a wave function is not just a probability
density, but consists of actual deformations in an elastic solid – our
universe. This elastic solid can be thought of as the 'fabric of
space [5]</p>
