<h1>NATO/West Russia Timeline</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1992</p>
<ul>
<li>04/06: The Bosnian War, an international armed conflict that took
  place in Bosnia and Herzegovina starts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>1994</p>
<ul>
<li>12/01: Finland and Sweden join NATO’s Partnership for Peace program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>1995</p>
<ul>
<li>08/30: Month-long NATO bombing campaign against Serbian targets begins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>1996:</p>
<ul>
<li>02/15: Russian popular discontent becomes so intense that it is
  clear the incumbent president, Boris Yeltsin, had no chance of
  winning reelection. The Russian oligarchate are now concerned
  that victory by the communists might create difficulties for
  their continued looting of the country. A group of the most
  powerful oligarchs, led by Berezovsky and Gusinsky, make a deal
  with Yeltsin: in return for his guaranteeing the privatization
  of state enterprises, they finance his campaign and throw their
  media resources behind him—by that point, they controlled all
  mass media. They also hire a team of American political campaign
  consultants (including the infamous Dick Morris) to manage
  Yeltsin’s reelection. Even that would not be enough, and in the
  end they resort to massive electoral fraud to reelect
  Yeltsin. This is how Russia becomes an extreme plutocracy in 1996.
  The year is likely the lowest point in recent Russian
  history, people are dying in droves from deaths of despair.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>1997</p>
<ul>
<li>02/05: Famous strategist George F. Kennan writes “[B]luntly
  stated…expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of
  American policy in the entire post-Cold War era. Such a decision
  may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and
  militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse
  effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the
  atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel
  Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our
  liking”. Kennan is the architect of America’s post-World War II
  strategy of containment of the Soviet Union.</li>
