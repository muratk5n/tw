# NATO/West Russia Timeline

      place in Bosnia and Herzegovina starts.

* 1995

    * 08/30: Month-long NATO bombing campaign against Serbian targets begins.

* 1996:

    * 02/15: Russian popular discontent becomes so intense that it is
      clear the incumbent president, Boris Yeltsin, had no chance of
      winning reelection. The Russian oligarchate are now concerned
      that victory by the communists might create difficulties for
      their continued looting of the country. A group of the most
      powerful oligarchs, led by Berezovsky and Gusinsky, make a deal
      with Yeltsin: in return for his guaranteeing the privatization
      of state enterprises, they finance his campaign and throw their
      media resources behind him—by that point, they controlled all
      mass media. They also hire a team of American political campaign
      consultants (including the infamous Dick Morris) to manage
      Yeltsin’s reelection. Even that would not be enough, and in the
      end they resort to massive electoral fraud to reelect
      Yeltsin. This is how Russia becomes an extreme plutocracy in 1996.
      The year is likely the lowest point in recent Russian
      history, people are dying in droves from deaths of despair.

    * 02/05: Famous strategist George F. Kennan writes “[B]luntly
      stated…expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of
      American policy in the entire post-Cold War era. Such a decision
      may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and
      militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse
      effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the
      atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel
      Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our
      liking”. Kennan is the architect of America’s post-World War II
