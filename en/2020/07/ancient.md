# Ancient

When people praise a region, a country being "ancient", "had
civilization" what they mean is that region had contact with
agriculture the longest, because only then you can have a mafia
(empire) who can tax (peasant is tied to land, can't run away), raise
armies, kill others and build arenas, roads which later generations as
tourist can gape at like morons.

However, and in the light of agriculture being the root ill of many of
the later predicaments [as we now know](../../2017/12/rome.html), one
could guess countries who were at the center of these "ancient"
developments would clearly be worse off. And they are. The Han,
Ottocuck, Egypt, Sassanid, Rome... agro-centric centralized mafia
empires, through their peasant/tax/opress cycle created a toxic
culture that still lingers in these regions, like a bad fart, which is
impeding the progress of their descendants. Lets's look at data.

We compare China, Italy, so-called Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Iran vs
others.

GDP per capita, them vs others (data from World Bank, [GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita), [Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)),[CSV](gdpw.csv))


```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('gdpw.csv')
df['gdpw'] = df.gdpcap * df.population
anc = ['China','Italy','Turkey','Greece','Egypt','Iran']
dfc1 = df[df.country.isin(anc)]
dfc2 = df[df.country.isin(anc) == False ]
print ('Mafia', np.round(dfc1.gdpw.sum() / dfc1.population.sum(),2))
print ('Others', np.round(dfc2.gdpw.sum() / dfc2.population.sum(),2))
```

```text
Mafia 10069.93
Others 11739.59
```

Significant difference.
