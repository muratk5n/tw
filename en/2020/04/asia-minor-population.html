<h1>Population of Asia Minor</h1>
<p>Analysis using the Seshat data; We used the Equinox-2020 dataset from below,
local version <a href="seshat-row.zip">here</a></p>
<p>http://seshatdatabank.info/datasets/</p>
<p>The encoding of this dataset carries different attributes in seperate
rows, instead of columns, so preprocessing was necessary. We filter
out population and territory data for Asia Minor, adjust the
population for the current size of TR, ~800K sq meters. This way we
are always looking at the same area, no matter under which gov that
happened to b around, however big or small in that region.</p>

<p>The arrival of new ppl into Asia Minor (Anatolia) starting from 600s
and continuing for a few centuries seems to be around 1 million
arriving into a population of 8 million. These people came to settle,
not to battle (unlike Mongols later, who did). Once governance
structures formed, around them, including them, they would have
battled with Byzantium and also with eachother causing pop decreases,
but the real killers were the plaques, and later the Mongols who beat
the gov of the time, the Seljuks. On the Byzantine side the capital
city was sacked by Crusaders in 1204.</p>
<p>As an alternative source, data from <em>Demography, Part 1</em> by Vinogradov is also below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="pop-asia-minor.png" /></p>
<p>According to this source, AM population hovers mostly around 7
million, it was 8 million at 1025, 7.2 million on 1300, 7 million
1500...</p>
<p>Both datasets support a minority thesis, and since culture codes are
the important element, that are tied to geography, arrivals wld mostly
be assimilated and belong to their region. This is the reason why
today's Anatolians are close in culture to Greeks, Armenians, or
Kurds, or one cld say <em>are</em> a culmination of all of them, including of
course some migrants, in a small fashion. </p>
