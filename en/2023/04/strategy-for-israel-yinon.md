# A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties

Oded Yinon, 1982, [Original](https://www.voltairenet.org/article185957.html)

Egypt is divided and torn apart into many foci of authority. If Egypt
falls apart, countries like Libya, Sudan or even the more distant
states will not continue to exist in their present form and will join
the downfall and dissolution of Egypt. The vision of a Christian
Coptic State in Upper Egypt alongside a number of weak states with
very localized power and without a centralized government as to date,
is the key to a historical development which was only set back by the
peace agreement but which seems inevitable in the long run. 

The Western front, which on the surface appears more problematic, is
in fact less complicated than the Eastern front, in which most of the
events that make the headlines have been taking place
recently. Lebanon’s total dissolution into five provinces serves as a
precendent for the entire Arab world including Egypt, Syria, Iraq and
the Arabian peninsula and is already following that track. The
dissolution of Syria and Iraq later on into ethnically or religiously
unqiue areas such as in Lebanon, is Israel’s primary target on the
Eastern front in the long run, while the dissolution of the military
power of those states serves as the primary short term target. Syria
will fall apart, in accordance with its ethnic and religious
structure, into several states such as in present day Lebanon, so that
there will be a Shi’ite Alawi state along its coast, a Sunni state in
the Aleppo area, another Sunni state in Damascus hostile to its
northern neighbor, and the Druzes who will set up a state, maybe even
in our Golan, and certainly in the Hauran and in northern Jordan. This
state of affairs will be the guarantee for peace and security in the
area in the long run, and that aim is already within our reach
today. 

Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is
guaranteed as a candidate for Israel’s targets. Its dissolution is
even more important for us than that of Syria. Iraq is stronger than
Syria. In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the
greatest threat to Israel. An Iraqi-Iranian war will tear Iraq apart
and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a
struggle on a wide front against us. Every kind of inter-Arab
confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way
to the more important aim of breaking up Iraq into denominations as in
Syria and in Lebanon. In Iraq, a division into provinces along
ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is
possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major
cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi’ite areas in the south will
separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. It is possible that the
present Iranian-Iraqi confrontation will deepen this
polarization. 

The entire Arabian peninsula is a natural candidate for dissolution
due to internal and external pressures, and the matter is inevitable
especially in Saudi Arabia. Regardless of whether its economic might
based on oil remains intact or whether it is diminished in the long
run, the internal rifts and breakdowns are a clear and natural
development in light of the present political structure. 

Jordan constitutes an immediate strategic target in the short run but
not in the long run, for it does not constitute a real threat in the
long run after its dissolution, the termination of the lengthy rule of
King Hussein and the transfer of power to the Palestinians in the
short run.

There is no chance that Jordan will continue to exist in its present
structure for a long time, and Israel’s policy, both in war and in
peace, ought to be directed at the liquidation of Jordan under the
present regime and the transfer of power to the Palestinian
majority. Changing the regime east of the river will also cause the
termination of the problem of the territories densely populated with
Arabs west of the Jordan. Whether in war or under conditions of peace,
emigrationfrom the territories and economic demographic freeze in
them, are the guarantees for the coming change on both banks of the
river, and we ought to be active in order to accelerate this process
in the nearest future. The autonomy plan ought also to be rejected, as
well as any compromise or division of the territories for, given the
plans of the PLO and those of the Israeli Arabs themselves, the
Shefa’amr plan of September 1980, it is not possible to go on living
in this country in the present situation without separating the two
nations, the Arabs to Jordan and the Jews to the areas west of the
river. Genuine coexistence and peace will reign over the land only
when the Arabs understand that without Jewish rule between the Jordan
and the sea they will have neither existence nor security. A nation of
their own and security will be theirs only in Jordan. 

Within Israel the distinction between the areas of ’67 and the
territories beyond them, those of ’48, has always been meaningless for
Arabs and nowadays no longer has any significance for us. The problem
should be seen in its entirety without any divisions as of ’67. It
should be clear, under any future political situation or mifitary
constellation, that the solution of the problem of the indigenous
Arabs will come only when they recognize the existence of Israel in
secure borders up to the Jordan river and beyond it, as our
existential need in this difficult epoch, the nuclear epoch which we
shall soon enter. It is no longer possible to live with three fourths
of the Jewish population on the dense shoreline which is so dangerous
in a nuclear epoch.

Dispersal of the population is therefore a domestic strategic aim of
the highest order; otherwise, we shall cease to exist within any
borders. Judea, Samaria and the Galilee are our sole guarantee for
national existence, and if we do not become the majority in the
mountain areas, we shall not rule in the country and we shall be like
the Crusaders, who lost this country which was not theirs anyhow, and
in which they were foreigners to begin with. Rebalancing the country
demographically, strategically and economically is the highest and
most central aim today. Taking hold of the mountain watershed from
Beersheba to the Upper Galilee is the national aim generated by the
major strategic consideration which is settling the mountainous part
of the country that is empty of Jews today.
