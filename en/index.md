Anwaj: "The US is threatening severe consequences if Nouri Al-Maliki
returns as Iraq’s prime minister.. Reuters reported that US Special
Envoy to Iraq Mark Savaya had been sidelined, with his portfolio set
to be managed by US Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy to Syria
Thomas Barrack.

Although US officials have not made any formal announcement, Iraqi
Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein has said that Savaya is no longer an
envoy. Iraqi political sources have attributed Savaya’s departure to
his purported "mishandling" of sensitive issues, including Maliki’s
nomination. One political observer has noted that 'Barrack has
effectively been in charge' of the Iraq portfolio for weeks.
