I thought markets were a good thing.. their mere presence caused roses
to bloom, cows to fly. Binness solves everything.

Wiki: "Ritchie is a vocal supporter of the U.S. Republican Party and
holds libertarian views."

It sounds like KR is calling for more **government** and for more
**regulation**.

ABC News: "Kid Rock, legally named Robert Ritchie, testified before
Congress on Wednesday in which he expressed his concerns over the
secondary ticket market driving up costs for consumers... [he also]
claimed that promises made by Ticketmaster CEO and Live Nation CEO to
ensure that ticket prices stay cheap following their merger failed to
be kept..

He then went on and called on Congress to open a formal investigation
and subpoena the contracts and deals between 'artists / promoters /
buildings / ticketing companies / agencies and vendors,' asserting
they will uncover 'mountains of fraud and abuse.'

'It’s no secret this industry is full of greedy snakes and
scoundrels,' Kid Rock said. 'Too many suits lining their pockets off
talent they never had and fans they mislead.'"

I wish "AI" could help here, but they are trained on the output of the
same spaz, so they become spaz. The other day I rehashed one earlier
argument with an LLM after a few convos built on top of it, and LLM
*lost* it. It had a complete meltdown.

How come the massive zero-point energy does not effect gravity
(question from yesterday's post). Nassim Haramein would say that
energy "turns on itself" and gravitational effect is what leaks on the
outside world... I will not use the "b-word", reader can check out the
rest.
