F24: "Britain on Tuesday unveiled its first national plan to curb
'forever chemicals,' seeking to cut risks to human health and the
environment, the government said. PFAS, used in products from cookware
to food packaging, persist for decades and accumulate in nature,
posing threats likely to endure for hundreds of years."

I love it.. Mandelson is a "New Labour" guy, one of those Clintonite
Brits, economic right social left type "progressive". We can enjoy
watching them sink.

Mandelson appeared to leak sensitive UK government tax plans to

Tubers do this too.. And ppl make fun of China using code words to

"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social

[W]hile living standards have stagnated for most people.. the wealthy
and privileged have continued to get much wealthier.  About half of
all house purchases in the UK now are for 'additional dwellings' -
second homes, buy-to-lets, etc - because 10% of the population can
outbid everybody else, drive up asset prices, and when it's something
people can't live without, like a home, force them to pay unreasonable
rents - further increasing inequality, both directly and indirectly,
by sucking money out of local economies into elite enclaves."
