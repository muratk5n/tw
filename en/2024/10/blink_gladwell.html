<h1>Blink</h1>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell</p>
<p>The psychologists Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson created [..a] test,
using black college students and twenty questions taken from the
Graduate Record Examination, the standardized test used for entry into
graduate school. When the students were asked to identify their race
on a pretest questionnaire, that simple act was sufficient to prime
them with all the negative stereotypes associated with African
Americans and academic achievement — and the number of items they got
right was cut in half. As a society, we place enormous faith in tests
because we think that they are a reliable indicator of the test
taker’s ability and knowledge. But are they really? If a white student
from a prestigious private high school gets a higher SAT score than a
black student from an inner-city school, is it because she’s truly a
better student, or is it because to be white and to attend a
prestigious high school is to be constantly primed with the idea of
“smart”?..</p>
<p>Aronson and Steele found the same thing with the black students who
did so poorly after they were reminded of their race. “I talked to the
black students afterward, and I asked them, ‘Did anything lower your
performance?’ ” Aronson said. “I would ask, ‘Did it bug you that I
asked you to indicate your race?’ Because it clearly had a huge effect
on their performance. And they would always say no and something like
‘You know, I just don’t think I’m smart enough to be here.’ ”</p>
