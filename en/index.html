<p>F24: "Britain on Tuesday unveiled its first national plan to curb
'forever chemicals,' seeking to cut risks to human health and the
environment, the government said. PFAS, used in products from cookware
to food packaging, persist for decades and accumulate in nature,
posing threats likely to endure for hundreds of years."</p>

<p>CNBC: "Gold and silver rebound after historic wipeout as analysts say
thematic drivers stay intact"</p>

<p>I love it.. Mandelson is a "New Labour" guy, one of those Clintonite
Brits, economic right social left type "progressive". We can enjoy
watching them sink.</p>
<p>CNN: "The latest tranche of documents has revealed that [Peter]
Mandelson appeared to leak sensitive UK government tax plans to
Epstein. They also show that his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva,
regularly received undisclosed payments from him."</p>
<hr />
<p>It looks like the Winsdors booted out their troublemaker right on
time.. If he was still a royal he would have been a royal pain in the
ass right now.</p>

<p>Corps are your tyrants, America. Their silent opression is worse than
any kind of government can bring to bear.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tubers do this too.. And ppl make fun of China using code words to
bypass censorship.</p>
<p>"It's because the words like die or suicide are often censored on
platforms like Tiktok.. people started saying [unalive] instead."</p>

<p>"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social</p>
<p>[W]hile living standards have stagnated for most people.. the wealthy
and privileged have continued to get much wealthier.  About half of
all house purchases in the UK now are for 'additional dwellings' -
second homes, buy-to-lets, etc - because 10% of the population can
outbid everybody else, drive up asset prices, and when it's something
people can't live without, like a home, force them to pay unreasonable
rents - further increasing inequality, both directly and indirectly,
by sucking money out of local economies into elite enclaves."</p>
