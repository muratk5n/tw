"Thorium is three to five times more abundant than uranium in the
earth's crust..  produces less radiotoxicity than the U02 because it
produces fewer amounts of actinides, reducing the radiotoxicity of
long life nuclear waste. Th02 has higher corrosion resistance than
U02, besides being chemically stable due to their low water
solubility. The burning of Pu in a reactor based in thorium also
decreases the inventories of Pu from the current fuel cycles,
resulting in lower risks of material diversion for use in nuclear
weapons"

Adam Taggart: "If thorium is so much better than uranium, why did the
U.S. abandon thorium in the 1960s–70s why did we shutter this thing in
in the 70s?  Why did we go down the uranium path and not the thorium
path?'"

Sorensen: "I spent years finding the answer to that myself. I ended up
writing my thesis at the University of Tennessee on the very
question. The really short answer is, very early on, our priority was
weapons and thorium was not a path to weapons... And so much work had
been done on uranium and plutonium versus thorium that it was more
ready to be demonstrated. And so the efforts of the Nixon and Carter
and Reagan administrations went into what was called the Clinch River
Breeder Reactor around uranium, plutonium and thorium was
shelved. That was a bad move. That was a mistake. We really should
have been continuing the work of Dr. Weinberg at at Oakidge and and
pushing the thorium direction. He correctly foresaw the problems that
we would run into with the uranium approach in every facet, both in
safety and in ultimate fuel utilization. And he would have not been
one bit surprised to be here in 2025 with us right now going 'I could
have told you you'd be in this problem way back when because you
didn't take the the thorium direction'."

Taggart: "So okay so uranium essentially is a less efficient fuel. it
has more safety issues.. but it offered the opportunity for
weaponization and I'm guessing because of the interest of the
military-industrial complex, [they] really pushed for that and then
once we had enough momentum around that technology it just became
easier to continue that momentum than to try to go back to the drawing
board with thorium"

SCMP: "China sets launch date for world’s first thorium molten salt
nuclear power station.. Construction of a molten salt nuclear power
plant that uses thorium as fuel instead of uranium is set to begin in
the Gobi Desert.. The reactor does not need water for cooling because
it uses liquid salt and carbon dioxide to transfer heat and generate
electricity.

Using thorium as its primary fuel, it means worries over a potential
shortage of uranium – the usual fuel used in nuclear reactors – are
allayed, as thorium is more abundant than uranium. According to some
scientists’ estimates, China has enough thorium reserves to meet its
energy needs for 20,000 years. The reactor is scheduled to be
completed and operational in 2029, generating heat at a maximum power
of 60 megawatts.

Part of the thermal energy will drive a 10MW electric power unit, and
the rest will produce hydrogen by splitting water molecules at high
temperature"

Live Science: "[04/20] For the first time ever, scientists in China
have refueled an experimental nuclear reactor without shutting it down
— a significant advance in weaning the world off fossil fuels and onto
more efficient, low-carbon energy sources.. The breakthrough, achieved
using a prototype molten-salt design which runs on liquid thorium
instead of uranium, means that China "now leads the global frontier"
in nuclear innovation, the project's lead scientist, Xu Hongjie, said
during an April 8 meeting at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Thorium reactors were first developed in the 1950s in the U.S., before
it went all-in on uranium, according to the International Atomic
Energy Agency. Following this decision, this early research was later
declassified, and the Chinese researchers made use of it for the
current project."
