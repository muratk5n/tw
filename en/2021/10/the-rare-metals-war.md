# The Rare Metals War

Guillaume Pitron 

The biggest quantity of rare earths is extracted from the bowels of
Jiangxi, in the heart of tropical China, which is where our story
begins.

Wang Jing knows this better than anyone.. he spent years working at
this illegal mine concealed by a copse of eucalyptus trees. He tells
me how he would chip away at red-tinted rock and crush prodigious
rubble aggregates alongside other miners, both men and women...

‘It’s poison,’ says Wang Jing. ‘The chemicals used for refining the
minerals were poured straight into the ground.’ The sulphuric and
hydrochloric acids would pollute the nearby stream to the point that
‘it was impossible for any plant to grow’. Because the closest housing
lies far from the Yaxi mountains, there was no visible impact on
residents. But elsewhere, housing was much closer, he said.  The
10,000 or so mines spread across China have played a big role in
destroying the country’s environment. 20 Pollution damage by the
coal-mining industry is well documented. But barely reported is the
fact that mining rare metals also produces pollution, and to such an
extent that China has stopped counting contamination events..

Latin America has already started to experience similar problems with
lithium mining — a white metal lying below the salt flats of Bolivia,
Chile, and Argentine. It is considered critical by the US, and demand
is expected to soar on the back of the electric car boom that has
jacked up its global production. Naturally, Argentina has its sights
set on becoming the giant of lithium, and between now and 2025 the
country has the capacity to produce up to 165,000 tonnes a year, or 45
per cent of global demand, provided it can get foreign investors on
board.

In May 2017, all the rare metal exploration, mining, and refining
companies operating in Latin America met on the banks of Rio Plata near
Buenos Aires for the Arminera international mining trade fair...

[S]ome thirty Greenpeace activists had blocked the entrance to the
trade fair, brandishing banners calling out the lies of the mining
industry. ‘Everything they say is pure greenwashing,’ said one of its
members, Gonzalo Strano. ‘There’s no such thing as sustainable
mining. Not only does it dig out the ground by definition, it uses
chemicals and massive amounts of water, which is a problem.’...

In 2006, some sixty companies producing indium — a rare metal used in
the manufacture of certain solar-panel technologies — released tonnes
of chemicals into the Xiang River in Hunan, jeopardising the
meridional province’s drinking water and the health of its
residents. In 2011, journalists reported on the damage to the
ecosystems of the Ting River in the seaside province of Fujian, due to
the operation of a mine rich in gallium — an up-and-coming metal for
the manufacture of energy-efficient light bulbs. And in Ganzhou, where
I landed, the local press recently reported that the toxic waste dumps
created by a mining company producing tungsten — a critical metal for
wind-turbine blades — had obstructed and polluted many tributaries of
the Yangtze River...

A recent report by the Blacksmith Institute identifies the mining
industry as the second-most-polluting industry in the world, behind
lead-battery recycling, and ahead of the dye industry, industrial
dumpsites, and tanneries. It has moved up one rung since the 2013
rankings, in which the much-maligned petrochemical industry doesn’t
even crack the top ten. Given China’s dominant role in the global
supply of rare metals, we cannot accurately assess the progress made
in combating global warming without properly accounting for Beijing’s
ecological performance. Which is catastrophic, to say the least...

[Another] party pooper was John Petersen, a Texan lawyer with an
extensive career in the electric battery industry. Based on number
crunching, countless academic papers, and his own research, Peterson
reached an astonishing conclusion. Rewind to 2012, when researchers at
the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) compared the carbon
impact of a conventional fuel-driven car against that of an electric
car. Their first finding was that the production of the supposedly
more energy-efficient electric car requires far more energy than the
production of the conventional car. This is mostly on account of the
electric car’s very heavy lithium-ion battery. The battery of
prominent US company Tesla’s Model S, for instance, weighs in at 544
kilograms, or 25 per cent of the car’s weight...

Then there’s the composition of the lithium-ion battery: 80 per cent
nickel, 15 per cent cobalt, 5 per cent aluminium, as well as lithium,
copper, manganese, steel, and graphite. By now, we are familiar with
the conditions in which these minerals are extracted in China,
Kazakhstan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But we also need
to consider how these minerals are refined, not to mention the
logistics of their transportation and assembly. The UCLA researchers
reached the conclusion that industrialising electric vehicles is three
to four times more energy-intensive than industrialising conventional
cars.

[Not requiring petrol] brings down its carbon dioxide emissions to 32
tonnes from factory to scrapyard, compared with almost double that for
a conventional vehicle.. [but] a battery that is powerful enough to
drive a vehicle for 300 kilometres emits twice as much carbon as
production-phase emissions — a figure we can then triple for batteries
with a 500-kilometre range. Therefore, over its entire lifecycle, an
electric car may produce as much as three-quarters of the carbon
emissions produced by a petrol car. And the more powerful the electric
cars are, the more energy they need for their production, potentially
increasing greenhouse gases... Petersen’s conclusion? ‘Electric
vehicles may be technically possible, but their production will never
be environmentally sustainable'...

The 2016 report by the French Environment & Energy Management Agency
(ADEME) finds: ‘the energy consumption of an electric vehicle over its
entire lifecycle is, on the whole, similar to that of a diesel
vehicle.’ The report also finds that its environmental impact is ‘on a
par with [that of] the petrol car’...

This leaves us with a list of unanswered questions. Is the replacement
impact of EV batteries, which have a short lifespan, being taken into
account? Do we know the precise ecological cost of all the electronics
and connected components packed into these electric vehicles? What
about the environmental impact of recycling these mostly still-new
vehicles in the future? And how much energy will it take to build the
necessary electric grids and plants to meet these new needs?

Ultimately, as was quietly admitted to me by a US rare metals expert
in Toronto that day, ‘No one in the green-energy business is going to
communicate on these points. Besides, don’t we all want to believe
that we’re making things better rather than making things worse?’
