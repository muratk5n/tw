<h1>The Value of Everything</h1>
<p>Mariana Mazucatto</p>
<p>Indeed, a key way to tackle some of society’s most pressing problems
today is to learn lessons from historical periods in which bold
ambitions were set to tackle difficult technological
problems. Consider two lessons from the man on moon mission. First,
the agencies involved, from NASA to DARPA, built up their own capacity
and competences. They did not outsource their tasks, or the resulting
knowledge, to the private sector. This practice should be borne in
mind when considering the currently fashionable public–private
partnership arrangements. They will only succeed as dynamic
knowledge-intensive collaborations, with both sides equally committed
to investing in in-house competencies and capabilities.</p>
<p>Second, the Apollo mission required different types of actors and
sectors to collaborate, from aerospace to innovations in textiles. The
focus was not on subsidising a sector (aeronautics) but on solving
problems together, which required many sectors and different types of
public and private actors to collaborate – even those in low-tech
sectors like textiles.</p>
