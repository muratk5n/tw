# Eat Yourself Slim

Montignac

The theory of slimming based on the low-calorie approach is without
doubt the greatest scientific "fudge" of the twentieth century...

In the early 80s, when I was in my late thirties, my scales read 12st
12lb - almost a stone more than my ideal weight. But then again, all
things considered, that did not seem too bad for a man over six feet
tall and approaching forty.. Up to then I had led a fairly
conventional social and professional lifestyle and my tendency to put
on weight had seemed to level off. My ”overeating”, if indeed I
overate at all, was only very occasional and tended to occur in a
family context. When you come, as I do, from South West France, you
have been brought up to value gastronomic cuisine as part of your
cultural heritage. I had long since given up sugar, or at least, sugar
in coffee. I never ate potatoes, claiming to be allergic to them, and,
apart from wine, very rarely touched alcohol... When I looked around
me I felt no more overweight than the average..

Then, overnight, my professional circumstances changed. I was
appointed to a new post with an international dimension at the
European headquarters of the American multinational company I worked
for... three months after taking up my new post I had put on [weight]..

Like everyone else, I started off by trying to apply the usual
weight-loss rules and, like everyone else, I became thoroughly
disillusioned with the lack of positive results.

But soon afterwards, as luck would have it, I came across a general
practitioner with a keen interest in nutritional problems. He gave me
some advice, and the guidelines he suggested to me seemed to call into
question the fundamental basis of traditional dietetics.  It was not
long before I was achieving very promising results. So I then decided
to delve further into the theory...

In 1930 two American doctors, Newburgh and Johnson, of the University
of Michigan, suggested in one of their papers that ”obesity results
from a diet too high in calories, rather than from any metabolic
deficiency". Their study on energy balance was based on very limited
data and, above all, had been conducted over too short a period to
deserve serious scientific acceptance. This did not prevent their
study from being immediately and widely acclaimed as irrefutable
scientific truth, and it has been treated as ”gospel” ever since...

The first question is: When the consumption of calories is reduced,
why does weight loss not follow? Actually, weight loss does occur, but
only temporarily. This is, in fact, where Newburgh and Johnson went
wrong, in that they collected their data over much too short a period
of time...

Insulin

[A]n excess of ”Calories taken in” over ”calories burned up” does not
in itself explain why we put on weight. In other words, it does not
account for how the body comes to store fat.

Whether or not we accumulate body fat is directly linked to the
secretion of insulin, so we will first take a brief look at
this. Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas and it plays a
vital role in human metabolism...

When, for example, you eat a piece of bread with butter, [.. the]
carbohydrate is broken down into glucose; the blood glucose level
rises; the pancreas secretes insulin. However.. the lipid is converted
into a fatty acid in the blood...

[But] a piece of cheese, eaten on its own..  involves no release of
glucose into the bloodstream. Consequently, the pancreas secretes
virtually no insulin. In the absence of insulin, the energy cannot be
stored away as fat.

[What to Avoid]

Sugar

Sugar is the hands-down, outright winner in the bad carbohydrates
stakes. It should always carry the skull and crossbones symbol, like
other lethal substances... for tens of thousands of years human beings
did not have such a thing, and they were none the worse for that. Just
the opposite, in fact.  Less than 200 years ago, sugar was still a
luxury hardly ever available to most of the population...

[T]he body does not need to get sugar from outside (this is just what
upsets the blood glucose level). It can produce its own sugar in the
form of glucose when it needs it, and this is far and away what it
prefers to do.

Starchy Foods

Most [starchy] foods are bad carbohydrates and some need to be
completely excluded from your diet. The number one starchy food is the
potato. You may be interested to know that when the potato was brought
back from the New World by explorers in 540, the French firmly
rejected it, considering this root vegetable fit only for pigs. They
thought it so unpleasant they refused to eat it.. For two centuries
the French continued to pour corn on the "pig root". It was not until
1789, when Larmentier published his Treatise on the cultivation and
uses of the potato, that people in France finally came round to eating
it. The famine that was raging at the time was an additional
incentive. It was later discovered that the potato is rich in vitamins
and minerals, though it loses most of these when it is cooked and,
especially, when it is peeled. Recent tests have shown that the potato
releases a very large quantity of glucose into the system.

Bad Carbohydrates: These are all the carbohydrates whose absorption
leads to a large rise in blood glucose. This applies to table sugar in
whatever form (on its own or combined with other food stuffs, as in
cakes). The classification also covers all processed carbohydrates,
such as white flour and white rice, and also alcohol (particularly
spirits), as well as potatoes and corn (maize).
