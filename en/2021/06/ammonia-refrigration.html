<h1>Ammonia Refigration</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.araner.com/blog/ammonia-refrigeration-choice-industrial-refrigeration">Link</a></p>
<p>Ammonia, a naturally-occurring gas composed of hydrogen and nitrogen,
belongs to a class of refrigerants considered natural refrigerants;
which also includes hydrocarbons, water, air, and carbon dioxide. As
their name implies, these are naturally-occurring substances capable
of refrigeration; they are all environmentally friendly with
negligible global warming potential and ozone depletion potential,
with ammonia being harmless for the environment. This is especially
true when compared to the synthetic refrigerants that have been
popular for the last century...</p>
<p>Liquid anhydrous ammonia intended for refrigeration is stored under
pressure, usually in a tank. Release of the pressure on the ammonia
results in rapid vaporization. The vaporization process results in
cooling much as evaporation of water from a surface do, the
temperature drops to the normal boiling point of anhydrous ammonia
about -33⁰C. In fact, ammonia’s thermodynamic properties allow it to
outperform synthetic refrigerants in most applications</p>
