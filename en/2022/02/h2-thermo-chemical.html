<h1>Thermo-Chemical Water Splitting</h1>
<h3>Solar</h3>
<p>Thermochemical water splitting uses high temperatures—from
concentrated solar power or from the waste heat of nuclear power
reactions—and chemical reactions to produce hydrogen and oxygen from
water. This is a long-term technology pathway, with potentially low or
no greenhouse gas emissions [3].</p>
<p>Thermochemical water splitting processes use high-temperature heat
(500°–2,000°C) to drive a series of chemical reactions that produce
hydrogen. The chemicals used in the process are reused within each
cycle, creating a closed loop that consumes only water and produces
hydrogen and oxygen. The necessary high temperatures can be generated
[by] concentrating sunlight onto a reactor tower using a field of mirror
"heliostats," </p>
<p>Numerous solar thermochemical water-splitting cycles have been
investigated for hydrogen production, each with different sets of
operating conditions, engineering challenges, and hydrogen production
opportunities. In fact, more than 300 water-splitting cycles are
described in the literature.</p>
<p>Two examples of thermochemical water splitting cycles [are] the
"direct" two-step cerium oxide thermal cycle and the "hybrid" copper
chloride cycle...</p>
<p>Exciting progress continues in this field, leveraging synergies with
concentrated solar power technologies, and with emerging solar-fuel
production technologies.</p>

<h3>Nuclear, Molten Salt</h3>
<p>A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of nuclear fission reactor in
which the primary nuclear reactor coolant and/or the fuel is a molten
salt mixture... 1960's Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment aimed to prove
the concept of a nuclear power plant which implements a thorium fuel
cycle in a breeder reactor [4]. Increased research into Generation IV
reactor designs began to renew interest in the technology, with
multiple nations having projects and, as of September 2021, China is
on the verge of starting its TMSR-LF1 thorium MSR..</p>
<p>A further key characteristic of MSRs is operating temperatures of
around 700 °C (1,292 °F), significantly higher than traditional LWRs
at around 300 °C (572 °F).. economical hydrogen production</p>
<p>Thorium is three to five times more abundant than uranium in the
earth's crust..  produces less radiotoxicity than the U02 because it
produces fewer amounts of actinides, reducing the radiotoxicity of
long life nuclear waste. Th02 has higher corrosion resistance than
U02, besides being chemically stable due to their low water
solubility. The burning of Pu in a reactor based in thorium also
decreases the inventories of Pu from the current fuel cycles,
resulting in lower risks of material diversion for use in nuclear
weapons [5].</p>

<h3>Nuclear, HTGR</h3>
<p>High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGR) use helium instead of
water to cool the nuclear fission reaction, and its inherently safe
design protects it against meltdowns as seen previously in Three Mile
Island, Chernobyl, or Fukushima. The fissile material, the fuel is
kept in a new design called TRISO that streamlines the usage of the
fuel, helps with its disposal, and guards against most form of
proliferation.  The high temperatures enable applications such as
process heat or hydrogen production via the thermochemical
sulfur–iodine cycle [1].</p>
<p>Helium is an inert gas, so it will generally not chemically react with
any material. Additionally, exposing helium to neutron radiation does
not make it radioactive, unlike most other possible coolants.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="htgr.jpg" /></p>
<p>Even during the loss of the helium gas coolant initiated by piping
rupture events, the heat produced by the core will be removed by heat
dissipation from reactor pressure vessel so that the fuel will not
failure. This means that the HTGR has significant safety which has no
concern of core meltdown or radioactivity release accidents [2].</p>
<p>From the economic point of view, HTGR is a superior nuclear reactor
since it can reduce extra facilities due to its inherent safety and
achieve high thermal efficiency due to the high temperature heat. The
power generation cost of the HTGR power plant is estimated to be about
0.029 USD/kWh [whereas] power generation cost of commercial light
water reactor is about 0.037 USD/kWh.</p>
