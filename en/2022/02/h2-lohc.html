<h1>LOHC</h1>
<p>The LOHC (liquid organic hydrogen carrier) concept is a capable
technology [1] for supplying hydrogen refuelling stations due to its
high hydrogen storage densities (57 $kg_{H2} m_{LOHC}^{-3}$) and easy
handling (liquid, low toxicity, low flammability). ...</p>
<p>The LOHC technology is based on the chemical bonding of hydrogen to
liquid organic carriers, which are mostly aromatic hydrocarbons or
heterocyclic substances. ...</p>
<p>There are three different types of organic carriers: methyl
cyclohexane-toluene, NEC (N-ethyl carbazole), and DBT (dibenzyl
toluene).</p>
<p>In contrast to some other chemical hydrogen storage processes, these
reactions are reversible. The carrier molecule is cycled between a
loaded and unloaded state.  ... The most technically advanced concept,
which is pursued by Hydrogenious Technologies, is based on the use of
the common heat transfer oil dibenzyltoluene, which is available in
large quantities and is not classified as a dangerous good.</p>
<p>Compared to other technologies that store hydrogen at temperatures of
-253 °C or at pressures up to 500 bar, using LOHC technology greatly
reduces the cost of handling hydrogen. </p>
<p>The hydrogen-rich or loaded LOHC (LOHC+) can be transported via
standard tank trucks to the hydrogen refueling stations, which are
equipped with a dehydrogenation system. There, the hydrogen can be
produced as needed and then integrated into the existing hydrogen
refueling station technology. The German Climate Action Plan of 2050
acknowledges that LOHC technology has considerable potential for
establishing hydrogen as a fuel.</p>
<p>The question of just how hydrogen will get around the world, and what
it will cost, is key to putting in place global hydrogen
infrastructure [3]. A report.. from Rethink Energy, part of Rethink
Technology Research, shows that the bulk of the effort will be split
between pipelines and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), often
transported in ships – and points to the limiting cost factors which
shall define each transport use case.</p>
<p>One VLCC ship [3] can carry up to 350,000 DWT which would be
equivalent to 17,000 tons H2.  One train in Europe can pull up to 35
wagons which would be equivalent to 59 tons of H2. A quick calculation
shows the amount of energy that can be carried across Atlantic by a
fleet of 20 ships using LOHC techology,</p>

<p>In March, the Queensland University of Technology [QUT] made history
when it achieved the first export of a small quantity of clean, green
hydrogen produced in Australia from renewable energy, to Japanese
energy giant JXTG – proving that it was in fact possible.</p>
<p>The actors involved; JXTG, is Japan’s largest petroleum
conglomerate. QUT provided solar panels that can work with salt
water. The second link above also says:</p>
<p>"[H2] was created by adding water and acid to a chemical called
toluene in an electrochemical process using solar energy. The toluene
was converted into a substance called methyl cyclohexane (MCH) using
JXTG’s process powered by QUT’s solar arrays".</p>
<p>Methyl cyclohexane is a convenient carrier for H2, as liquid and at
normal temparatures.</p>
<p>"Methyl cyclohexane is a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like
odor. Flash point 25°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in
water. Vapors heavier than air".</p>
<p>On the receiving end.. "once shipped to Japan, the MCH was converted
back to toluene and the hydrogen extracted for use in a suitable fuel
cell or vehicle. The toluene is then available for re-use in the
transportation cycle."</p>
<p>Australia has the sunshine, ports, expertise and logistics in
transportation. The process described above uses a proprietry tech
developed by JXTG. If I was a country with lots of sunshine, I'd
invite them to set up shop in my country, let them produce, export H2
(to themselves in Japan) from sunshine, tax their ass, and use the
money for whatever. U'd literally be making money out of thin air. </p>
