"Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries debuted on Wednesday the world's
first marine carrier that transports liquefied hydrogen, using
technology that will vastly expand cargo capacity of the green energy
source.

A crowd of 4,000 people gathered at Kawasaki's shipyard in Kobe for
the naming and launch ceremony of the Suiso Frontier -- a name
adopting the Japanese word for hydrogen. The vessel, measuring 116
meters long, will be fully completed next fall.

Kawasaki will later add tanks that will carry the hydrogen. By
liquefying hydrogen at minus 253 degrees Celsius, the cargo can be
compressed to one-800th of its gaseous volume.

The carrier will transport to Japan hydrogen produced in Australia
from cheap coal, with trial shipments due to begin before March 2021"

Long-distance shipping of hydrogen will not require wildly new,
untested tech. We already ship liquified natural gas (LNG) at minus
160 Celcius. Go down little more that gets you H2 storage.
