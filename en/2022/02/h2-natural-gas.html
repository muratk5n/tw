<h1>H2 From Methane (Natural Gas)</h1>
<p>If hydrogen is produced from natural gas with an added carbon capture [1]
and storage step, the end result is called blue hydrogen. This is a proven
process (see below) and there are even certifications for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/blue-hydrogen-sabic/8555324/">H2 Fuel News</a></p>
<p>Saudi Basic Industries Corp. subsidiary SUBIC Agri-Nutrients Co. has
announced that it has received the first independent certification for
the production of blue hydrogen and ammonia in the world.  The
certification for the company’s H2 production was granted by German
agency TÜV Rheinland</p>
<p>News</p>
<p>India’s Reliance Industries has made a major statement of intent
revealing that it aims to become the world’s top blue hydrogen
producer with the repurposing of a $4bn plant for blue hydrogen</p>
<p>Even Liebreich, a skeptic in many ways, admits blue hydrogen is
doable: "We have to learn to love blue hydrogen — and make sure it's
as clean as possible"</p>

<p>Natural gas contains methane (CH4) that can be used to produce
hydrogen with thermal processes, such as steam-methane reformation and
partial oxidation.</p>
<p>Steam-Methane Reforming</p>
<p>Most hydrogen produced today in the United States is made via
steam-methane reforming, a mature production process in which
high-temperature steam (700°C–1,000°C) is used to produce hydrogen
from a methane source, such as natural gas. In steam-methane
reforming, methane reacts with steam under 3–25 bar pressure (1 bar =
14.5 psi) in the presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen, carbon
monoxide, and a relatively small amount of carbon dioxide. Steam
reforming is endothermic—that is, heat must be supplied to the process
for the reaction to proceed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in what is called the "water-gas shift reaction," the
carbon monoxide and steam are reacted using a catalyst to produce
carbon dioxide and more hydrogen. In a final process step called
"pressure-swing adsorption," carbon dioxide and other impurities are
removed from the gas stream, leaving essentially pure hydrogen. Steam
reforming can also be used to produce hydrogen from other fuels, such
as ethanol, propane, or even gasoline.</p>
<p>Steam-methane reforming reaction</p>
<p>CH4 + H2O (+ heat) → CO + 3H2</p>
<p>Water-gas shift reaction</p>
<p>CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (+ small amount of heat)</p>
<p>Partial Oxidation</p>
<p>In partial oxidation, the methane and other hydrocarbons in natural
gas react with a limited amount of oxygen (typically from air) that is
not enough to completely oxidize the hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide
and water. With less than the stoichiometric amount of oxygen
available, the reaction products contain primarily hydrogen and carbon
monoxide (and nitrogen, if the reaction is carried out with air rather
than pure oxygen), and a relatively small amount of carbon dioxide and
other compounds. Subsequently, in a water-gas shift reaction, the
carbon monoxide reacts with water to form carbon dioxide and more
hydrogen.</p>
<p>Partial oxidation is an exothermic process—it gives off heat. The
process is, typically, much faster than steam reforming and requires a
smaller reactor vessel. As can be seen in chemical reactions of
partial oxidation, this process initially produces less hydrogen per
unit of the input fuel than is obtained by steam reforming of the same
fuel.</p>
