<h1>Paraffin Wax</h1>

<p>[R]esearch reported in the nature journal Scientific Reports has
discovered that the storage of hydrogen in, and rapid evolution from,
paraffin wax could be the solution.</p>
<p>The research team, cited as Gonzalez-Cortes, S. et al., has developed
highly selective catalysts with the assistance of microwave
irradiation, which can extract hydrogen from hydrocarbons instantly
through a non-oxidative dehydrogenation process.</p>
<p>The wax material is safe, efficient and could facilitate its
application in a HFCV. Most Importantly, hydrogen storage materials
made of wax can be manufactured through completely sustainable
processes utilising biomass or other renewable feedstocks.</p>

<p>Researchers at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Cardiff in
the UK, and the [..] Saudi Arabia have shown that benign,
readily-available heavy alkane hydrocarbon wax is capable of rapidly
releasing large amounts of hydrogen—sufficient to meet the 7 wt%
target set by the US DOE—through microwave-assisted catalytic
decomposition.</p>
<p>This discovery, reported in an open-access paper in Scientific
Reports, offers a new material and system for safe and efficient
hydrogen storage and could facilitate its application in a hydrogen
fuel cell vehicle. Hydrocarbon wax is the major product of the low
temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process from syngas and is
currently thermally “cracked” to produce various fuels.</p>
