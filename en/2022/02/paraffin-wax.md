[R]esearch reported in the nature journal Scientific Reports has
discovered that the storage of hydrogen in, and rapid evolution from,
paraffin wax could be the solution.

The research team, cited as Gonzalez-Cortes, S. et al., has developed
highly selective catalysts with the assistance of microwave
irradiation, which can extract hydrogen from hydrocarbons instantly
through a non-oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The wax material is safe, efficient and could facilitate its
application in a HFCV. Most Importantly, hydrogen storage materials
made of wax can be manufactured through completely sustainable
processes utilising biomass or other renewable feedstocks.

Researchers at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Cardiff in
the UK, and the [..] Saudi Arabia have shown that benign,
readily-available heavy alkane hydrocarbon wax is capable of rapidly
releasing large amounts of hydrogen—sufficient to meet the 7 wt%
target set by the US DOE—through microwave-assisted catalytic
decomposition.

This discovery, reported in an open-access paper in Scientific
Reports, offers a new material and system for safe and efficient
hydrogen storage and could facilitate its application in a hydrogen
fuel cell vehicle. Hydrocarbon wax is the major product of the low
temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process from syngas and is
currently thermally “cracked” to produce various fuels.
