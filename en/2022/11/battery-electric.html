<h1>Problems of Battery Electric Tech</h1>
<p>Lion battery tech suffers from multidude of problems that makes it
unfit as a basis of a green transition, and as a general storage
mechanism.</p>
<p><a name='density'></a></p>
<h3>Low Energy Density</h3>
<p>Batteries have low energy density. Plug Power CEO: "Power Density and
Range: fuel cell energy density is four times more than batteries, and
a tank of hydrogen contains more than double the energy of a battery
at the same weight"</p>
<p>Low energy density means heavy-duty transport, or battery based
airplanes are out of the question for a green transition.</p>
<p>easyJet: "When we.. looked back a few years ago, we realised clearly
that the climate emergency is coming our way and that we needed to
address our sustainability issue – and we knew that our passengers
care about that as well.. It was about the time when we started to see
the first electric cars, the Tesla vehicles.. and there was
expectation that everything would go electric. However, once we got
into the detail and the physics and the science behind electric, it
became clear that battery-powered aeroplanes were not going to have
sufficient energy density to power a large commercial aircraft"</p>
<p>Alvera: "A kilogram of gasoline holds 13 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of
energy; a kilogram of lithium-ion battery holds less than 0.3
kWh. This means electricity isn’t going to be the best way of powering
sectors which need to take lots of energy with them. Just think of
long-haul flying: we would need so many heavy batteries that the plane
wouldn’t be able to take off. And batteries won’t compete with
molecules to propel cargo ships across oceans" [3]</p>
<p><a name='reserves'></a></p>
<h3>Insufficient Lithium Reserves</h3>
<p>Even for motor vehicle road transportation, widespread use of lion
batteries is impossible. Existing estimated lithium reserves are at
17.0 millon tons. In 2020, 48.6 percent of all oil consumed in the
OECD was related to motor vehicle usage [1]. 2019 crude oil
consumption 100.37 million b/d, 1 barrel carries approximately 1700
kwh of energy. Let's try to calculate how much lithium would be needed
to store a day's worth of energy for transport in batteries,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">reserves = 17.0 # mtones
kwh_day = 100.37*1e6*1700*0.486
req = ((kwh_day / 70.0) * 60.0) / 1e9
print (&quot;%d mil. tons&quot; % req)
print (&quot;Requirement is %d times of reserves&quot; % (req/reserves))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">71 mil. tons
Requirement is 4 times of reserves
</code></pre>
<p>We cannot even migrate all driving to a lion based system.</p>
<p>For total energy use the picture is more grim.  According to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption">EIA</a>,
estimated world energy consumption was 157,481 Terrawatt Hours in
2013, meaning 431 TWh/day. If we were to store today's energy
consumption one day in batteries,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">consumed_one_day = 431 * 1e9 # Kwh
req = ((consumed_one_day / 70.0) * 60.0) / 1e9
print (&quot;%d mil. tons&quot; % req)
print (&quot;Requirement is %d times of reserves&quot; % (req/reserves))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">369 mil. tons
Requirement is 21 times of reserves
</code></pre>
<p>.. it would require over 20 times the amount of available lithium in
the world.</p>
<p><a name='degradation'></a></p>
<h3>Degradation</h3>
<p>Lion batteries have a huge degradation problem, ie with every use the
performance of the battery becomes worse. Most know this fact probably
from their use of notebook batteries, eventually the battery becomes
unusable.  Well, since some retarded genius decided to migrate the
same tech to a car, now the same problem has migrated to this domain
as well, except in a larger scale.</p>
<p>From the owner of a home storage system: "[If I am] cycling through my
battery Powerwall every single day, I'm actually degrading the
battery, and the sooner that it's going to basically be dead and
unusable and you need to go buy another one. My battery pack is only
there for an emergency, like if something crazy happens like the power
goes out.. And when I say it's not worth the money.. I could have
taken that $20,000 that it cost to put these on the wall, and I could
have put a bunch more, maybe 20, maybe 30 more solar panels on the
house.  Every single day that would be generating money for me and
money for our house, decreasing the cost"</p>

<p>The 100% Problem</p>
<p>Problems do not end there; just like charging / discharging the
battery too many times degrades it, so does charging it UP TO
100%. You read that right, a lion battery should not be charged fully,
only partially, almost fully up to a point, otherwise again, the
battery goes bad. In fact some EV's have a <a href="https://toot.cat/@JimG/109946177003223832">feature</a> 
that stops them from being fully charged. Let alone being a bizarre, and comical
shortcoming, this "feature" assures a portion of lithium in a
battery is by definition a waste, it sits there not to be used.</p>

<p><a name='cold'></a></p>
<p>The Cold Weather Problem</p>
<p>According to American Chemical Society, when temperatures fall below
freezing, lion battery's electrical performance declines, and when
conditions are cold enough, they can fail to transfer any charge. It’s
why some people living in the U.S. Midwest have trouble with their
electric cars in the dead of winter, and why it’s risky to use these
batteries in space explorations. Tests show that electric cars lose
40% of their estimated range in cold weather conditions, which is
probably why such conditions are never advertised in BEV marketing.</p>
<h3>Charging</h3>
<p>Speed</p>
<p>Another big complaint about batteries is their charging is slow. For
lion based vehicles the fastest method, known as direct current
charger, can charge a battery up to 80 percent in 20 minutes to an
hour which is pretty slow compared to refueling a car. And this "fast
charging" has major downsides - it degrades the battery quicker.</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>Lion batteries routinely blow up. The cause can be from mild collision
between an EV and another car, or salt water during a hurricane as was
witnessed recently in Florida, or no reason at all as seen in an ebike
shop in New York.</p>
<iframe width="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/46y3FN4fKlE" title="E-Bikes, E-Scooters Injuries Multiplying" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Insurance Journal: "A Florida senator is calling for action from the
Transportation Department and automakers after a series of electric
vehicle fires tied to Hurricane Ian.. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) raised
concerns.. 'This emerging threat has forced local fire departments to
divert resources away from hurricane recovery to control and contain
these dangerous fires,' Scott said. 'Car fires from electric vehicles
have proven to be extremely dangerous and last for a prolonged period,
taking in many cases up to six hours to burn out.'"</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Once the fires start firefighters find it incredibly
hard to put out using traditional methods, this is due to inherent
weaknesses of this particular technology. Lithium salts in the battery
are self-oxidizing, which means that they can't be 'starved out' like
a traditional fire.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>All the problems listed above are enough to doom a technology on their
own. Combined, they are fatal. Considering adaption, TCO issues and
knowing tech migration cycles, even considering a total shift to this
tech would be foolish. The issue goes beyond being able to demonstrate
a car can move on batteries from point A to point B. There are larger
engineering, economic issues involved here. The industry will soon
realize if all cars, heavy transport, shipping, air flight cannot be
battery electric, it's best not to shift even a portion of energy use
to battery electric. The crazed proponents this technology might soon
find themselves as the supporters of Betamax found decades ago. Stuck
with a degrading tech, going nowhere.</p>
