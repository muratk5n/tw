Paul Matthews 

Now lets get something straight here. I’m an electrician. Nothing
would please me more than to see a transition away from the internal
combustion engine and towards universal electric transport. However
just as my paper on “power networks for dummies” exposed the
impossibility of replacing coal fired power plants with renewable
generation, this paper will spell out the facts surrounding electric
cars and how much (or how little) they can offer in regards to
“greening the planet”.

First, we’re going to have to bring you up to speed with a few
issues. Unfortunately this time we’re going to have to get the
calculator out. I promise to keep the maths and numbers as simple as
possible.

Before we even have a look at electric cars, we must first consider
available infrastructure we have to fuel them. Already, Australia is
internationally miles ahead of at least half the world when it comes
to the strength of our household power networks. This is principally
due to our higher distribution voltage : 240/415v.

In Australia, our premises (homes and businesses) use electricity for
more and wider applications than most overseas countries do. A very
large proportion of our homes are “all electric.” As a result, our
domestic networks have been designed around the higher energy density
and lower diversity that comes with using electricity for things like
water and space heating. Overseas homes generally use older, dirty
fuel based options for these tasks such as coal, oil and natural gas.

Not withstanding the diminishing number of older and un renovated
premises built before the wiring rules of 1976 were adopted, the lions
share of our modern homes and businesses in Australia today are
supplied with either a 230 volt, 80 Amp single phase supply or a 415
volt, three phase 63 Amp supply. Compared with overseas, a
disproportionately large number of Australian homes have a three phase
supply connected. Overseas, this is practically unheard of. Virtually
impossible in 120v countries.

The figures above denote the maximum amount of electricity that can be
drawn by a premises before the main fuse blows. Ignoring things like
power factor (which we’ll assume as being ideal at 1.0 so as to not
confuse you too much), the absolute maximum amount of energy that can
be supplied through these connections at any one time is as follows;

Distribution system diversity

Before we delve further inside your house, first lets have a look at
what’s going on outside in the street. Regardless of whether your area
is serviced by overhead or underground power, every block or around 60
houses you’ll find a distribution transformer which supplies 230/415v
from the local 11kV networks. In suburban Australia, these are usually
of a capacity around 400kW.

Now if we consider that each of these sixty single phase houses are
able to pull a maximum of 18.4kW from the supply, we find that
transformer really should be 1104kW—not a mere 400kW. In fact if we
consider that at least half of those houses probably have three phase
supplies connected, this maximum adds up to a whopping 1806kW. We
haven’t even considered business premises yet!

The reason our lights stay on without the distribution transformer
exploding, is because of diversity. This works on the assumption that
all premises are not going to be pulling the maximum amount of power
out of the network all at the same time.

Even on the hottest day of the year when air conditioning demand is
maxed out, there will probably be at least one third of these houses
standing empty with demand at virtually zero. Of the remainder, the
air conditioning load still represents only a fraction of the total
power each house can potentially draw from the network.

So if we have 60 houses (20 of them empty) and each of the other 40
houses running two large 4kW split air conditioners flat out on a 48
degree day, this still adds up to only 320kW. Even in this demand peak
situation, our 400kW distribution transformer is more than capable of
providing electricity to all sixty houses. The electricity
distribution companies regularly monitor the demand on their
distribution transformers by reading the “maximum demand indicators”
attached to each transformer. If these MDI’s routinely begin to show
that a transformer is becoming overloaded, the company must then
invest in a “network upgrade.” This can either involve swapping the
transformer out for a bigger one, or installing another transformer
further down the road and dividing the sixty houses across the two.

Domestic loads, “peak” and “off peak”

Back in the middle of last century and well before rooftop solar was
even a dream, the power companies had a dilemma. The coal fired plants
they use to supply energy to the network are very inefficient when
they’re not working at near full capacity. Engineering wise, it’s very
difficult to “wind up” and “wind down” a large coal fired plant to
meet the fluctuating demands of the network. A coal plant running at
40% load gobbles almost the same amount of coal as it does if it were
running at 70% load.

Demand during the day and in to the evening was high. It would then
taper off to very low at night, after 10pm when business was closed
and everyone was asleep.  The intelligent solution of the day was to
take a look at existing loads on the network to see if it were
possible to prevent them from drawing power at peak times.

Demand during the day and in to the evening was high. It would then
taper off to very low at night, after 10pm when business was closed
and everyone was asleep.  The intelligent solution of the day was to
take a look at existing loads on the network to see if it were
possible to prevent them from drawing power at peak times.

With a typical load of 4.8kW per house, Australian “off peak” water
heating networks are immense.  There’s every reason to believe
Australia became a world leader in this regard. Even today, it takes
hundreds of megawatts of load off the network during the day and then
applies it at night, in return for very low energy costs to the
consumer. In most homes the 4.8kW “off peak” water heater is easily
the biggest load in the house. It also operates for the longest time -
typically 5~8 hours to heat a cold tank.

Considering our “sixty houses” example above, every night an
additional 288kW of load is going to be connected to our 400kW
distribution transformer at 10pm. Multiply this effect over whole
suburbs and cities… the effect of connecting hundreds of thousands of
water heaters to the national network at night is easily recognisable
on national electricity demand graphs today, especially in Winter.

Can you see a pattern developing here? A collusion against our
electric car?? Hmm…. We’ll come back to that later.

Now to our Electric Car

Currently, the energy for our road transport networks comes from
[dirty] fuels—mainly oil. The idea behind transitioning to an electric
transport future revolves around replacing this oil with electricity,
which in turn it is hoped might be created from non [polluting] fuel
sources. However when we dig beyond the “green gobbledegook” and
actually get our calculator out, we soon discover that this idea
simply can never work in any capacity - either now or in the future. A
universally adopted “electric car” will quickly result in astronomical
energy costs and spell the death of our already stressed national
electricity grid.

First, let’s consider our “electric car.” We haven’t included heavy
vehicles such as trucks and buses in our study just yet. Here, we’re
just going to consider the idea of replacing petrol and diesel driven
private cars and light commercial vehicles such as utes and SUV’s,
with electric.

For today’s calculations we’re going to use the Tesla Model 3. We can
consider this a “typical” modern electric car for the purpose of
calculating charging power and time against distance travelled for a
“light vehicle” under two tonnes. Obviously charging power required by
larger electric vehicles serving the needs of SUV and Light Truck
users will be considerably more—however we can take the Tesla Model 3
as being generally representative for our calculations.

Lets start by setting the parameters of our study:

- In typical usage, the lions share of car owners both business and
private, will want to use their car during the day and then charge it
at home during the night, ready for use the next day.

- Although the typical average daily Australian commute distance is
only 16km, the typical travel distance for a private car in Australia
is around 20,000km per year. Assuming the car travels nowhere on at
least 1/4 of days in that year, this means the “average” electric car
will be expected to travel around 73km per day.

- Given typical Australian usage patterns, it can be expected that on
some days, owners will want to be able to have the option of using
their electric car over far longer distances. These will likely extend
upwards to the limits of vehicle range. In the case of the Tesla Model
3 this averages at around 402km.

- There are several levels of “home” charging available for the Tesla
Model 3. Quoted from their web site, the table below outlines the
charging options available. The column outlines the number of
kilometres a vehicle could be expected to run after one hour of
charging at the nominated rate

- For accuracy, we also have to consider the number of vehicles in our
study. Typically most suburban households in Australia have at least
two cars, sometimes three. If each of these is expected to be used
during the day, all of them will need to be charged at night at the
same premises.

- Considering the above, a reasonable expectation will be that a
typical “all electric car” household will probably invest in one large
“wall” charger of 7.4 or 11kW capacity, plus also use one or several
smaller chargers of 3.7kW and 2.3kW concurrently for the second, third
or visiting vehicles. The vehicle with the most depleted battery and
which runs the greatest distance, will use the wall charger, while the
others will likely be “topped up” using smaller charging options.

In search of a “typical example,” we’re going to take an average 3
bedroom suburban house with a single phase 80A supply. Typical “all
electric” home with solar hot water (4.8kW electric booster), one air
conditioner.. and two electric cars. Both are used for daily commutes
of around 98km and 24km respectively. Weekend trips of up to 150km can
be for either car. An elder son of the family also owns an electric
car. He lives away during the week and often returns home on weekends
and needs to charge his car at that time.

It’s a rainy, winter’s Friday night. All three cars are hooked up to
charge. The air con is on, warming the house. The solar water heater
booster is also on after everyone has had a shower. It switches in
when the off peak rate starts at 10pm. The typical demand is;

- 32A to charge the main car
- 16A to charge the second car
- 10A to charge the third car
- 12A for the air conditioner
- 20A for the water heater
- 5A for other small loads around the house. 

A total of 95 amps.

In the dark... at around 10:15pm... the call is put to the electricity
company to come and replace the main fuse.

Again...

The Bigger Picture

We could go on for ages with these examples. However let’s now go back
to considering those sixty houses we were talking about at the start
of this paper. Let’s start by assuming that all of the single phase
houses have now been progressively upgraded to three phase, as owners
buy electric cars and have electricians install chargers in their
garages. Instead of around 5kW, night demand for each house now
averages at something around 12kW.

As a result, the so called “off peak” demand on our poor 400kW
transformer shoots up to something like 720kW. The power company has
to fork out around $600,000 to split the load to a new transformer at
the other end of the street, now leaving around 30 houses on each
transformer.

To handle the tripling of the “night” load, the power company now has
to do the same thing with their 11kV network. They begin to insert
additional zone substations in between the existing ones at around $50
million a pop. Magnified across the whole country, this augmentation
cost quickly spirals into billions of dollars. The power companies
have to pay for all this somehow.. and guess what?

That’s right! They do it by increasing electricity charges!

Under these conditions, the “demand curves” and pricing structures of
last century around which our existing networks were built, get turned
on their head. The cheapest time to buy electricity is now in the
middle of a sunny day, when roof top solar is churning out thousands
of surplus megawatts.

The most expensive time to buy power is in the evening when there is
no solar capacity at all.  Everybody returns home to cook a meal,
switch on the air conditioner and connect their car to the charging
outlet. Demand “peaks” in the late evening and then stays high
throughout the night until the car charge loads are removed from the
network in the morning.

As a result, the concept of having a cheap rate for night time “off
peak” power quickly becomes nonsense.  The power companies begin to
charge much higher rates at night, only dropping to a low “off peak”
rate for just a few hours in the middle of the day when all that
rooftop solar is producing excess electricity.  Power costs,
especially for those using electricity for water heating, suddenly
shoot through the roof!

The cost advantages of owning an electric car under these conditions
become quickly eroded. It becomes cheaper to just buy petrol than to
charge an electric car at home. To make matters worse, due to less
petrol being sold, the government is now losing millions in fuel
excise tax - as cars shift from petrol to electric. In order to
maintain road maintenance budgets, new taxes are introduced on
electricity and electric car charging, to “level the economic playing
field.” This pushes up power costs even further...

Fast Chargers and Public Charging Networks

Until now, we’ve mentioned little about other options available for
charging [EV]. However there are some. This growing network of “public
chargers” is designed to take the place of local service stations.

These “public chargers” are very high capacity units—typically over
80kW each. They connect directly to the DC batteries in the car
instead of relying on the smaller AC charger located within the car
itself. Typical charge times can be around 30 minutes..

Do the electrical maths.. and we quickly discover the nasty sting in
the tail of these units! For Tesla’s fleet, there are two models
available:

- A 50kW unit, which can charge from 20% to 80% in about 45 minutes.
- A whopping 150kW unit, which can charge from 20% to 80% in about 20 minutes.

A single 50kW charger demands about 80 Amps per phase from the
network. This is more than the entire capacity available in a typical
domestic three phase connection! The killer 150kW unit will need a
circuit breaker no smaller than 200 Amps per phase at the meter
board.. And this is just to charge ONE Car!!!

A “charging centre” typically consisting of just eight of the 150kW
units, would require an 11kV substation on site capable of delivering
around one megawatt! To put this in to perspective, a substation of
this size would typically be employed to supply energy to an entire
medium sized suburban shopping centre. These are truly astronomical
figures—and certainly not the kind of installation you can expect to
just “drop in” to any existing suburban location without very
substantial and expensive network augmentation.

Remember… the installation has to be dimensioned with very low
diversity. The reality of all chargers operating at full power on a
regular basis is very high.

For a brief moment, let’s form a picture in our mind of charging
stations like this “popping up” everywhere, all around suburban
[country]. Literally hundreds of them—potentially thousands—in a city
the size of Sydney or Melbourne. Then... Lets read on... below….

We’ve taken a look at what happens at home. We’ve considered that in
order to provide for home charged electric cars on a wide scale, local
power networks will need to be augmented by a factor of at least three
and that the delicate balance of electricity bill shock is very likely
to suffer as a consequence—even to the extent that “fueling” electric
cars may end up becoming more expensive than with the existing petrol
and diesel fleet.

Even if we were to somehow deal with all the enormous problems above
and electric cars somehow remained viable, we still need to consider
their effect on the national electricity market. Unlike many other
electrical loads, electric cars represent load on our network with
very low diversity. By definition of the way we use our cars, charging
them will generate enormous peak loads on our electricity network at
night, just the same as our cars now cause peak hour chaos on road
networks every weekday morning.

For the first time since the introduction of “off peak” electric water
heating, we’re planning to make a seismic change to the way we use
electricity. Only this time, it’ll be by factors tenfold of those that
were made previously.

Everyone wants to connect their cars to their charger at the same time
at night. This load will remain for hours instead of minutes. The
network will need to be robust enough to provide for this additional
load on top of all the existing loads already on our network. Unlike
with the off peak water heaters, there’s no real scope for us to take
existing loads and shift them to another time.

Each and every single electric car “added” to the network represents
addition of a significant load that previously wasn’t there at
all. This means to calculate the effect on say, the NSW electricity
network is quite easy:

NSW’s average electricity consumption at 10pm at night currently
hovers around the 7,300 megawatts mark. The absolute maximum demand
hovers around 13,500 megawatts on the hottest work days of the year.

Back in 2015 the ABS reported there were 5,247,199 registered vehicles
in NSW, of which around 60% (or 3,673,039) were cars or light
commercials. If we investigate a reasonable “electric car” penetration
rate of about one third of this total, that should give us a snapshot
of what things might be like when we have around 1,212,102 electric
vehicles in NSW.

To keep things realistic, we’ll also assume that only one third of
these will be “on charge” each night.  The other third will either be
on the road being driven, at their destination, or otherwise not
needing charge. That delivers just under 400,000 cars which will
likely be connected and charging at 10pm each week night.

Inevitably, some will probably be connected using slower “standard
power outlet” style chargers. Others will be connected using fast,
three phase chargers. The difference should therefore be more or less
equal to the mean in the middle. For our calculations we can assume
then, that each car is connected to a standard single phase wall
charger and that this is operating at around 7.4kW.

Using these simple and very conservative calculations, we can see that
this will add an extra 2,960 megawatts of load to the NSW network
around 10pm. To put this in perspective, the entire maximum output of
Mount Piper Power Station, NSW’s newest (1983) coal fired plant, is a
mere 1,400MW. So it’s reasonable to see that in simple terms at least,
NSW would need to add at least two more “Mount Pipers” just to keep up
with this demand.

The mathematics gets positively horrifying when we start to apply this
seismic shift in load profile to the proposed “renewable” generation
presented in AEMO’s “ISP report”. To provide for this kind of daily
capacity without resorting to fossil fuel base load, would require
hundreds of billions of dollars of additional investment in network
infrastructure. It will need further hundreds of billions of dollars
in the actual generating assets themselves like solar and wind—if it
is even possible to use these sources to provide such energy
continuously for the eight hours or so that the charging loads will be
drawing power from the network.

There simply isn’t enough suitable land in NSW on which such massive
solar or wind plants could even be established, without significantly
impacting on our national parks and existing agriculture. There is
nowhere near enough water in any river system capable of supporting
the kind of “pumped hydro” capacity that would be needed to deliver
this kind of dispatchable capacity... ALL NIGHT.

If we even suggest using “grid scale battery” technology, we would
need an installation more than thirty times the size of South
Australia’s so called “Elon Musk” battery plant. Even then there would
be no guarantee that enough energy could even be stored in it to last
the eight or so hours it would take to charge 400,000 vehicles
overnight and also cover for winter or cloudy days at the solar farms.

<a name='losses'></a>

Of course the other thing we’ve neglected to include in our
calculations, is the issue of network losses. As any electrical
engineer will tell you—all electricity networks have losses. For every
kilowatt we put in to the NSW network we’re lucky to get about 900
watts out of the other end. Over multiple interstate links this can be
as low as 700w. So in reality, our electric cars will add a demand of
around 3,250 megawatts. It would be like the network is running on a
hot summer work day.. but every night of the week.

This means that NSW would need to find an extra 3,250 megawatts of
reliable, base load generation in order to allow approximately one
third of the existing car fleet to be converted to electric. These
calculations were simple, conservative and based on measured load as
provided by electric car manufacturers. However the future in this
regard gets even more scary once we start considering some of those
other aspects we conveniently “left out” of our “simple” models;

Heavier Vehicles..

As of yet, the charging current draw for the Tesla Semi is not quoted
on their web site. However it can be expected that a charger capacity
of around 1MW per truck could be expected. A typical transport yard
might see six or eight of these on charge at a time—over 8MW—and
likely needing at least a 33kV supply into the yard!

Even conversion of only 20% of our current truck fleet to electric
would inevitably add thousands more megawatts of load to the
electrical grid—at all hours of both day and night.

Then there’s electric buses—already a reality in many countries. The
NSW Government recently announced a program to acquire over 8000 new
electric buses to replace it’s ageing diesel fleet.

These buses use batteries of around 330kWh capacity and consume around
80kW per hour under normal driving conditions. Buses typically operate
for long hours during the day, which means the pressure will be on to
provide very high capacity for charging them at night.

We don’t need to be a rocket scientist to work out that each bus will
need access to a charger of at least 100kW, running continuously all
night, in order to charge it ready for the next day’s service.  With a
typical depot containing well over 100 buses…. that’s at least 10MW
per depot.

NSW’s fleet of “8000 new buses” will effectively require the power
output of yet another Mount Piper generator to charge each night.
