<h1>The Big Bang</h1>
<h3>JWST</h3>
<p>The findings of JWST provided incontrovertible proof against the Big Bang theory.</p>
<p>Michio Kaku: "The James Webb Telescope is upsetting the apple
cart. All of a sudden we realize that we may have to rewrite all of
the textbooks about the beginning of the universe. It takes many
billions of years to create a galaxy like the Milky Way galaxy with a
hundred billion stars many billions of years old, but the James Webb
Telescope has identified six galaxies that exist half a billion years
after the big bang that are up to 10 times bigger than the Milky Way
galaxy. That shouldn't have happened. There should not be primordial
galaxies that are bigger than the Milky Way galaxy that are only half
a billion years old. Something is wrong, we may have to revise our
theory of the creation of the universe"</p>
<h3>The Herouni Antenna, CMB</h3>
<p><a href="http://elib.sci.am/2007_1/10_1_2007.pdf">Paper</a></p>
<p>The first in the World Radio-Optical Telescope ROT-54/2.6 was designed
and built during 1975-1985 by Radiophysics Research Institute (RRI,
Yerevan, Armenia) on territory of RRI Aragats Scientific Centre (ASC,
100 ha) on Mount Aragats (Armenia) at altitude 1700m...</p>
<p>[An] important question is what means so low Self Noises (2,6 K or 2,8
K). According to the theory of the Big Bang in Universe it must have
been Relict radiation of 2,7 K.  If it is right, then our measured
noises near Zenith had to be 2,6+2,7=5,3K.  But they are absent. It is
also impossible that our 2,6 K is 2,7 K of Relict. Because it will be
only in case, if our Antenna is ideal and its Self Noises are equal 0
K.  But it is impossible on Earth. So there is only one explanation,
that Relict radiation is absent in Universe, and.. there never was any
Big Bang in Universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=16LCitZcCeddAAyuVILc8qxHo7g7dL5X9">Paper</a></p>
<p>The main purpose of this article is to concentrate on.. the very low
level of Self Noises of ROT Antenna...</p>
<p>This very low level of our measured self noises of ROT Antenna rises
the query to well known cosmogonic theory of “Big Bang”. According to
this theory it has to be in Universe the uniform relict background
having level of about 3K (2.7K) in waverange 8mm.  This was confirmed
experimentally by A.Pensias and R.Wiliams (USA) who in 1965 had
measured the self noises of hom antenna and received 6K. As
theoretically it is considered that self noises of hom antenna have to
be about 3K, it was decided that the rest 3K is relict background (for
what they even were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978).</p>
<p>But the presented above result of our measurements shows that either
this 2.8K is a relict background, then self noises of ROT Antenna is
equal zero.. or this is self noises of Antenna, and then the relict
background is absent (or almost absent). In this case it has sense to
return to the earlier “quantes ageing” theory which explains also the
known “red shift”.</p>
<h3>Eric Lerner</h3>
<p>Big Bang supposedly occurred only about twenty billion years ago,
nothing in the cosmos can be older than this. Yet in 1986 astronomers
discovered that galaxies compose huge agglomerations a billion
light-years across; such mammoth clusterings of matter must have taken
a hundred billion years to form [3].</p>
<p>[Answering the question 'can you save the Big Bang Theory by tweaking
it' outlines the problems with the approach an listing gross mistakes
of the BBT. First is] too little helium..  a very basic prediction of
The BBT which is that there should be a certain amount of helium
produced by Fusion reactions during the Big Bang and there should be
more helium and older in stars that have processed hydrogen.. but
observations have shown that in nearby stars and even in planetary
nebula.. where we can observe helium directly the amount of helium is
only half what's predicted by the [BBT]..</p>
<p><a name='homogeneous'></a></p>
<p>What's worrying.. Big Bang cosmologists is that the very basic
assumption of [the theory] is that the universe is homogeneous and
isotropic modulus.. Isotropic means the same in every direction.
Without those basic assumptions there would be no expanding universe
there would be no BB. General relativity only predicts an expanding or
contracting universe if the universe is homogeneous and isotropic
which has never been observed and today with even better observations
there are more and more anisotropies. When we look in different
directions in the sky we get different measurements, for example of
the Hubble constant, the constant that describes the relationship
between redshift and distance, we get different densities of radio
galaxies of X-ray galaxies of quasars. All of these are different in
different directions [leading to] lopsided star maps and therefore
again contradict the basic hypotheses of the BB...</p>
<p>[Another problem is] too little lithium; this again is the well-known
lithium problem, the BB makes predictions about three light elements,
helium, lithium and deuterium which is the heavy isotope of ordinary
hydrogen. The lithium it gets wrong entirely.. observations of lithium
are 20 times less than the predictions of the BB - a gross
contradiction...</p>
<p>If an airline advertises that out of the last 17 flights 16 crashed
and one got through would you fly on that airline? I think the answer
is obvious, and the answer to the question [of tweaking BB to save it]
is also obvious, with 16 wrong answers and one right answer this isn't
a theory that needs to be tweaked, this is a theory that needs to be
thrown away.</p>
<h3>Penrose</h3>
<p>RP said "When you plot CMB intensity against each frequency you get
Planck blackbody curve that means early universe must have had thermal
equilibrium. But thermal equilibrium means by definition maximum
random state... ". Wasn't the universe supposed to <em>toward</em> disorder,
and not start from one?</p>
