# Dark Energy

[Wolfgang Kundt](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3151)

‘Dark energy’ is the name introduced by Mike Turner, for what had been
called the ‘Λ term’, or ‘cosmological term’ in Einstein’s field
equations for more than half a century, a term that had no obvious
physical meaning – at least not in the laboratory – but that could not
be rejected either from the cosmological field equations if one was
looking for the most general second-order equations derivable from a
scalar Lagrangean. During the last decade, measurements with
increasing accuracy of the present average cosmic expansion signalled
an increasing expansion rate of the substratum – an acceleration – in
obvious violation of energy conservation: An expanding cloud of
self-gravitating objects should decelerate. This misbehaviour of
cosmological kinematics urged Turner to introduce his cryptic – and
even somewhat misleading – name ”dark energy” for the Λ-term: Λ does
not correspond to an energy density because it exerts a negative
pressure, forbidden by the classical energy inequalities for
laboratory substance (e.g. Kundt 1972); it is a non-energy, or at best
a quasi-energy.

For this reason, it struck me as a salvation of (serious) cosmology
when I read about David Wiltshire’s dismissing dark energy (Wiltshire
2007a,b, Ellis 2008). His thesis is simple and convincing: Cosmology
had hitherto been evaluated wrongly, by ignoring the inhomogeneous
distribution of its substratum. We know Shapiro’s ‘time delay’ effect
in the solar system, and in close neutron-star binaries: Signals
passing close to heavy objects (stars, galaxies) reach a distant
observer with a certain delay. In the same vein, when we measure
cosmic expansion, we use light rays which have propagated through an
inhomogenous Universe, with voids and walls, sometimes propagating
through near- vacuum patches (voids), and sometimes skimming heavy
mass concentrations (clusters of galaxies, in the walls). Clearly, the
formulae derived for a homogeneous cosmological model cannot be
expected to describe our observations correctly, due to
non-linearities.  Our local time scale, described by our (timelike)
worldline, inside our (massive) Galaxy, has to be referred to the
average cosmic timescale via intersections with successive null
geodesics lying on past light cones, and connecting us to distant
sources in the past.  There is no a priori reason why these two
timescales should be the same. A deviation is expected, an
acceleration, whose sign we must calculate, and whose magnitude must
likewise be calculated. It is a cumulative effect, to be obtained by
integration over large spacetime distances. Wiltshire has done such
calculations, and claims that their result describes the observed
seemingly accelerated expansion, without a Λ-term in the field
equations. All we have to do is evaluate our observations rigorously.
