# Dark Matter

The current cosmological model only works by postulating the existence
of dark matter – a substance that has never been detected, but that is
supposed to constitute approximately 25% of all the universe. But a
simple test suggests that dark matter does not in fact exist. If it
did, we would expect lighter galaxies orbiting heavier ones to be
slowed down by dark matter particles, but we detect no such
slow-down. A host of other observational tests support the conclusion:
dark matter is not there. The implications of this are nothing short
of a revision of Einstein’s theory of gravitation. Why the scientific
community is in denial about the falsification of the dark matter
model is a question that requires both a sociological and
philosophical explanation.

The severity of the mass discrepancy in spiral galaxies is strongly
correlated with the central surface brightness of their
disks. Progressively lower surface brightness galaxies have ever
larger mass discrepancies. No other parameter (luminosity, size,
velocity, morphology) is so well correlated with the magnitude of the
mass deficit.

The rotation curves of low surface brightness disks thus provide a
unique data set with which to probe the dark matter distribution in
galaxies. The mass discrepancy is apparent from R = 0, giving a nearly
direct map of the halo mass distribution. The luminous mass is
insignificant.

Interpreting the data in terms of dark matter leads to troublesome
fine-tuning problems. Different observations require contradictory
amounts of dark matter. Structure formation theories are as yet far
from able to explain the observations.

It is astonishing that there is a deep mystery and controversy about
something as apparently simple as the dynamics of our galaxy, the
Milky Way. This is not a problem with something esoteric like quantum
field theory or general relativity, this is a problem at the level of
simple high school physics, ie, Newton’s laws and gravity. It is not
about disagreements between theory and experiment of fractions of a
percent, but, rather, 5-to-10-fold errors.

I am referring to the problem of the rate of the rotational velocity
of gases at the outer fringes of spiral galaxies.  The steady state
rotational velocity is the resultant of the balance between the
centrifugal force and the gravitational force from the mass of the
rest of the galaxy. The observed velocity is greater by a factor of
two or more than is predicted from Newton’s laws and the known
experimental mass density of the stars, gases and dust. To account for
this using standard Newtonian theory, it is necessary to postulate
that there is some extra missing mass, representing about 75% of the
total galaxy gravitational mass, that is made of some exotic
particle(s) referred to as “cold dark matter” (CDM). Despite enormous
experimental efforts to directly detect CDM, representing hundreds of
sophisticated searches using everything from the large hadron collider
at CERN to exotic underground detectors, all have come up with
absolutely nothing..
