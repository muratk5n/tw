# Oumuamua

There are two theories on the mysterious object Oumuamua. Scientist
Avi Loeb claims it is extraterrestrial, another, after their first
hydrogen iceberg claim was debunked, hydrogen bubbles forming in
regular ice. The latter theory starts with the fact that H2 outgassing
is not currently detected by any latest device, and hence it could be
the culprit for the acceleration witnessed with Oumuamua. Both views
are presented below.

### Extraterrestrial

*Extraterrestrial*, Avi Loeb

For starters, prior to Oumuamua’s discovery, no confirmed interstellar
object had ever been observed in our own solar system. That alone made
Oumuamua historic, and it was enough to draw many astronomers’
attention..

And once we had our telescopes trained on Oumuamua, we looked for one
bit of information in particular: how Oumuamua reflected sunlight.
Our Sun acts like a lamppost that illuminates not only all the planets
orbiting it but every object that comes close enough.. [A]ny two
objects will rotate relative to each other when they pass... Anything
other than a sphere, however, will reflect the Sun’s light by varying
amounts as the object rotates. A football, for example, will reflect
more light when one of its long sides faces the Sun and less light
when, as it tumbles, its narrow sides face the Sun.  For
astrophysicists, an object’s changing brightness provides invaluable
clues to its shape. In the case of Oumuamua, the object’s brightness
varied tenfold every eight hours, which we deduced to be the amount of
time that it took to complete one full rotation. This dramatic
variability in its brightness told us that Oumuamua’s shape was
extreme, or at least five to ten times longer than it was wide.  This
would make Oumuamua’s geometry more extreme.. than the most extreme
asteroids or comets that we have ever seen...

[T]he object’s relatively small but extreme dimensions—with a length
at least five to ten times greater than its width—allowed only two
possible shapes. Our interstellar visitor was either elongated, like a
cigar, or flat, like a pancake.. Either way, Oumuamua was a
rarity. If it was elongated, we had never seen any naturally occurring
space object that size and that elongated; if it was flat, we had
never seen any naturally occurring space object that size and that
flat.

And there was more.. In addition to being small and oddly shaped,
Oumuamua was strangely luminous.. [with] levels of brightness similar
to a shiny metal.

Oumuamua.. trajectory deviated from what was expected based on the
Sun’s gravitational force alone. There was no obvious explanation for
why. This, for me, was the most eyebrow-raising bit of data..  The
universal laws of physics allow us to predict with certainty what a
given object’s trajectory should be as it speeds around the Sun. But
Oumuamua didn’t behave as we expected.

Comets [can] show a [similar] deviation.. The comet’s evaporating ice
acts like a jet that pushes the comet. Because of that rocket effect,
an outgassing comet can deviate from a path shaped by the Sun’s
gravitation alone. Indeed, when astronomers observe such a comet, we
can be precise. When we see an outgassing comet and measure the extent
of its deviation, we can calculate how much of the comet’s mass was
used up in giving it this extra push. But deep observations of the
space around Oumuamua did not reveal any trace of water, carbon-based
gases, or dust, ruling out the possibility that it was being pushed by
cometary vapor or visible dust particles. Moreover, it did not change
its spin rate as it should have if one-sided jets were pushing it
sideways, as they often do in comets...

And then there is the evidence that the extra force acting on
Oumuamua, the force that was causing it to deviate, declined in
inverse proportion to the square of Oumuamua’s distance from the
Sun. If the extra force were the result of outgassing, we would expect
a faster deceleration of an object as it rapidly distances itself from
the Sun.. When I read reports that the extra force on Oumuamua
declined inversely with the distance from the Sun squared, I wondered
what could be pushing it if not outgassing or disintegration. The only
explanation that came to mind was the sunlight bouncing off its
surface like wind off a thin sail.

### Hydrogen Gas

[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/science/astronomy-oumuamua-comet.html)

[L]ab experiments done as far back as the 1970s showed that when ice
is struck by high-energy particles, its molecules can break apart,
leaving tiny bubbles of hydrogen gas trapped several meters deep in
the ice. “A comet traveling through the interstellar medium basically
is getting cooked by cosmic radiation, forming hydrogen as a result"...

"As the ice is warmed, it rearranges to a more stable and compact
structure.. [t]his process.. leads to the collapse of these pockets
and the formation of channels within the ice, through which trapped
gas can escape... For a normal-size comet, this release of gas would
have a negligible effect.. But because Oumuamua was so small, we think
that it actually produced sufficient force to power this acceleration"
