We show that European countries and Europe as a whole are more equal than the US

The question is: why? 

We take a fresh look at this [below]"

Design of a floating platform. Foam is surrounded by concrete, further
supported by steel. Foam supplies the low density (gives volume minus
weight), concrete makes sure the water never gets in. Solid design.

"War [as in culture], as rhetoric, emphasizes the clash rather than
the cause. If you can move the conversation toward the war itself, you
might give people permission to forget why the battle is being waged
in the first place. And you might be able to shift the terms of the
discussion away from the sweeping failures of the federal government
and toward the familiar reductions of the culture war. You can erode
the matter down to the basics of 'personal responsibility' versus
'governmental intrusion'"

of this computer means it can use extremely sophisticated in-house
algorithms to process subsoil data. The geophysical and seismic
information we collect from all over the world is sent to HPC5 for
processing. Using this data, the system develops extremely in-depth
subsoil models, and on the basis of these, we can determine what is
hidden many kilometres below the surface: indeed, this is how we found
Zohr, the largest gas field ever discovered in the Mediterranean"

Not just powerful enough, RPi can *be* desktop out-of-the-box.

Take the SD card (with OS on it), stick it in. Connect RPi to HDMI
monitor. Connect USB keyboard / mouse. Boom! Right there, you have now

spreadsheet, edit programming languages, view videos, right away. All
through a light, tiny board.

"You say RPi can replace desktop machine. Do you mean it is powerful enough to do that?"

"The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust determined Facebook
wields monopoly powers in social network and has maintained its
position by acquiring, copying or killing its competitors, according
to a report the group released on Tuesday.

The report from the Democratic majority staff, which also addresses
antitrust concerns regarding Amazon, Apple, Google parent-company
Alphabet, recommends that Congress review a series of potential
remedies. This includes “structural separation,” which could require
the companies to split parts of their businesses. For instance,
Facebook could be forced to divest or operationally separate
photo-sharing service Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp, both of
which it acquired"

DJT net approval back down to -10%. If this continues throughout Oct I
call it a sure lose.

---

Sure. Just like state colleges compete with private ones today.

"If enacted the government wld be creating 'the school' digitally and
be competing with other commercial schools, universities"

---

It's plenty! I have [this course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
stored on my hard drive, and it takes 2.5 GB with 20+ videos, code,
lecture notes in PDF.

Disk space is cheap. In fact disk space is the first thing that went
ultra-cheap in the computing revolution.

"But is 64 GB disk space enough?"

---

I cannot stress this enough. That little RPi board has a full blown
Linux on it, it can run Python, or any language, browser, spreadsheet,
any program that can run on a notebook, desktop.

---

Let's create an ed machine. RPi can be a desktop / notebook replacement. 

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/) $35.

Micro Sd Card 64 GB $20.

7 inch 1024*600 LCD HDMI [monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Inch-Monitor-HDMI-SunFounder/dp/B01J51CXU4) $70.

[Wireless keyboard + mouse](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/logitech-k400-plus-wireless-keyboard-black/7575039.p?skuId=7575039)
combo, $25.

This is a full-blown computer for ~ $140. I belive monitors can be had
for cheaper, if the buyer was buying in bulk.

---

Every kid will need a personal tablet / notebook of course.

---

Even if Internet was available everywhere, I'd still implement synch
feature. Student syncs their lecture content with central, or a closer
school server. They need to have all necessary files with them.

---

Once "classes" turn into just content and a few administrators, you
could house regional, town level servers, which can be clones of the
central DoEd server. Individual schools can get the classes they need
on smaller disks to distribute them to kids at schools /
homes. Student goes to a "data access point", gets his "class" and
either goes home, or school (if possible by this point due to
pandemic).

"Not every school can have distance learning, bcz they dont have Internet"

---

It makes total sense, for gigantic amount of data, hauling hard drives
can be faster.

Respect the offline. The physical. The classical.

---

"Yes, today's speediest internet connections make it faster to download
movies than to go to the store and buy them. But downloading or
uploading truly large amounts of data can still take days, months, or
even years—think a film studio's entire video archives or the
satellite imagery collections of government agencies. That lag is a
problem for Amazon, which wants companies to store their information
in its lucrative cloud. But it's also a natural one for Amazon—a
logistics company at heart—to solve. So this week the company
announced one of its strangest ideas yet: a tractor trailer that will
transport your data to Amazon's own data centers. (Insert information
superhighway joke here.)"

They cannot do it at a scale government can. Gov already has access to
best researchers through their grant programs. They can make ed
content a requirement as part of a grant process. Plus there is the
aspect of "your country needs you". I think a lot of good teachers
would go for that, even select teachers outside the university system. 

"There are commercial, virtual universities who do this"

---

YT content is just too fragmented to create a digital school with. For
every country / language, lecturer need to be identified, for each
subject, get a content creator / programmer assigned to, and have them
generate a course.

"But Feynman videos are on YouTube now, they are also many other good
teachers on vid. Can't students just go to YouTube?"

---

No bcz he won't be responsible for teaching an entire class
anymore. Won't have any administrative work, all he'll have to do is
to show up, be around, and handle certification if a student asks for
it which will be rare. Certifier will know a particular lecture
content (he himself is certified on) inside and out of course, so in
effect he is also a student, just a more experienced one. This is very
important, this person will not deliver a lecture. Richard Freaking
Feynman is your teacher now, or whowever is at his caliber nowadays,
on a given course. There is always that freak of nature who is part
teacher part researcher, equally awesome on both. Gov finds that guy /
gal, gets the content, so a poor student won't have to settle with Bob
Buttfuck from Bumblefuck, they'll have the best on video, in lecture
materials as PDFs, offline viewable HTML with animation etc.

"So your proposal [on ed](../../2018/09/public-education.html) creates 'a
certifier' and does away with teachers. Certifier will sit in
classrooms, will be able to answer questions. But will s/he not be
overloaded?"

SS is responsible for foreign policy, its intent, execution, and one
clear adminstrative work they do is running the embassies. And spies
usually assume a diplomat cover, and/or need the embassy as a
go-through point. Ergo, SS can allow / deny certain individuals, spies
perhaps in a country, influencing intelligence ops in that country,
effecting on-the-ground events. SecState matters.

It is concoction. Theather. Look; someone like Tucker Carlson, who
recently started to talk about some traditionally left issues (this is
how far, and low the Dems had fallen, their abandoned ideas were
picked up by others) is pretty big anti-abortion guy right? Well, but
his religion, Episcopalian, is not strictly anti-abortion. In fact
none of them are! This guy is the only one! He jokes about it.. and
the rest of the joke goes, there is only one other Presb, a woman who
is that way, and he is married to her. Now forget one side
"imploring", trying to "convince", "one up" the other side. Imagine
that hand that goes out in the world, weeds out all likely candidates
and picks the only Presbyterian *in the world* who is
anti-abortion.. You can't fight this. The stage is set. With a certain
line-up you will get a certain theather. Pre-determined. Now TS
exceeded his programming so to speak, talks about some other stuff,
and we love seeing Glenn Greenwald on Fox. But there is a certain
institutional setup in play here, which can't be fought by more
punditry from the "other side". There is serious money to be made from
it too.. So much of it in fact, even Tubers down the line have been
feasting on the left-overs for years!  Forget mainstream!

The game is agree on all primary issues, raise a ruckus on secondary
bullshit ones, on "4G" - Green, Gays, Guns, God. Richard Fucking Nixon
founded the EPA, but pfff, that's so yesterday. Up until a few years
not a single Republican would touch an environmental issue with a

True. US has [faux polarization](../../2018/05/polarization.html). 

Caitlin Johnstone: "When you look at US politics, it appears as though
there are two mainstream political factions that very strongly
disagree with one another. 'Divided' is a word that comes up a
lot. 'Polarized' is another. It is of course true that a whole lot of
emotion flows between these two factions, and most of it is indeed
negative. The hot topics of any given news cycle in America will
typically involve more than one story pertaining to the vitriolic
enmity between them.  But beneath all the hurled insults and heated
debates, these two factions are actually furiously agreeing with one
another. They’re agreeing the entire time"

"[A Penn State] team integrated water purification technology into a
new proof-of-concept design for a sea water electrolyzer ..
[Researcher states: 'T]he holy grail of producing hydrogen would be to
combine the sea water and the wind and solar energy found in coastal
and offshore environments'.

Despite the abundance of sea water, it is not commonly used for water
splitting. Unless the water is desalinated prior to entering the
electrolyzer — an expensive extra step — the chloride ions in sea
water turn into toxic chlorine gas, which degrades the equipment and
seeps into the environment.

To prevent this, the researchers inserted a thin, semipermeable
membrane, originally developed for purifying water in the reverse
osmosis (RO) treatment process. The RO membrane replaced the

"[The Internet Computer solution] Dfinity’s valuation soars to $9.5Bn
after revealing its governance system and token economics....  The NNS
now means the [IC] is feature complete. It represents a seminal moment
in the history of the internet. For the first time, internet services
will be governed in a completely independent, decentralized manner. It
is the technical solution to the systemic problems Big Tech has
created with its monopoly over the internet, a public utility that
should be completely open — bringing back the concept of the
programmable web. The NNS is the catalyst for the open internet we
were promised in the 1990s, and it ensures that the future of the
internet remains open and free.'"
