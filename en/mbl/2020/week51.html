<p>Why is the use of renewable fuel, even if produced from fossil,
preferable?</p>
<p>Easier enforcement.</p>
<p>Fossil fuel at the end-user can leak, emission more likely. Carmakers
can cheat (see the Volkswagen 2015 scandal).</p>
<p>But if gov encourages, enforces clean fuel production at the source,
even with CCS, or even better 100% clean production, then all the way
down the line, beginning, middle, the end, we know there can be no
leaks, no emissions. No need to police Volkswagen, or Honda, Toyota,
etc. their fuel-cell car will have no choice but be clean.</p>

<p>Working with hair-splitting detail as programmer, is much more intense
than, say, in social sciences bcz at the end of the day programmatic
concepts, however abstract at first, need to <em>compile</em>, i.e. accepted
by a software compiler to be turned into machine code. So programmers
in some ways have compilers in their heads, that does strict
checks. Obviously every spoken language has also syntactic rules, but
none that can be verified instantly, to its tiniest comma, and can be
executed on-demand. So we run the compiler in our heads before
submitting code to the machine, we want to see as little errors as
possible, which makes it a stringent task. Do it a long time, you
really want to see that rapping dog at the end of the day. .</p>

<p>At the end of the day, by and large, Feynman did science to compute
stuff. He liked doing that, and I believe this is the right attitude
to have, in general, even for ppl who are deep in the weeds of
theory. The attitude also jels well with the beginning of modern
science, Newton was an active computer.</p>

<p>BTW Morales, who did some good things in his country, also f--d up in
a way.. he went to referandum for term extension, lost, had their SC
to overturn it, then won the general election. Turns out there was no
fraud in either, but at that point there was a general "funkyness" in
the air, and ppl could make that case... The left needs to be careful
with this stuff. He should have stepped down, give the reins to the
next guy. And guess what, after bunch of unnecessary drama that is
exactly what happened.</p>

<p>A lot of humor shared here is the kind knowledge work fold decompress with;
after paying attn to hair splitting detail for an extended period of

<p><em>Riddick</em> 2013, such a gutsy movie. Who would bet an entire movie on

Its basically this guy and his dog, at first.. that's it. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Rapaport: "[B]oth solids and gases have well-developed theoretical
foundations, but there is no general theory of liquids. For solids,
theory begins by assuming that the atomic constituents undergo small
oscillations about fixed lattice positions; for gases, independent
atoms are assumed and interactions are introduced as weak
perturbations. In the case of liquids, however, the interactions are
as important as in the solid state, but there is no underlying ordered
structure to begin with"</p>
