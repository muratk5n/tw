Anyone know what happened with that @CDCgov Chief Data Officer job?
Put my name in for it a couple months ago, but never heard
anything. Hopefully they got somebody better for it? ... (and I really
don't mean "better" in any kind of sarcastic way - I just know that
the set of people qualified for that job is pretty limited, and I'm
legitimately hoping they found someone with subject matter expertise
who also knows how to manage a data program of that scale)"

Cornel West: "[I]n 313, and Christianity became the official religion
of the Roman Empire under Theodotius the First, his successor. And of
course, this is the same Roman Empire that put Jesus to death. So one
of the real ironies is here you have the cross, the bloody cross which
is the symbol of the night side of the Roman Empire. That's where
political prisoners were murdered, right? That same empire makes the
movement that comes out of the death of Christ, which is Christianity,
the official religion. So, you get diffusion of this religion with the
state and what we have today in the Christian right are Constantinian
Christians. They are imperial Christians. They have lost the prophetic
fervor of the very Jesus Christ that they proclaim as their savior"

"The PlayStation 4 may be the latest and greatest video game console,
but the chip from the original PlayStation has gone where no video
game console has gone before: To Pluto.

According to The Verge, the CPU from the original Sony video game
console was used in NASA's New Horizons space probe, that just did a
flyby of the distant planet.

The MIPS R3000 CPU was repurposed in 2006 by the space agency to “fire
thrusters, monitor sensors, and transmit data.” Now it’s traveled 3.6
billion miles through space. That’s a distance so vast, it’s pretty
much impossible to grasp the enormity of it by just reading a
sentence. ..

According to The Verge, NASA prefers reliability over power—and what’s
more tried and true than a CPU used in millions of PlayStation
consoles?"

Even if you were correct, that CH is doing well, and here I'll give

He is trying to say 'what if you are one of those countries who for
whatever reason do not have capable ppl at the helm but now you are
stuck, bcz u have no democracy, you cannot change them'.

The results [I shared](../../2016/11/why-is-democracy-better.html)
on democracy show clearly, with all things considered, overall,
democracy works, so by default countries should prefer that. I dont
think anyone can replicate China's freak experiment.

Excellent. If you were back at those times, there'd come a time,
within a span of ~50 yrs, before / after of the place would look
drastically different. Before would be carriages, slow life, hand-sewn
clothing, after, train, steam ships, manufactured clothing, much
faster life. Diff between two waves. They are always drastic.

Watched *Rampage* in a foreign language. Looked fine. No idea what
they talked about.

---

*The Atlantic*: "[In the show *Cops* t]he arrestees are often referred
to as 'bad guys,' and they get no backstory, no biography beyond what
they volunteer to the officers in front of them. They’re human beings
reduced to the sum of their rap sheets, or to their mental and
emotional state on the particular day that the cameras are
rolling. The cops don’t get much more by way of characterization,
although they occasionally throw out one-liners to the accompanying
cameramen to acknowledge the viewers at home.

I was reminded of this detail when Officer Tou Thao of the Minneapolis
Police Department cracked, 'This is why you don’t do drugs, kids,' to
the assembled crowd watching the killing of George Floyd in real
time. The line struck me as something someone might say if they had
grown up watching *Cops*, and had absorbed the show’s motifs as emblems
of police work. In *Cops*’ world, the police are by default the good
guys, because theirs is the only point of view the camera
follows. Fleeing suspects must be captured because—on *Cops*—they’re
always guilty of something. And the structure of the show’s acts,
punctuated by ad breaks, means that the good guys unfailingly capture
and overpower the bad guys in a matter of minutes.Never have these
qualities felt so out of touch.

That *Cops* was still in production shocked some people this week, given
how much it seemed like a relic of the late ’80s and ’90s, something
unearthed from a time capsule alongside The Tracey Ullman Show and the
'Just Say No' antidrug campaign. But that the series was finally
canceled by the Paramount Network, where it had moved after 25 seasons
on Fox, was less surprising"

Germany's culture code for itself is ORDNUNG. This is their
"body-image", how they see themselves, want to be. The code can
conjure up images of people walking in a single file, like automatons
but ORDER isn't necessarily that. It could simply be absence of
chaos. Also for an unchaotic process, you need to know the
fundamentals of a situation, then a system can be designed to handle
it. Take Berlin U-Bahn, there is no charge at the station
entrance. You just freely walk in hop on the train. You have to have a
ticket on you when you are on the train, but there is no stringent
check at early entrance. This speeds up entry, exits. There are / can
be checkers in the trains, enough of them that if you make a habit of
not paying you'll eventually get caught. So everyone buys a
ticket. No chaos.

responsibilities had to be delegated to a moderator, a town clerk, a
constable, and, at times, to special committees"
