<p>Corollary: True change happens top-down, not bottom-up.</p>
<hr />
<p>They can gauge whether they are doing good or bad and vote for the
'other' if bad (enough for democracy to work).</p>
<p>Spin is short term. Bad policies sink, good policies raise -- in the
long run, through their outcomes. If ur party is constantly putting up
bad policies, ppl might choose 'other' on you more than the next
guy. Also if major blocs are all failing constantly u might get the
occasional fascist who'll run roughshod over the whole thing. That,
noone wants.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="2015/09/the-logic-of-political-survival-mesquita.html#elections">Exactly</a>. People don't
know shit.  That's why you dont put them on the spot for specific
policy (see Brexit).  </p>
<p>"Are you saying you can 'spin' people? They are not wise processors of
information?"</p>
<hr />
<p>It could work.. the spin that is. Im not sure Dems want anything
passed that wld help Trump before election anyway.</p>
<p>"In many of the competitive races, Republicans have risked their seats
by jamming through the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney
Barrett [.. m]eanwhile, a desperately needed stimulus bill continues
to languish. This is precisely the message Senate Democrats used to
make the four-day Barrett hearings into a advertisement against Senate
Republicans"</p>

<p>Plug Power CEO: "Power Density and Range: fuel cell energy density is
four times more than batteries, and a tank of hydrogen contains more
than double the energy of a battery at the same weight. Fuel cells
allow easy scalability for users to increase range without the
elimination of cargo space. This is important in middle-mile and
long-haul green mobility markets.  In these applications, you must
double the batteries on board to double the range of a
battery-electric vehicle. With fuel cells, to double the range, you
only have to add more hydrogen.  That supports a 50-60% increase in
payload versus battery electric vehicles"</p>

<p>If one has certain <a href="2015/07/mesquita-game-theory.html#inborn">socdyn ability</a>,
an idea is to use it to find good anchor points, calculations, measurements, lit,
and use that to build more know-how around. Can lead to more replicatable
results and might even to something resembling science. I did this bcz
lack of mathematics in socials sciences is repulsive for 1, and wanted
to be as hands-off as possible (refs for everything). It works.</p>

<p>The Independent, 2015: "Schools are using 'dubious practices' and even
cheating to achieve better performance results because of the intense
pressure of the Government’s test and exam system, a major study for
the largest teaching union has found. ...</p>
<p>The study concluded there was 'evidence that teachers in England are
‘gaming the system’, because they are under pressure to achieve good
results. In some cases they are being told to cheat. Such practices
are increasing in response to the intense pressure on school leaders
and teachers to raise attainment as measured by tests and exams.'"</p>

<p>They discovered a method to produce a cheap catalyst that performs as
well as current methods, but based on tungsten.</p>
<p>"[E]lectrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as one of the
most important and sustainable processes for the hydrogen
production. Because of the low HER kinetics, it is necessary to use
high efficiency electrocatalysts to increase the overall process
efficiency. ...</p>
<p>Here, we report a simple and scalable plasma dynamic synthesis method
to form composite containing the single-crystalline nanosized cubic
tungsten carbide embedded in the carbon matrix (WC 1-x @C), which was
studied in HER both in the pure form and modified with some Pt by wet
impregnation method. It was found that even by adding 1 wt % platinum,
it is possible to significantly increase the catalytic activity of the
WC 1-x @C composite, while with the addition of 10% platinum allows
reaching almost the same properties as for commercial Pt/C sample"</p>

<p>There is no comparison. H2 storage capacity is nearly limitless. If
there is water, we can get H2. Double the panel capacity double the
fuel. As simple as that.</p>

<p>How to understand a certain country with dumb ni--rs at the helm..
You start with a child. What does a child want? Wants to do grown-up
things, right. Drive like one, be like one.</p>
<p><img width="340" src="https://cdn.cdnparenting.com/articles/2018/04/578115136-H.jpg"/></p>
<p>But if the child type is dysfunctional, s/he wont know what those
grown-up things are, will instead do things that <em>appear</em> grown-up,
like this kid, with imaginary steering wheel, and make car sounds
"wroomm wrooom". In gov that'll be vevy vevy big bridges, vevy vevy
big wars... wout knowing whether these things are useful or not. This
is the sad truth.</p>

<p>Trek isn't about the "Federation" necessarily either.. How do these
fools at Bad Reboot (a JJ outfit) watch these shows? With eyes closed?
They seem to have perfected the "superficial pay homage" move, e.g. in
<em>Into the Darkness</em> Khan says "my name is Khan" veery deliberately, BR
is like ok, u remember that right, I pressed that button now we are
okay? That was cool right..? Like it's a fan thing..? It's not a fan
thing. Roddenberry's creation is the whole package, not some building,
or some word you pay random homage to.</p>
