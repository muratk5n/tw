<p><em>The Atlantic</em>: "As extraordinary as the decision by the Minneapolis
City Council was, the prospect of dismantling a police force—even one
with tens of thousands of officers—isn’t novel. In the Republic of
Georgia, it has already been done. At the turn of the 21st century,
Georgia was one of the most corrupt places on Earth. Bribery in the
country, which lies in the Caucasus and shares a border with Russia,
was rampant, and its police force, which was both a beneficiary and an
enforcer of the system, was widely distrusted. So endemic was the
issue that when a new government came to power in 2004, it determined
that the country’s police force was too corrupt to be fixed. So its
leaders decided to abolish the force entirely, sacking about 30,000
officers. Then it began the three-year process of hiring a smaller,
better trained—and, crucially, corruption-free—police force to replace
it"</p>

<hr />
<p>How do you create a peer-to-peer Twitter? Or Facebook?</p>
<p>All u need is your own node. A company or gov can provide that.</p>
<p>User logs into his own node. Installs and runs apps on that
node. Those nodes communicate with other nodes to do their work. The
end.</p>
<p>A twitter app would simply publish ur latest tweets (via JSON, on your
own server), expose this info through an outside-callable
interface. The nodes of the "followers" will hit these APIs once in a
while to collect and present them in their app when the "follower
user" logs in to his node. Caching mechanisms, async messaging can be
easily implemented to speed this up.</p>
<p>This Open Twitter, Open Facebook can be open source based, u download
social net code from Github, to your node, and run it. But most users
wont deal with that, they will simply get their apps preinstalled on
the node, or choose apps through a simple Web interface (which in the
background would know which code to get from Github).</p>
<p>Censoring open, peer-to-peer apps will be harder. There is no single
company to intimidate.</p>

<p>"[A]s the world adopted low-cost solar and low-cost batteries, we
learned more about their limitations. Electricity is many things, but
it’s not a panacea.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing an all-electric economy is its
regionality. Power plants are rarely more than a few hundred miles
from the homes and businesses they power. As a result, the world is
divided into hundreds of regional electricity markets – individual
electric fiefdoms with their own rules, regulations, and
resources. That regionality and those resources become the challenge
as the world moves to wind and solar electricity; not every
electricity market has access to the same quality of wind and
solar. Some places like Australia and the U.S. are so flooded with
cheap renewable energy that it’s wreaking havoc in their electricity
markets, while others like Northern Europe, Japan, and Korea have such
poor wind and solar resources they have no hope of ever powering their
economies completely by renewable energy alone.</p>

<p>"Susskind urged me to study string theory, too, but I’m not taking that
advice. First of all, string theory looks more like a dead end now
than ever. Moreover, it would take far too long to learn—at least six
years of graduate-level study, one of my quantum advisers
estimated--and my old brain would probably never grasp it. Edward
Witten, whom some say is the smartest physicist since Newton, told me
that when he read early papers on string theory in the 1970s, he found
them “opaque.” (String theory’s hardness could explain its
persistence. Those who master it can’t admit they have wasted their
time on a dead end.)"</p>
