# Week 40

Main news sources currently, *DW* and *France 24 English*, for TV
like, in the background, news talking head type of watching. Less
drama, calmer, and once in a while a good documentary (on DW)

Haha a German on DW just used the word *schadenfreude* for Trump.

I like how Kal-eee-fornia calls green vehicles "zero-emission vehicles",
not electric. That wld be fine for me too, technically, a fuel-cell
also generates electricity, but this wording helps to avoid confusion
and widens the definition.

---

And no, there are no parallels here to the EU / UK relation 🤨 🙄 

---

Everyone who is pro these empires, whether it is Rome, Byzantium or
"Otto" have an agenda.

"Like all humanities [archeology] is a product of its time and
Victorian archaeologists were part of a British Empire which compared
itself to Rome, so they had every reason to suggest that when great
empires collapse disaster and chaos follow"

---

There was no barbarism after Romans left Britain. The so-called Dark
Ages is a myth. What a shock.

Azerbaijani gobble gobble speaka sounds somewhat different than
Anatolian version. Same words mostly, but different expressions,
idioms.. ex, apparently they call the football goaly *kapıcı*, "the
doorman". Kinda funny.. And the air travel announcements; their pilots
announce plane landing with the words *the plane will now fall*. Story
goes once when it was announced my tiggers in the plane lost their
shit.

"@AnnCoulter

I don't think the conservative take on @realDonaldTrump paying no
taxes should be: BECAUSE HE'S SMART! I've paid nearly 50% of my income
in taxes, year after year, and any system that allows billionaires to
pay ZERO is unspeakable corrupt. How about changing it, Democrats?"

---

The Jeremy Rifkin 2002 book is key. It came out in the hell years of
post 2001 and made the first attempt of imagening a post oil future
(bcz it, rightfully, blamed oil addiction for the mishap). Even Dubya
was repeating lines from this book at the time. Sadly post oil turned
into "post ME oil (blaming ME addiction, reaching the conclusion if we
use our own we'll be fine)", US fossil resources were deployed and
another chance on green energy revolution was lost. Of course then
came 'the battery' and its the wild eyed retarded cult followers with
their 'hip certainty' and not enough brains to back it up. Fail
continued.

"Denominated in euros". Swell. I wonder if H2 can help turn the Euro
into the global reserve currency...

Oil, plus US military, made dollar the king. A new energy source, like
H2 can do that for the Euro? This time energy is not dug up, but
created by technology. If the tech is supplied to "sunshine countries"
with the promise of selling the produce back, and in Euro, would this
be enough to kickstart a global reserve currency?

The hegemon, could, still theoretically invade but would have a hard
time securing a non-concentrated resource, like was done with
oil? Attacking electrolysers? Harder IMO.

"The European Union has set a target to build 40 gigawatts of
renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030, the equivalent of twice the
capacity of China’s Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest energy
plant. For that, it envisages as much as 470 billion euros of public
and private investments by 2050 and plans to kickstart a global
hydrogen market, allowing the fuel to be traded as a liquid commodity
denominated in euros"

I bet this is why office-dwelling, technobabbling folk like this shit,
a solution for 1 percenters..  I'd send them to Bolivia, they can
create all the coups they want over there to get their lithium, and
live happily ever after. They cld do two coups a day... one in the
morning, one in the afternoon. 'I need 50 more kilos of
lithium'. 'Okay, we'll just do a coup, and get 50 kilos'. That will be
the system.

---

What is this, a kumbaya moment? 'Let's hold hands and be
friends?'. Are these people retarded?

If bats are 'part' of the solution, they can only be 1% of the
solution. Not 50%, not 30%, not even 10%. One percent. There isn't
enough lithium in the world for that-plus-that approach. And since 1%
isn't viable economically, the battery option is as good as dead. They
have exactly zero place in the future.

BTW, once you bet on the simplest, most efficient tech basis (key
decision in engineering) then you can innovate easier on more parts of
the problem, simultaneously. Maybe in the future H2 wont be in tanks
anymore, but in metallic form, or in ammonia, or somewhere
else... These can all be seperately innovated on, while the base
architecture remains the same. So cars can anchor on H2 as fuel, and
further innovation gets you that fuel more and more
efficiently. Infrastructure, adaption, TCO are all part of it.

FT: "The world’s biggest aircraft maker Airbus unveiled 'historic'
designs for hydrogen-fuelled passenger planes on Monday. A few days
later, the world’s first sizeable aircraft to be powered by hydrogen
took flight. It was piloted by start-up ZeroAvia, based in California
and Cranfield, England. A commercial launch might be just three years
away, it says.

As aviation comes under pressure to curb emissions, investment in
hydrogen is being stepped up. Hopes of using battery technology as a
green alternative to jet fuel are fading. Batteries are just too heavy
for long flights, given their low energy density. Airbus, with
Rolls-Royce, closed a demonstrator project in April. ...

The EU is pushing green hydrogen hard, arguing that it could meet
nearly a quarter of world energy demand by 2050. The UK government,
which backed the ZeroAvia venture, is also keen"

They are there to tip the balance, to decide between submerge or
rising to surface. I think a sub is built with juust enough weight
right at the edge of that balance; then filling tanks or emptying them
tips the scale either way. Tanks alone could not do that. You can't
balance a force proportional to displaced water with just water.

"But you said subs require weight.. What are those tanks [taking water
in] are for then?"

Habit from aero -- '50 kg craft hover requires 50 kg of thrust' u say,
makes it easier to think about it, technically incomplete, but getting
force from mass is easy, $F = ma$ or $F = m g$, $g = 9.8$
approximately, or 10. For force mass of $m = 50 kg$ is multiplied by
10, becomes 500 Newtons.

I'd love to see someone try to make a sub fly. If you see that shit in

An Ohio class sub weighs 16000 tons. 16K TONS. Typical car weighs < 2,

While it looks fun, a submarine hobby might not be practical. Say I
wanted to have a subsurface living environment, width 2.5, height 3
length 6 meters. This means

```python
w=2.5;h=3;l=6
print (w*h*l, 'm^3')
```

```text
45.0 m^3
```

of volume. 1 cubic meter of water is 1 ton. Then, and bcz when you
submerge something same amount of volume of water in weight pushes
back at you, to counteract it and to remain below surface, you need
provide downward pull of 45 tons! You must artificially *add weight*
to keep this thing below water. People use steel, lead, whatever it
takes to make the structure heavy; this complicates things
logistically in DIY terms, hauling something >20 tons in a truck is a
major pain in the ass. Then u need build on site, or in a navy
yard. We r now talking lots of material, hairy logistics.. government
level stuff.

My interests / skillset are mostly around keeping things light, subs
are a different kinda game.

"The Judiciary Act of 1789 established the first Supreme Court, with
six Justices. In 1801, President John Adams and a lame-duck Federalist
Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which reduced the Court to
five Justices in an attempt to limit incoming President Thomas
Jefferson’s appointments. Jefferson and his Democratic-Republicans
soon repealed that act, putting the Court back to six Justices. Then,
in 1807, Jefferson and Congress added a seventh Justice when Congress
added a seventh federal court circuit.

In early 1837, President Andrew Jackson was able to add two additional
Justices after Congress expanded the number of federal circuit court
districts. Under different circumstances, Congress created the 10th
Circuit in 1863 during the Civil War, and the Court briefly had 10
Justices. Congress then passed legislation in 1866 to reduce the Court
to seven Justices. That only lasted until 1869, when a new Judiciary
Act sponsored by Senator Lyman Trumbull put the number back to nine
Justices"

"The cost of proteins will be five times cheaper by 2030 and 10 times
cheaper by 2035 than existing animal proteins, before ultimately
approaching the cost of sugar. They will also be superior in every key
attribute – more nutritious, healthier, better tasting, and more
convenient, with almost unimaginable variety.

This means that, by 2030, modern food products will be higher quality
and cost less than half as much to produce as the animal-derived
products they replace.

The impact of this disruption on industrial animal farming will be
profound. By 2030, the number of cows in the U.S. will have fallen by
50% and the cattle farming industry will be all but bankrupt"

If there are cheap, large scale processes that can generate green H2,
a company like Solar Foods can skip the step of generating it on their
own, just purchase it on the market, speeding up the process.

---

H2 will be required even to produce food! Energy for the car, energy for you!

"Solar Foods, a Finland-based company, has developed a process to use
renewable electricity and CO2 to produce a healthy ingredient that
looks like wheat flour and contains 50% protein. 'Because we don’t use
sugars, or similar agricultural feedstocks, we can completely
disconnect from agriculture,' Vainikka says. The process uses solar
power to split water through electrolysis in a bioreactor, creating
hydrogen that can give microbes energy as they’re also fed carbon. The
microbes produce a food that’s composed of roughly 20-25% carbs, 5-10%
fat, and 50% protein"

Battery based solutions cannot be scaled.

Mainstream storage neeeds to be anchored on something else.

---

If everyone used batteries to store energy, here is the amt of lithium
needed.. Single person consumes 10 KW of energy, 240 Kwh / day, to
hold the energy required for a day, for everyone,


```python
consumption = 10 # kw, per person
pop = 7.8e9 # world population
daily_world_consumption = consumption*24*pop # kwh
kg_lit_needed = daily_world_consumption / 70.0 * 60.0
print ('needed,', int(kg_lit_needed / 1e9), 'million tons') # billion kg
```

```text
needed, 1604 million tons
```

Required lithium is over 90 TIMES of what is available in reserves.

---

There is >60kg of lithium carbonate in a 70kWh battery. The entire
world reserve for lithium is estimated to be ~17 million tonnes.

Simply put, there isn't enough of this shit to go around.

---

400 liters of water is used per kilo of lithium production. Major waste.

Water use is a problem bcz while lithium rich water is dug up, potable
water resources also shift.

You are one with the tree... Trippy dude.

"[D]espite the incredible diversity of living things, animals, plants,
and the enormous variety and diversity of micro-organisms, we all have
characteristics that we share.  The same biochemical base, the same
DNA as genetic material, and we're all based on the same proteins.
Everything that's in bacteria, fungus, birds, whales or plants is the
same stuff"
