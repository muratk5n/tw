Noone knows. There have been some experiments with modified form of
issue based voting; They sample a group of people from the population,
get them the necessary information on an issue, hoping that these
people become knowledgable enough so they can run judgement on the
issue.  But, who prepares the information? The knowledge in a briefing
could influence a decision..

It's like jury work in US, random citizens are selected to decide on
court case. That duty is no cakewalk BTW, ppl cram into a room and
spend hours in there, listen to witnesses, lawyers, so in a way become
a mini-expert on the issue themselves before they decide.

"How will postmodern governance look like?" 

---

That is modern politics. Centralized, concentrated,
synchronized. Prev post is about products, liking something that
anyone can run a judgement on. In modern gov there laws, regulation,
military, bureucracy "out there" and you send people "in" who know (or
learn, but eventually know), manipulate that system in your
favor.

"But isn't leadership important, as in politics?"

"In modern marketing, this idea–that a tiny cadre of connected people
triggers trends–is enormously seductive. ... In addition to The
Tipping Point, there was The Influentials, by marketing gurus Ed
Keller and Jon Berry, as well as the gospel according to PR firms such
as Burson-Marsteller, which claims 'E-Fluentials' can 'make or break a
brand.' ..

Yet, if you believe [social scientist Duncan] Watts, all that money
and effort is being wasted. Because according to him, Influentials
have no such effect. Indeed, they have no special role in trends at
all.

He has analyzed email patterns and found that highly connected people
are not, in fact, crucial social hubs"

I hate to say it, the man was a hero, but Ike, having seen war up
close, and wanting to keep fighting on the cheap might have leaned
little too heavy on spycraft during his Presidency. The Mosdaddeq
thing might have been an outgrowth of that... There was also
"pactomania" during his time in office, prob for the same
reasons.. But the spycraft would have countries, esp developing world
always looking over their shoulders. Funny thing is they always say
that abt Russia that they leaned so much on spycraft.

"For decades bigger and bigger colliders got funded thanks to past
prestige, but prestige fades away while costs grew until hitting human
resources and time-scales...

Around 2000 German physicists proposed a new collider, but the answer
was nein. Around 2010 Americans tried, but the answer was no. Next
Japanese tried, but the answer was 'we express interest' which in
Japanese probably means no. Europeans waited hoping that new
technology will be developed while the Large Hadron Collider will
discover new physics and motivate a dedicated new collider to be
financed once the economic crisis is over. Instead of new technology
and new physics we got a new virus and a possible new crisis.

The responsibility of being the last dinosaur does not help
survival. Innovative colliders would need taking risks, but unexplored
energies got so high that the cost of a failure is no longer
affordable"

I hate to say it, Mustache is right on this one. Especially for *I Am
CRM* types, the advice is __not__ to rely on instinct, conceptualize
things and act through them.

Bolton: "I came to understand that [DJT] believed he could run the
Executive Branch and establish national- security policies on
instinct, relying on personal relationships with foreign leaders, and
with made-for-television showmanship always top of mind.  Now,
instinct, personal relations, and showmanship are elements of any
President’s repertoire.  But they are not all of it, by a long
stretch.  Analysis, planning, intellectual discipline and rigor,
evaluation of results, course corrections, and the like are the
blocking and tackling of presidential decision-making, the unglamorous
side of the job.  Appearance takes you only so far"

"@skdh

Here is something that should worry you. Each time I give a public
lecture people come up to me and say they agree with me that building
a bigger collider is currently a nonsense idea. It's a huge investment
with little scientific benefit and basically no societal relevance

I mostly get this from physicists of other disciplines (condensed
matter physicists seem to feature prominently, but maybe just because
there are many of them) but also from particle physicists who have
left the field, both theoreticians and experimentalists 

Yet, there is not a single one of them on the public record willing to
speak out. The reason I keep getting quoted by newspapers and
magazines is simply THAT THEY CAN'T FIND ANYONE ELSE WILLING TO SPEAK
OUT.

It's funny among the three variables only one variable requires human
judgement. All others can simply be observed. Econ effect; voter knows
whether he is richer or poorer. Incumbency for >1 terms or not; that
is a fact. This leaves popularity of the incumbent, the only thing
where a judgement is applied. It works bcz the measure is coarse
(individuals judgement will have errors, normally distributed which
can be [corrected](../../2020/07/crowd-wisdom.html)
through an average).
