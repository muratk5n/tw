<p>Yes there is such a thing as low-information voter. I have to add
though, almost <strong>all</strong> voters are low-information voters. Econ
recently started talking abt a similar concept, i.e. individual actors
lacking information, so cannot make rational decisions, there are now
behavioural economists so forth. Austrians too have a few things to
say on this issue (so they have their moments when they are not busy
shoving a goldbar up their ass). People don't know shit so cannot act
rationally in econ. Why do some ppl assume otherwise in politics? It
is a single, simple decision is based on very rough perceptions, their
own pocketbook, few other traits, in the aggregate works better than
the alternatives. That's it.</p>

<p>Most features attributed to subcultures, say, in the positive, is
placebo. Keep saying "my people" are [certain way], u can start acting
that way, bcz u'd be pushing self as such. It has been proven in the
negative. When kids were reminded of their historically disadvantaged
minority status during tests their scores went down.</p>

<p>India protests: any gov should have the right to choose who they allow
in their country. If they want less ppl of a certain religion that is
their right.</p>
<p>However nat party BJP's rhetoric has been so divisive against their
own <em>citizen</em> Muslims that this last law became the last drop in a
chain of slights, triggering protests. Now some citizens are thinking
"what if there is a citizenship test next that'll target me and kick
me out?". I can't say I blame them. </p>

translated to <em>System Error</em>, suggestively saying ES was the error? In

recorded all the doings of an evil machine, of course reading the book
u understand the title is about that machine keeping a record on us.</p>
