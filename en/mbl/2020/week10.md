# Week 10

Schumah threatening con judges on abortion? He is like "we can't lose
our faux issue! That issue is the only reason we are here! That's how
we eat! It needs to stay in its current form forever! We need this
shit!  Do you know what you are dealing with!"

It's so sad. A politician being reduced to this. Inept Dem centrism
lead all here, both sides needing a dividing issue so bad, they
created this mess, and now they are shocked it can actually take a
life of its own. Same with guns.

The problem with gov deficit spending (towards businesses) isnt bcz of
the deficit itself. It is that it replaces people demand with gov
demand. Such demand will create inefficiencies in the market if such
good is marketable.

I am not talking abt social services, but stuff that is already part
of the market econ. Take a toilet seat maker. There is crisis, gov
steps in starts buying toilet seats... But it can pay $10,000 for
f-ing toilet seat! It happened at the Pentagon before!

Taibbi: "Some part of Sanders seems to hold out hope that something is
left over in the DNA of the Democratic Party from those F.D.R. days,
something that can be saved and restored. He seems to have a nostalgic
fondness for it, as he seems to for Biden himself.

But this version of the Democratic Party that now has Biden as its
face wants to bury him. They’ve smeared him as a racist, sexist dupe
for Putin, an amateur and back-bencher who doesn’t understand power
and can’t “get things done.”

By getting as far as he has, and raising as much money as he has,
Sanders has already demolished half of that argument. To finish the
job, he has to show he understands the difference between doing well
and winning"

The current "system" is nowhere near at its optimal given its
technological base. 3W progress is patchy. For large-scale systems you
design for connectivity loss, problems, shutdowns from ground-up. We
need to be ready for intermittency, not constant connectiviy.

"Constant connectivity defines 21st-century life, and the
infrastructure undergirding it all is both digital (the internet and
our social media platforms) and physical (the gig economy, e-commerce,
global workplaces). Despite a tumultuous first two decades of the
century, much of our connected way of life has evaded the stress of a
singular global event. The possibility of a global pandemic currently
posed by the new coronavirus threatens to change that altogether"

Right on canceling (due to range they say) but it is possible to get
range from renewables.

"IndyGo is canceling an electric bus order and buying diesels. The
IndyGo board approved on Thursday the order of new diesel buses to run
on Route 39, the future Purple Line, and canceled an electric bus
order"

Like I said death rate is closer to 10% than 1%. The way to calculate it is
death / death + recovered. From the latest China numbers,

```
Confirmed  Deaths	Recoveries
79,251	   2,835	39,246
```

```python
2835 / (39246.0+2835) * 100.0
```

```text
Out[1]: 6.73700720039923
```

Death rate is nearly 7%. This is huge. It can kill half a billion people!

ROIC = Return on Invested Capital. Seems like a good metric to judge
company by. From [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-metrics-return-equity-return-220854430.html),

"ROIC measures the return that an investment generates for those who
have provided capital and how well a company generates cash flow
relative to the capital it has invested in its business."

Formula

NOPAT / Average Invested Capital

NOPAT = Operating Income * (1 - Tax Rate))

Average Invested Capital = (Total Shareholder's Equity + Debt - Cash)

Tax Rate = 25.75%

They do the AIC as average btw to quarters. I just took Q4. Operating
income is a sum of last 4 quarters, the rest again Q4.

```python
from yahoofinancials import YahooFinancials
import pandas as pd

def roic(ticker):
    yahoo_financials = YahooFinancials(ticker)
    all_statement_data_qt =  yahoo_financials.get_financial_stmts('quarterly', ['income', 'balance'])
    i = all_statement_data_qt['incomeStatementHistoryQuarterly']
    b = all_statement_data_qt['balanceSheetHistoryQuarterly']

    operatingIncome = 0
    for j in range(4):
    	q = i[ticker][j]
    	dfi = pd.DataFrame(q)
    	operatingIncome += np.float(dfi.ix['operatingIncome'])

    q4b = b[ticker][0]
    df4b = pd.DataFrame(q4b)
    totalStockholderEquity = float(df4b.ix['totalStockholderEquity'])
    debt = float(df4b.ix['shortLongTermDebt'])
    cash = float(df4b.ix['cash'])
    nopat = operatingIncome * (1.0-0.2575)
    return (nopat / (totalStockholderEquity + debt - cash))
```

For Apple,

```python
print (roic('AAPL'))
