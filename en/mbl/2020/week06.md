Apocalyptic movie script: airborne virus originating from China scares
off neighboring countries so they collectively nuke China. But the
virus keeps spreading, so everyone keeps nuking eachother. Cue in *Mad

"The price-to-sales ratio (Price/Sales or P/S) is calculated by taking
a company's market capitalization (the number of outstanding shares
multiplied by the share price) and divide it by the company's total
sales or revenue over the past 12 months. The lower the P/S ratio, the
more attractive the investment."

I am now pretty sure now 9/11 was the work of US "allies".

They did not want US leave ME. US was abt to do its pivot to Asia
then. Also Pentagon missing money issue became a thing, an audit was
coming, in fact this was the last thing Rummy said publicly before
9/11 (on 9/10, the day before).

If allies can trigger a whole new insurgency in the form ISIS, couldnt
they knock down a few buildings? Not necessarily the known leaders of
allies, but possibly a combo of their deep states.

Democrats self-destructing my ass. Reps went through a much
"destructive" process, and they are still here.

I guess the expectation of Dems is to always be ultra-capitalist, and
to be centrist. They should not be "radical". Then, of course, they
should not have internal arguments, they should have similar looking
candidates. They need to remain the way they are, irrelevant, useless,
and inert.

The relationship between the diversity of products produced by a
country and its GDP is shown below (math and code). Hidalgo (a

to the "know-how network" of that country, and such networks can only
form in close proximity. All of that contribute positively to
growth.

I like it the article mentions two of three waves. While reading I was
thinking "but would these args apply to a diff wave" then I saw the
paragraph below.

Article says there is a confluence of tech and people, open to abuse,
exploitation in whichever direction the tech pulls. Possible.

BBC -- "Are the lessons of agrarian empires applicable to our
post-18th Century period of industrial capitalism? (Read about the
greatest long term threats facing humanity.)

I would argue that they are. Societies of the past and present are
just complex systems composed of people and technology. The theory of
“normal accidents” suggests that complex technological systems
regularly give way to failure. So collapse may be a normal phenomenon
for civilisations, regardless of their size and stage"

produce hydrogen, are up by more than 45 per cent this year to their
highest level since 2007. Meanwhile, shares in Sweden’s Powercell have
risen 28 per cent over the same period and 342 per cent over the past

Yes there is such a thing as low-information voter. I have to add
though, almost __all__ voters are low-information voters. Econ
recently started talking abt a similar concept, i.e. individual actors
lacking information, so cannot make rational decisions, there are now
behavioural economists so forth. Austrians too have a few things to
say on this issue (so they have their moments when they are not busy
shoving a goldbar up their ass). People don't know shit so cannot act
rationally in econ. Why do some ppl assume otherwise in politics? It
is a single, simple decision is based on very rough perceptions, their
own pocketbook, few other traits, in the aggregate works better than
the alternatives. That's it.

Ah - got the wrong Tibshirani. Father and son both statisticians!

I knew that name was familiar and Ryan looked too young. Turns out the
Tibs of the famous ESL book is the father. The opt lectures are by the
son. Quality lectures.

India protests: any gov should have the right to choose who they allow
in their country. If they want less ppl of a certain religion that is
their right.

However nat party BJP's rhetoric has been so divisive against their
own *citizen* Muslims that this last law became the last drop in a
chain of slights, triggering protests. Now some citizens are thinking
"what if there is a citizenship test next that'll target me and kick
me out?". I can't say I blame them.

Saw TR poster for Ed Snowden book translation. It's title was
translated to *System Error*, suggestively saying ES was the error? In
a patriarchal soc ES is made to look like the error? The title
*Permanent Record* has a different feel, on one hand suggesting ES
recorded all the doings of an evil machine, of course reading the book
u understand the title is about that machine keeping a record on us.

Israeli right is against a Pal state. Jordan Valley annex they are
fine with. Annex it all. If Israelis are afraid in combined popul due
to numbers the next Israeli PM could be named Habib, well then give
Gaza to Egypt so there'll be less of chance of Habib becoming PM
