I see some Baydın presence in Missiouri, Florida but they are not

Credit Card Delinquency Rates - Small Banks

I believe this is % of ppl missing payment for 30 days or more. If

Pop quiz - what is Roubini culturally? His parents are from Iran, they
were Jewish, he was born in Istanbul, he grew up in Italy, he spent
long time in US.

Because he was born in TR, I could try to claim him as one of my own,
my tigga, a homeboy.. But that would be a mistake, he didn't spend
much time there. He a Jew? Where was he at when he grew up?  In Italy,
hence the accent. That's the answer: he's a guinea. Real guinea, not
like ones in US who are Americans but try to cling to a faux identity
because of their moronic parents so they wildly gesticulate trying to
look a certain way but fail. No, this guy is a legit guinea. Problem
solved.

Ideally I'd support all kinds of shit. But Israel made TSS all but
impossible by turning the West Bank into swiss cheese by allowing
settlers. They won the war took that land fine. But then they were
indecisive abt what to do with it, Israeli citizens started slowly to
settle there, drip drip drip and we are here. Does this indecisiveness
have something to do with Israelis psychologically seeing self
(incorrectly) not being ready for governing others? Jews lived under
majorities for a long time in other geographies right? Maybe that
feeling of outsiderness plays a role. Have to let that all go son. U
win it, u own it.

Another aspect of Bernie's use of the word socialism is to front-run
its "slur" status. Thanks to the lovely centrists people the pol
sphere shifted so far right that even a person with European leftist
views would invariably be called a socialist, of the extreme kind; so
by owning up to the word beforehand u aim to neutralize its
effect. Solid move in polemic; someone calls you a name, u either deny
the name, or do the unexpected, own up to it.

So first, socialism creates a contrast, second neutralizes a
"slur". If pressed on specifics, 'aw but it's socialism for this and
that', u give the run-around, 'certain services are already
socialized', how it is democratic socialism not that crazy kind, etc
Bernie had the MLK quote in one debate which was great.

The bonus is they keep fighting you, the attention is always on the
"socialist", being attacked, now the peeps thinking "maybe there's
something to this guy". They can't win.

"It seems that the markets have understood. From the beginning of this
year the shares of companies in hydrogen technologies – especially
electrolysers and fuel cells – have gone up dramatically. This is a
good sign but definitely not enough. The price cuts of this disruptive
technology will follow only if we embark on a joint acceleration of an
industrial manufacturing. Here we need policy makers to pave the way
with a clear commitment that the right legal framework will be set
up. Still the use of electricity for the production of hydrogen is
burdened by policy driven factors.

To be honest, the recent recast of the 'Renewable Energy Directive' is
not helping the case as it is built on the logic of an 'all-electric
scenario' which would delay the decarbonization"

People don't seem to appreciate what modernity does to its
citizens. You get thrown around, from one concentrated institution to
another, in a constant game of musical chairs. You are constantly
interacting, moving, and need to adapt to the common language to
survive. From [Gellner](../../2013/03/nations-and-nationalism-gellner.html),

>Men located within [modernity] cannot generally rest in the same
>niches all their lives; and they can only seldom rest in them, so to
>speak, over generations [..] ... [Modern society ..] has to be mobile
>whether it wishes to be so or not [.. Also] a society which is
>destined to a permanent game of musical chairs cannot erect deep
>barriers of rank, of caste or estate, between the various sets of
>chairs which it possesses. That would hamper the mobility

Most still see majority - minority relations in terms of agrarian
empires who would let religious, ethnic groups in their ghettos,
with different dress.. 

All that is gone. Modernity is a freight train. We are all on it.

The trick Jewish people did best was, like the French lady's [example](https://youtu.be/ttBWXH-ihL0)
shared previously, the parents, and parent's parents managed to keep
the "homeland" idea alive. Then, sold on this idea, some went "back"
when time was appropriate. But, in a way, they were fooled.

Now together in the new country, as any group can reach some kind of
merger, the new arrivals are creating a new culture (people born into
it would become automatically part of that culture). Not necessarily
ancient Jewish per se, but a combo of all nationalities who arrived
there, Russians, Polaks, Germans, etc. enmeshed with the realities of
the region. In a way they are much like United States. No wonder
Israelis like US so much.

---

You were, actually. With the exception of maybe those Hassidic guys,
or ones who truly isolated themselves, the rest were assimilated.. So
what "came back" to the "homeland" were not Jews but Germans,
Americans, etc. How the f--k would u beat Arabs otherwise? German,
European know-how, organization ability, culture beat them, not your
funky hats. And now there are Jews from Moscow, St. Petersburg and
guess what? They are Russians.
