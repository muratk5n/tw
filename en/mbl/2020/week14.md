Of course he was right. He just couldn't sell it.

The Atlantic: "Even before the coronavirus outbreak, many on the
“populist,” or “radical,” left insisted that globalization, climate
change, automation, and inequality were creating the conditions for
their own political resurgence, despite their leaders—Bernie Sanders
in the United States, Jeremy Corbyn in Britain—being rejected at the
ballot box. Now, in a world where governments are nationalizing wages
and public services just to keep their economies afloat, such claims
no longer seem far-fetched. Indeed, Corbyn, who will be replaced as
Labour leader today, said the emergency economic measures being taken
in Britain have proved him 'absolutely right'"

CDC: "It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social
distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.  CDC
is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to
slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus
and do not know it from transmitting it to others.  Cloth face
coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common
materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public
health measure"

Great. Each major country needs such capability within their borders. 

"German scientist Olfert Landt was already on alert. For 30 years, he
had worked on diagnosing emerging diseases, including Severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS). He wanted to make a test kit to help
doctors diagnose the disease -- and he wanted to do it fast.
Virologists usually wait until the genetic material of a new virus is
sequenced to start working on a test. This time, Landt and his
30-strong company TIB Molbiol got started early. By January 9 they had
designed their first test kit using SARS and other known coronaviruses
as references. Along with scientists from a local university hospital,
he designed three kits, meaning once the sequence was published, they
could pick the one that worked best..

In Hong Kong [... another scientist] Poon waited for the sequence.

All forms of life have a type of molecule that carries their genetic
instructions. In humans, and most life forms, that's DNA -- the
genetic material that tells us to grow two legs and walk upright...
But it wasn't until January 11, that the sequenced genome was posted
on open-source site virological.org on behalf of Zhang Yongzhen, a
professor from Shanghai's Fudan University. Chinese authorities shared
the sequence on January 12.

Once Zhang shared the sequence, Poon's team started work... Next, they
designed the test"

raw data out of visual data, which starts to fail when the visual of
the site is changed. A direct gov site would be much easier. Like u
enter treasury.gov/financials/year/ticker and out you get a JSON
