It's unbelievable how much crit Black Lives Matter slogan gets. It's
clear what it is trying to say. I see variations with "All Lives",
"White Lives", "Buildings". I guess it's a sign of the slogan's

with this thing.

Who says this was a "working class revolt"? Who gives a shit if it is

There's a fine line with these provoc articles. That John Bolton

a wrong choice, in terms of timing which naturally caused reader
backlash. NYT miscalculated. Obviously free to publish whatever eff

So true... Same goes for internal problems 

Friedman: "In geopolitics there is a key measure known as the 'margin
of error.'  It predicts how much room a country has for making
mistakes.  The margin of error consists of two parts: the types of
danger faced by a nation and the amount of power it possesses. Some
countries have very small margins of error. They tend to obsess over
the smallest detail of foreign policy, aware that the slightest
misstep can be catastrophic.  Israel and Palestine do not have massive
margins of error, because of their small size and their
location. Iceland, on the other hand, has a lot of room for
mistakes. It is small but lives in a roomy neighborhood.  The United
States has a huge margin of error.  It is safe in North America and
has tremendous power. The United States therefore tends to be careless
in how it exercises its power globally.  It's not stupid.  It simply
doesn't need to be more careful—in fact, being more careful could
often reduce its efficiency.  Like a banker prepared to make bad loans
in the expectation that he will do well in the long run, the United
States has a policy of making moves that other countries see as
reckless.  The results would be painful or even devastating for other
countries.  The United States moves on and flourishes"

Mountains are natural borders. Why do Indians and the Chinese look so
different even tho they are neighbors? I believe these peoples were
isolated from one another for a long time. It's tough to have
interactions, or war over those mountains. CH seems to be trying very
hard at that Pangong lake in Ladakh tho.

"The Himalaya mountain range separates China from India. This range
spans 1,500 miles throughout five countries"

Cornell West: "I recall my own experience of protesting in

with live ammunition in which the police stepped back and remained
still and silent as we were mercilessly attacked. Without the
intervention and protection of antifa, some of us would have
died. Sister Heather Heyer did die. I believe the attack on any
innocent person is wrong, but the focus on the protesters’ assaults on
persons or property takes our attention away from the police killing
of hundreds of black, poor and working-class people"

If police is acting too dug in as we keep seeing, w bunker mentality,

Taibbi: "The early American police forces evolved out of slave
patrols in the South, and “progressed” to enforce the Black Codes from
the Civil War period and beyond, on to Jim Crow through the late
sixties if not longer. ...

Because they’re constantly throwing those people against walls, ..
modern cops correctly perceive that they’re hated. As a result, many
embrace a “warrior” ethos that teaches them to view themselves as
under constant threat.    This is why you see so many knees on heads
and necks, guns drawn on unarmed motorists, chokeholds by the
thousand, and patterns of massive overkill everywhere ...

Police are trained to behave like occupiers, which is why they
increasingly dress like they’ve been sent to clear houses in Mosul"

I have two other methods to run that difference, significance check,
and could probably dig up a third. Interested parties need to learn
this shit before talking shop on cause and effect.

---

Of course statistical significance is one thing, practical
significance is another. That's another level of critical judgement
that needs to applied to the result. As the Gelman / Hill book says

>Statistical significance does not equal practical significance. For
>example, if the estimated predictive effect of height on earnings were
>10 dollar per inch with a standard error of 2 dollar, this would be
>statistically but not practically significant. Conversely, an estimate
>of 10,000 dollar per inch with a standard error of 10,000 dollar would
>not be statistically significant, but it has the possibility of being
>practically significant (and also the possibility of being zero; that
>is what “not statistically significant” means)."

---

Impeachement was on 2019-12-18? We look at approval data before and
after, 6 months before, 2 months after,

[Data](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_topline.csv)

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/tmp/approval_topline.csv',parse_dates=True,index_col='modeldate')
df = df[['approve_estimate','disapprove_estimate']]
df = df.sort_index(by='modeldate')

df['net'] = df.approve_estimate - df.disapprove_estimate
event = '2019-12-18'; d1 = '2019-06-01'; d2 = '2020-03-01'
df1 = df[(df.index > d1) & (df.index < event)]
df2 = df[(df.index > event) & (df.index < d2)]
print (df1['net'].mean())
print (df2['net'].mean())
```

```text
-11.725994522613066
-9.786354182648402
```

Net approval was lower before impeachement than after.

Is this significant? Let's compare means of both samples, using Welch
two sample t-test,

```python
from statsmodels.stats.weightstats import ttest_ind
print ( ttest_ind(df1['net'], df2['net']) )
```

```text
(-14.416007336365869, 3.970177267005474e-42, 814.0)
```

The hypothesis that they are the same is rejected. Statistically these
numbers are different. So impeachement helped Trump by 2% points.

---

One needs to look at the data and run statistical tests to answer that
question. See above.

Of course he did. There was the right focus on science, all the
reforms that were talked about in the past 100+ yrs were
enacted. Changing the alphabet, women's rights, etc. The problem is
with the national narrative, which bordered on the fantastical. But
what makes it worse is how Kemal enmeshed his persona in those fairy
tales so now seperating the two is impossible. But it needs to be
done. A new Republic possibly. The French do that, no? They number
them too, like 1st, 2nd..?

"But didn't Kemal of TR do some good stuff?"
