Kelager: "The fluid is constrained to stay with the grid. It simply
cannot exist outside the grid domain, and thus makes it a difficult
problem to let the fluid flow naturally, e.g. when a fluid container
fractures"

---

Kelager: "The Navier-Stokes equations .. formulate the motion of an
Eulerian fluid"

---

.. and the Eulerian vpoint means that a person "likes to watch"? 😶

---

Lagrangian viewpoint -- does that make a person French minded?

---

SPH (for fluid simulation) uses the Lagrangian viewpoint which
simulates / follows the physics of particles. I guess this viewpoint
comes more natural to me bcz of software background; thinking of
particles that are simulated make more sense than "the Eularian
viewpoint", thinking a predefined grid that doens't change and u watch
the fluid passing through. In either case number of particles / grid
size defines the precision of the calculation, but IMO Lagrangian
viewpoint can get better precision, especially in edge cases.

Constructing societies that are against human nature (meaning forager)
can cause many ills. I bet that is one reason for the *hikikomori* in
Japan, the reclusive adolescents who dont leave home. This cld be a
way to subconciously reduce excessive stimuli which modern life
generates in excess, especially in cities. We are built for a certain
level of stimuli anything over that causes problems. In the West ppl
might not become recluse but cld act oddly in different ways, maybe
crime or other things.

"[W]hat isn't discussed is how Mr. 'Content Is King' got his 'content'
...  [Redstone] bested business rivals throughout his long career as
he engineered deals for Viacom, Paramount and CBS and displayed an
unwavering passion to win. ... Viacom Networks (MTV, BET, Comedy
Central, CMT), the engine that drove Redstone's media empire was
almost entirely built on 'reality', 'live' and 'free' content. Which
is to say, Redstone's genius was finding a way to pipe content made
and paid for by other people (music labels, comedy clubs) on to
cable. And to fill the gap with non-union, unprotected 'perma-lance'
innovation in-house. Reality and music television was just
union-busting. Plain and simple. ... Reality television can seem
exciting and glamorous. Working on reality television, much less
so. As the following stories from "professionally abused" insiders
show, reality TV workers will continue... 'My Super Sweet 16'? A PA
came up with that. 'Jersey Shore'? Just a rip-off of a True Life
pitched by an AP. There was no IP ownership. No health-care. And

Movie idea, ppl leave Earth in spaceship ready to settle, escaping
apocalyptic scenario, land on Mars and then they are like 'dude it

Hah. I guess that should tell you how Americans want to be governed,
Scotus judges are not even elected by the people, they are appointed
by people who are elected by the people. So they are **twice** removed

"Gallup found that Americans [largely] approved of the [SCOTUS]
justices’ performance"
