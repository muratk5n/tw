New grand theory cannot have background dependence (omnipresent
coordinate system) at any level, including the quantum. If 1 says "but
at that scale it doesnt matter" by definition 1 is accepting that
background-dependent QM is a mere approximation. Approx is fine
obviously for computation - but at a foundational level it is not.

OK.. they come here, following this shamanism.. But there are farmers,
peasants in Anatolia. What happens when these cultures mix? It gets
weird at this point. Say people are wondering around and see a
goat. They immediately worship the goat. Then they are fuckin' it. Now
the goat's confused. Sometimes he is up, sometimes he is down... It's
a roller coaster. He just wants to be a goat, go about his day, walk
around, eating his grass.. But these humans are doing strange things
to him. He didn't sign up for that.

---

Some buffoons in TR are like "tigger came from Central Asia" (complete
bull). Who were these people? They say they were following a sort of
of naturalistic religion, some kind of shamanism.. So they prayed to
cats and dogs and shit. Like, a cat comes over and says "meow", you
have to bow down *immediately* and say "your wish is my command my
Lord". That's how the system works.

A strange way of living.

I still maintain that there is a deeper plan here, it's all about the
kid. Their (both US and UK citizen) royalty kid will run in US
elections first, and become POTUS. Then he will kill off all other
members of royal family become king. Then he will abolish UK
parliament - controlling two countries at the same time.

The movie telling the tale will be a mix of *Game of Thrones* and
*Olympus Has Fallen*.

Ah of course - that's why he didnt tie the red headband this
time. This is a more mature Rambo. Previously he was kinda gung-ho
about war.

\#lastBlood

---

In other movies Rambo was fighting sure, but he was still up in other
people's business, like in Afganistan etc. For the first time he was
"defending his home -the only legitimate case for war really-", like
the Vietnamese, with tunnels. Like I said, full circle. A grown-up
Rambo in some ways.

\#lastBlood

---

No tying of the red headband this time?

How is this a Rambo movie? I need to see the headband tying
scene. There was the ammo preperation scene, great. No headband scene.

\#lastBlood

---

How come the bad guys keep charging? YOu had to see Rambo is loaded
for bear and waiting for you. After the second tree trunk with nails,
u shoulda said 'f--k this, im getting the f--k outa here'

(But of course they kept going, and they are all dead)

\#lastBlood

---

So basically in the last Rambo movie, Rambo becomes Vietnamese,
fighting through all those tunnels... I guess the character came full
circle - from PTSD after Vietnam to Vietnamese himself.

Exec ability is most easily proven through service in goverment
(contrary to pop belief, it still matters). Boris J was not too suave
but he is enough of oaf, with some presence, and was the mayor of a
large city once. If that managerial skill is seen on media, that is
okay too; people saw Trump acting as an executive on a show, that was
good. Hell, the current Ukrainian President merely *played* a
President on TV, even that was proof enough of managerial ability.

The rest is media / mind manipulation - at a cultural level - second
level in the brain, stronger than intellect

some random jagoff.

Again, gotta be part oaf, cool, not crass, with provably present
executive ability....

DL increases the parameter space to millions, billions - these params
