How about taxes? Here is the kicker - the system can ask citizen to
__pay__ for the right to vote (a percentage of monthly $$ the system
already generates for everyone). Taxation for representation.

(Plus maybe a sales tax)

Digital basic income would make it easy for a digitial currency to
spread. You would use it bcz it gives money. Then it is snowball
effect, also ideology. Once enough people prefer it, say NanoX, do not
transact with a anything other than that currency, some will choose it
for ideological reasons bcz they want to be "with those folks over
there".

That is the game for challengers. Incumbent needs to deliver. The
delivery will seep through pocketbook, a rough popularity measure,
opinion leaders - then pol might just get reelected, and even, have
their chosen successor take their place.

"[Rant from Opt Prof, about how diff it is to sell his field] The
Dean, in his office, is receiving a delegation from a prominent firm,
with the aim of promoting a partnership between the two
institutions. The goal is to pair a technical contact from the firm
with a faculty member from the university... Once, when I was younger
and more naive, I figured I might as well make the industrialist
happy.  During one of these meetings, after a couple of iterations of
'what application field do you work on?'  followed by 'this is really
the wrong question', I had decided to break the monotony and
hopelessness of the exchange by stating I work on shortest paths in
road networks.

'Ah, this is fantastic!' came the reply, 'but unfortunately we don’t
do any of that'"

A liberterian is more like the peasant with a small patch of land than
a man in the woods. Many of the liberterian responses are rooted in
that backdrop. Rome taxed the peasant, took his sons for war,
libertard is now anti-tax and isolationist.

"Why wont they let me be so I can tend to my land?" he thinks, "the
outside" is nothing but trouble for him. This frame of ref is
defunct. You cant ever not care abt what goes on outside.

Great story on Dantzig (shared [here](../../2016/08/dantzig.html) before) -
he comes late to class copying down the problems on the
blackboard thinking they were homework problems, solves them, it turns
out the probs were two (then) hardest, yet unsolved problems of
statistics!

Meanwhile, they extol 'bipartisanship...'"

I'd always wondered why they ended this show after S1, sometimes I thought bcz it was sorta seperatist? The browncoats are the Southerners, the Core is the Yankees and the show was kind of 
 rehashing the Civil War? But probably not... A lot of stuff like this gets made in TV land, and in the weird surveilance-capitalism times we live in today, we need shows like this.
