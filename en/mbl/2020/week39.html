<p>On the surface of it all "whatever it takes" approach could look
appealing -- but if the leader says "sometimes I go to right,

this happens?" The leader himself. This raises the issue of

won’t change its volume much unless you stick it in a pump, or are
dealing with really extreme situations like sonic booms and blast
waves.  The study of how fluids behave in these situations is
generally called 'compressible flow'. It’s complicated and expensive
to simulate, and apart from acoustics doesn’t enter much into everday

<p>The native hydrogen [as in dug up from ground, not produced], almost
pure in this case, is directly burned in a suitable gas turbine, and
produces electricity for a small village. Other wells around have been
drilled to try to determine the reserves, within the meaning of oil &amp;
gas, and change the scale.</p>
<p>This success shattered many a priori: many believed that no natural
accumulation of H2 in the subsoil could exist. The initial well has
been producing for 4 years without a drop in pressure, which means it
is continuously recharged.</p>
<p>In addition, surface measurements of the H2 content of soils do not
show any leaks. These were rather expected, because the H2 molecule is
very small and very reactive, and therefore it can easily migrate and
combine with other chemical species"</p>

<p>But of course Jesus' teachings were coopted by the state (Rome),

<p>"Jesus Christ was a socialist activist" -- exactly.</p>
<p>Hudson: "The Christianity we know today is not the Christianity of
Jesus.. Indeed the Judaism that we know today is not the Judaism of
Jesus either. Lord’s Prayer, ‘forgive us our sins even as we forgive
all who are indebted to us’, refers specifically to debt.</p>
<p>Most religious leaders say that Christianity is all about sin, not
debt. But actually, the word for sin and debt is the same in almost
every language.</p>
<p>‘Schuld’, in German, means ‘debt’ as well as ‘offense’ or, ‘sin’. It’s
‘devoir’ in French. It had the same duality in meaning in the
Babylonian language of Akkadian.”</p>
<p>The idea harks back to the concept of ‘wergeld’, which existed in
parts of Europe and Babylonia, and set the value of a human life based
on their rank, paid as compensation to the family of someone who has
been injured or killed. he payment – the Schuld or obligation –
expiates you of the injury caused by the offense</p>
<p>People tend to think of the Commandment ‘do not covet your neighbour’s
wife’ in purely sexual terms but actually, the economist says it
refers specifically to creditors who would force the wives and
daughters of debtors into sex slavery as collateral for unpaid debt.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Commandment ‘thou shalt not steal’ refers to usury and
exploitation by threat for debts owing.</p>
<p>Jesus was crucified for his views on debt. Crucifixion being a
punishment reserved especially for political dissidents.</p>
<p>To understand the crucifixion of Jesus is to understand it was his
punishment for his economic views. He was a threat to the creditors.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ was a socialist activist for the continuity of regular
debt jubilees that were considered essential to the wellbeing of
ancient economies</p>
<p>Governments can forgive debt. The bible says so"</p>

<p>"I thought about [climate] a lot last week, as I tried to stop my
toddler from playing in ash, tried to calm down my dogs as they paced
and panted in mid-morning dusk light, tried to figure out whether my
air purifier was actually protecting my lungs, tried to understand why
the sky was pumpkin-colored, and tried not to think about the
carcinogen risk of breathing in wildfire smoke, week after week.The
government has committed to defending us and our allies against
foreign enemies. Yet when it comes to the single biggest existential
threat we collectively face—the one that threatens to make much of the
planet uninhabitable, starve millions, and incite violent conflicts
around the world—it has chosen to do near-nothing. Worse than that,
the federal government continues to subsidize and promote fossil
fuels"</p>

<p>Electorate not caring abt econ is possible, in Serbia in the first
election post covid the incumbent did well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aha. Markovitz (the inventor of the model I use for election
prediction) says electorate <em>will</em> understand the economic
contraction. He has a new pandemic model, drops all parameters except
one, net popularity.</p>
<p>His new regression shows DJT loses even at net popul 0%, currently at
-%9.</p>
<p>"There are good reasons to expect that two of these predictors — the
change in real GDP in the second quarter and the time for change dummy
variable — will not perform as they normally do in 2020. Although the
U.S. economy is currently experiencing a severe downturn, with real
GDP plunging by an almost unprecedented amount in the second quarter,
voters do not appear to hold the incumbent president responsible for
this. That is undoubtedly because the recession was deliberately
induced in order to try to control the spread of the deadly
coronavirus"</p>
