Why so many Rep pols showed loyalty to Trump election claims? Bcz they
knew claims wld go nowhere, and there are still bunch of his followers
in their districts, so then the question is when the shitshow ends,
what do you want those ppl remember you by? As the jagoff who knifed
him, or sorta stood by, repeated some bogus shit along with many
others, than "celebrated democracy" after it was all over.

I knew there was something behind this interest, other than the art
piece itself. There is nothing special about the piece really. 

"Before its theft [in 1911], the 'Mona Lisa' was not widely known
outside the art world. Leonardo da Vinci painted it in 1507, but it
wasn't until the 1860s that critics began to hail it as a masterwork
of Renaissance painting. And that judgment didn't filter outside a
thin slice of French intelligentsia. ...

After the Louvre announced the theft, newspapers all over the world
ran headlines about the missing masterpiece.

'60 Detectives Seek Stolen 'Mona Lisa,' French Public Indignant,' the
New York Times declared. The heist had become something of a national
scandal.

'In France, there was a great deal of concern that American
millionaires were buying up the legacy of France — the best
paintings,' Dorothy Hoobler says. At one point, American tycoon and
art lover J.P. Morgan was suspected of commissioning the theft. Pablo
Picasso was also considered a suspect, and was questioned.

And as tensions were escalating between France and Germany ahead of
World War I, 'there were people who thought the Kaiser was behind it,'
Hoobler says"

"Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man, is joining forces with Hyundai
Motor Co. in a bid to give hydrogen fuel cell vehicles the boost they
need to become more mainstream.

Ratcliffe’s Ineos Group will explore opportunities to produce and
supply hydrogen to Hyundai, which has been making fuel cell vehicles
in low volumes since 2013. Ratcliffe may also use Hyundai’s fuel cell
system in the Grenadier, the Land Rover-like sport utility vehicle
Ineos plans to bring to market next year.

Makers of cars and chemicals are finding common ground in their
pursuit of hydrogen projects. Targets are being set globally to phase
out the combustion engine and decarbonize industrial
production. Ineos, which makes 300,000 tons of hydrogen annually,
could play an instrumental role in helping set up the infrastructure
Hyundai needs for models like the Nexo SUV to catch on in Europe"

Yeah, I have a feeling carbon storage should be in a rock; not
requiring special equipment, and wont melt away easily. Basalt sounds
good.

"Basalts Turn Carbon into Stone for Permanent Storage ... Scientists
have shown that mineral carbonation can permanently capture and store
carbon quickly enough and safely enough to rise to the challenge of
climate change. ... In carbon storage experiments tied to geothermal
power plants in Iceland, 90% of injected carbon dioxide (CO2)
transformed into minerals in just 2 years. Standard carbon storage
methods can take thousands of years to do the same"

Why should gov official not read posts like mine? Bcz there is no
institutional culture around what we do, just a guy typing away
somewhere. I have no need to fit into a particular news cycle, and
that can be a problem for the official who needs to roll with that
cycle. There could be a nuke crisis somewhere, but the lone writer
could be talking about weirdest things, venting on between bouts of
screaming away, jumping up and down... Gov needs steady, and they wont
be served by the unstructured chaos that is the net publishing.

That's not to say publications with net origin will not become the net
WaPo or NYT. But when they do they should / would have an
institutional structure, some culture, delibaration. It wont be bunch
of posters sitting around in a circle beating off and typing whatever

90/00s vs 10s scifi differences? During the 90s the enemy was "out
there", out in space, through the gate, in a different galaxy, or no
evil but just natural phenomenon, like a meteor or the Sun itself --
*Stargate*, *Trek*, *Independence Day*, *Sunshine*.

10s scifi is more desparate, evil is at home, people are being
exploited by other people, and the victim / heroes are increasingly
extremely young, just kids mostly. *The Maze*, *Hunger Games*, or the
Deviant series.. *Ender's Game* has the enemy as alien, but the wars
have gone to child level, which is sad. Surely the book predates the
aughts but they must have picked that book to base a movie off of for
a reason.

Rapaport, *The Art of Molecular Dynamics Simulation*: "Modeling of
matter at the microscopic level is based on a comprehensive
description of the constituent particles. Although such a description
must in principle be based on quantum mechanics, MD generally adopts a
classical point of view, typically representing atoms or molecules as
point masses interacting through forces that depend on the separation
of these objects. More complex applications are likely to require
extended molecular structures, in which case the forces will also
depend on relative orientation. The quantum picture of interactions
arising from overlapping electron clouds has been transformed into a
system of masses coupled by exotic ‘springs’. The justification for
this antithesis of quantum mechanics is that not only does it work,
but it appears to work surprisingly well; on the other hand, the
rigorous quantum mechanical description is still hard pressed in
dealing with even the smallest systems"

What did I ask the honcho earlier? It was abt a particular style of
molecular dynamics computation. There is always approximation
involved, but there are many places to do that. For pairwise
interactions, fast access to neighborhood is needed, but is it enough
to get most neighbors? Well for this particular method, you have to
get __all__ neighbors. So says honcho. It will be followed.

socnet vociferously, but in the end, was it a net benefit to him and
