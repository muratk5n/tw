<p>How about taxes? Here is the kicker - the system can ask citizen to
<strong>pay</strong> for the right to vote (a percentage of monthly $$ the system
already generates for everyone). Taxation for representation.</p>

<p>Digital basic income would make it easy for a digitial currency to
spread. You would use it bcz it gives money. Then it is snowball

for ideological reasons bcz they want to be "with those folks over

Dean, in his office, is receiving a delegation from a prominent firm,
with the aim of promoting a partnership between the two

with a faculty member from the university... Once, when I was younger
and more naive, I figured I might as well make the industrialist
happy.  During one of these meetings, after a couple of iterations of
'what application field do you work on?'  followed by 'this is really
the wrong question', I had decided to break the monotony and
hopelessness of the exchange by stating I work on shortest paths in
