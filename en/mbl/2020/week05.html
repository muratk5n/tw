<p>Out of the three, GF might have had the better deal. Great career,
beat Frazier, lost to Ali, both decisively. On a talk show later on
with the other two, he was still in form, chipper, all marbles
there. Ali was <strong>gone</strong>. He could barely speak.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ah - Ali was <em>Mellow Meadow</em>. Overdid the fighting. He could have said
"Fraz, u got beaten by the guy I beat, see ya". Leave it at 1-1 with a
tilt towards him.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's true the 3rd Ali-Frazier fight took too much out of them ("we
went to Manilla as champs, came back as old men"). Some style pairings
are a natural tie. No need to push it. Foreman beats Frazier, Ali
beats Foreman, then Ali has trouble with Frazier. The calculus is out
of whack. Leave it at that. I bet Ali's Parkinsons had something to do
with that last fight</p>

<p>Hitting Baydın on social security is a first layer, reptilian level
attack (<a href="../../2014/06/the-culture-code.md">see</a>
Rapaille) Reptilian level is the fight-or-flight, survival level stuff
-- the strongest, stronger than culture even, and intellect
(policy). The attack says the money you now <strong>have</strong> will be <strong>taken</strong>
by <strong>that guy</strong>, then you might <strong>die</strong> bcz you will have <strong>no
money</strong>.</p>
<p>😨😨😨😨😨</p>
<p>It happens to be the truth of course. It makes sense to highlight it.</p>

<p>Fin shows constantly talk about stocks bcz these are names that are
familiar to most people. SBUX, AMZN - "oh well, I just had coffee at
Starbucks and shopped from Amazon". But the futures market, the
curency market, the bond market are all much larger than the equities
market (stocks). Right off the bat we see fin shows are not there to
inform, but to entertain and to pander. If they talked about
Eurodollar futures, then u have to do a song and dance abt what that
is, blah blah.. then the viewer checked out dude! The ratings are
down. Bummer. Back to stocks.</p>

<p>Eurodollar buying means an expectation of a rate cut. And a rate cut
expectation means low earning, low growth expectation - as in, bad news.</p>
<p>Bad news means bad news (u have to add that these days)</p>
