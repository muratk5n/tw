# Week 22

If you think u can parachute in on the Dem nomination, u are even
dumber than your father Fredo... And that guy was dumb.. He was mostly
known for his "oratory skills". He gave an ok speech at the 92 Dem
convention, so he might have helped elect Bill F-ing Clinton with his
"oratory".

"The National Science Foundation (NSF) would get a sweeping
remake—including a new name, a huge infusion of cash, and
responsibility for maintaining U.S. global leadership in
innovation—under bipartisan bills that have just been introduced in
both houses of Congress.

Many scientific leaders are thrilled that the bills call for giving
NSF an additional $100 billion over 5 years to carry out its new
duties. But some worry the legislation, if enacted, could compromise
NSF’s historical mission to explore the frontiers of knowledge without
regard to possible commercial applications"

Not to let Bam off the hook; whatever improved in 2nd term, it still
wasn't enough. 

---

Now that I think abt it, the Libyan mess is also Obama's 1st term.

---

Likely pattern in the GINI (inequality) plot..? Starting from the
beginning of second Clinton term, until the end of 1st Bam term GINI
becomes worse. It's almost a straight line from Clinton to Obama.
What went wrong in that 2nd Clinton term? W was a mess sure, but
degredation continued throghout Bama's 1st term.

What were the changes for his 2nd term?  I know a lot of Clinton types
were gone by then, including "the Clinton" herself, Summers, f-ing
Rahm 🤔. Is there causality here, or just "W tax cuts expiring" as some
comments suggest.

The skinny on Lebanon among IR types is this; every religious, ethnic
group is represented there. So whenever there is conflict between
those groups on the outside, there is conflict among the same groups
on the inside. IOW the situtation in Lebanon is fragile, the setup is
ready to blow, bcz of those groups. Who, which, when; that's like
trying to guess which water molecule will crystallize first in water
when temparature is lowered. Some see that event as a surprise,
"tipping point", an unexpected event; the truth of the matter is temp
is low, and at some point, no matter which part of the water
crystallizes first, the whole thing will turn to ice.

We're living in the 'upside down'. Kids can't go to school but I just
saw a job opening for 15 yr olds at the grocery store. Let's put them
at risk of getting a deadly virus delivering canned tuna to rich
people who clap for 2 mins at 7PM but make sure they can't get
educated"

IMO this quantum stuff is a waste of time for Google. This is the sort
of work gov funds. It is very possible the whole thing is a crock,
and might not bring any benefit to any company in near future.

"In this paper I want to present to you my theory explaining why
computationally superior quantum computing is not possible, discuss
the laws of nature that may support this theory, and describe some
potential connections and applications. .. [T]ghe assertion of a paper
published in *Nature* in October 2019, declaring that 'quantum
computational supremacy' was achieved by a team from Google on a
53-qubit computer, seems to refute my argument. We will describe and
give a preliminary evaluation of Google’s claims. ...

My argument against quantum supremacy and quantum error-correction
Here, in brief, is my argument against quantum computers. ...

(A) From the perspective of computational complexity theory, noisy
intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) circuits are low-level classical
computational devices.

(B) Therefore, by naturalness, NISQ systems do not support quantum
supremacy. In other words, the rate of noise cannot be reduced to the
level allowing quantum supremacy.

(C) Achieving good-quality quantum error-correction requires an even lower noise rate
than the one required for achieving quantum supremacy.

(D) Therefore, NISQ systems do not support quantum error-correction.

(E) Hence, large-scale quantum computing based on quantum
error-correction is beyond reach"

Listening to a debate between a BJP rep (nationalist party in India),
and a lady from oppo. At some pt she angrily says, referring to the

probably meant 'boogeyman', came out that way, but with the accent it
was funny. Good-funny.

CleanTechnica: "BP Smacks Exxon Upside Head With New Green Hydrogen
Scheme.. Why, it seems like only yesterday that ExxonMobil was
forecasting a rosy scenario for fossil gas in the sparkling green
economy of the future. Now along comes rival BP with a deep dive into
green hydrogen. Renewable energy is already threatening gas in the
power generation market, and if all goes according to plan renewable
H2 will push gas out of the coveted industrial energy marketplace,
too"

"Well the Euro sucks, what else is there?". Regulation. Trade

I noticed some recurring themes in some journalistic circles related
to EU -- they revolve around "will they unite more?' and 'is this the
end of EU?'  Any new event can trigger this..  Border closures bcz of
COVID..?  IS THIS THE END OF EU?

Mate, the union (and it is a *very* light union) is there bcz it is
beneficial to all parties involved. It will end the moment it stops
being beneficial to those parties. To pinpoint that time, 1 needs to
analyze what made them to come together to begin with..
