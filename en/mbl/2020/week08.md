Political Islam usually degrades into caliphatism as in Ottomuffs,
similar to the centralized, managed Christianity (Catholicism) of Rome
an outgrowth of widespread peasantry and its parasitic mafia - sorry,
empire. The left aspect of religion is quashed. So it makes sense to
keep organized religion at bay, away from state functions.

"Keeping track of freight on thousands of railcars along thousands of
miles of track, maintaining rail beds, keeping engines and cars
repaired, overseeing thousands of employees, and ensuring safe passage
required a new kind of organizational model. Economic historian Alfred
Chandler points out that railroads were the first modern business
enterprise to separate ownership from management. No single family
could underwrite the huge capital costs of building a railroad. So, in
the 1850s, European investment houses began financing
U.S. railroads.60 The operation of the railroads was put under the
stewardship of a new class of professional managers. They created the
precursor of the modern corporation, a centralized, hierarchical
command-and-control mechanism made up of critical decision makers at
the top of the pyramid and middle managers at various rungs who were
responsible for specific day-to-day functions of the organization and
accountable to higher-ups for overall guidance"

"Access to oil became even more important during World War II. Indeed,
the entire strategy of the war revolved around controlling vital oil
supplies...

[Hitler] set [his] sights on a two-pronged approach to securing oil:
first, developing a synthetic-fuel industry at home; and second,
pushing into a war with Russia to secure access to the rich oil fields

"In order to (inconsistently) enforce this labyrinth of red tape,
Bloomberg effectively turned the police into a task force on petty
vice, sending them to write up people for harmless offenses (a move
their union loudly protested). In a 2004 piece for Vanity Fair,
Christopher Hitchens set out on a crime spree across New York where he
tried to break as many of these enforced regulations as possible. This
meant not just lighting up in a bar, but sitting on a milk crate ($105
fine for a Bronx man), feeding pigeons (summons for an 86-year-old),
and riding a bike without both feet on the pedals. Strangely, though
considered crimes against humanity in Bloombergistan, these particular
infractions had nothing to do with public health. What they did have
to do with was fines, which were then used to fill city coffers,
authoritarianism in the service of deficit cutting. This enabled
Bloomberg to boast about his fiscal responsibility even as he presided
over a hefty expansion of the city’s budget"

Last [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2404) I saw on this said
conciousness is not required for the so-called collapse of the wave
function.

Corallary: if this thing "collapses" even for inanimate objects, that
would increase the likelihood of what we see being one version of the
world. Even if you believe collapse is happening, it is happening all
the time, so there aint much motherf--ing wave left to have your
motherf-ing multiverses in.

Reality can still be warped of course, generated from some data
structure, graph, tensor, etc but still, real. As in, not subjective.

"Ocean-going ships could be powered by ammonia within the decade as the
shipping industry takes action to curb carbon emissions.

The chemical - the key ingredient of fertilisers - can be burned in
ships’ engines in place of polluting diesel.

The industry hopes ammonia will help it tackle climate change, because
it burns without CO2 emissions...

But it notes that the near ubiquitous use of ammonia for agriculture
has conveniently generated a global network of ports where the
chemical is traded or stored.

That means the infrastructure for storing chilled ammonia as a
shipping fuel already exists. In the USA, for instance, one existing
ammonia pipeline runs for 2,000 miles...

The engine designer Man Energy Solutions is making a two-stroke
ammonia-powered engine it hopes will be ready by 2024.

The firm’s spokesman, Peter Kirkeby, told the BBC: “We see a very big
interest from the market in ammonia as a fuel – even though there are
challenges.

'We expect the first ships fuelled with ammonia will be existing
tankers that are already transporting ammonia for fertiliser. They
know how to handle it.'"

"Judging by media coverage and the comments of party luminaries, you
might think Democrats are bitterly polarized over Bernie Sanders’s
presidential bid... Since the beginning of the year, news organization
after news organization has speculated that Sanders’s success may set
off a Democratic 'civil war.'

But polls of Democratic voters show nothing of the sort. Among
ordinary Democrats, Sanders is strikingly popular, even with voters

less—than his major competitors. On paper, he appears well positioned

all the talk of civil war? Because Sanders is far more divisive among
Democratic elites—who prize institutional loyalty and ideological
moderation"

This current world is probably a version of be-all end-all dream for
boomers. Products in markets, bunch of roads, cars, etc, especially in
2nd, 3rd world - they didn't have any of these things in such
abundance when they were young. Boy did they get what they
(uncarefully) wished for...

They are about abundance of shit.. not quality. U'd think by now would
all students would be bombarded with such great teaching material
through official channels that they'd only be limited with what they
could absorb. Didn't happen. Quite the opposite, I see majority
struggling to find content, accessing quality teaching. There is huge
indust production, still poverty. Throw away forks and knives, garbage
patch in the Pacific Ocean.

Elections are not about policy accuracy, they are about grand
messages. They are about __selling__, especially for the challenger
(not having a previous term to be judged on).

I am glad Bernie is using a label that specifically ends with the word
socialism, so the emphasis is squarely on that term. This is the best
way to draw a contrast between himself and the establishment whose
meager middle-ground centrism drove Dems to the ground. 

"Why does Bernie call himself democratic socialist when he is actually
a social democrat if we go by policies"

Buy bonds (for good yield) price goes up, yields go down. Low yields
on B-grade bonds means there is a lot of demand for that debt. B-grade
is risky, ppl are hungry.

Bubble in low grade too? 🤔

B-grade junk bond yields are way down, like __way__

Peeps are hungry for yield and flooding this area too of course.

not seem imminent.

I've had a lot of exercise on this area. Tigger nats, among their
other moronic proclaimations, also keep harping abt a "pure tigger"
whose head must be *brachycephalic* in shape (basically a round head,
like Putin's) a feature apparently of "Central Asian origin". A lot
serious people believe this shit, so ~10 yrs ago during my TR blogging
when some high ranking military types mumbled the usual nat stories, I
would just get a photo of them, [measure their
head](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/tr/2008/08/brekisefal-degil_31.html),
and look at the ratio (of height to width). It is always less than
0.85, *not brachycephalic*, then I'd say "well you do not belong to
the Turk race".  Nats start jumping up and down.. These ppl are deeply
delusional. Which describes nationalism well actually - a shared delusion.

In many ways Warren's strategy, path to nom was the hardest.. Her plan
hinged on taking progressives from Bernie (they shared a base) which
she succeeded for a while, use that momentum to gobble up centrists,

did, it was game over. Not to nag, she obviously has prog creds. But

Douhat: "But Democrats considering this sales pitch should be very
clear on what a Bloomberg presidency would mean. Bloomberg does not
have Trump’s flagrant vices (though some of his alleged behavior with
women is pretty bad) or his bald disdain for norms and rules and legal
niceties, and so a Bloomberg presidency will feel less institutionally
threatening, less constitutionally perilous, than the ongoing wildness
of the Trump era — in addition to delivering at least some of the
policy changes that liberals and Democrats desire.

However, feelings can be deceiving. Trump’s authoritarian tendencies
are naked on his Twitter feed, but Bloomberg’s imperial instincts, his
indifference to limits on his power, are a conspicuous feature of his
career. Trump jokes about running for a third term; Bloomberg actually
managed it, bulldozing through the necessary legal changes. Trump
tries to bully the F.B.I. and undermine civil liberties; Bloomberg ran
New York as a miniature surveillance state. Trump has cowed the
Republican Party with celebrity and bombast; Bloomberg has spent his
political career buying organizations and politicians that might
otherwise impede him. Trump blusters and bullies the press; Bloomberg
literally owns a major media organization. Trump has Putin envy;
Bloomberg hearts Xi Jinping"

Dont look to capitalists for the two-step solutions. They can only do
their thing in their little sandboxes where resources, talent, inno
are prepared for them. Bezos let that slip recently while talking abt
his space plans, that Amazon was built on an existing infrastructure
of Internet, delivery, products. His point was abt having to build
same type of infra for space so companies can innovate, but we see the
logic here...

Jobs was the same way. He would expand great effort in finding the
right component companies, for the iPhone, iPod, notebooks but that
doesn't change the fact is nearly all significant tech in today's
smartphones is tied to gov research.
