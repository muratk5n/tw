"[A] new chemistry has entered the fray, with battery startup EnerVenue
launching today with $12 million in seed funding.

The company is betting on the success of metal hydrogen batteries,
specifically nickel-hydrogen batteries. This chemistry .. was always
held back from greater commercial success due to its high
price. .. EnerVenue ..  has been able to achieve commercialization via
'a breakthrough competitive price using new low-cost materials.' The
company was able to do this by working with EEnotech, a startup that
incubates and accelerates nanotechnology-driven solutions to, among
other things, grid-scale energy storage. ...

Unlike lithium-ion, the company claims that metal-hydrogen batteries
excel operating in conditions of extreme heat and extreme
cold. Specifically, the solution operates optimally from -40° to 140°F
ambient temperatures. Because of this, the battery comes with no risk
of fire or thermal runaway and also includes no toxic materials,
making it recyclable, a huge tip in its favor, as recycling of
materials is only going to grow in importance as the renewable energy
industry grows and evolves. ...

EnerVenue claims that the company’s batteries have a more than 30-year
lifespan, can go through more than 30,000 cycles without experiencing
degradation and offer exceptional overcharge, overdischarge, and
deep-cycle capabilities.

The company also claims cost-per-kilowatt-hour as low as a penny, as
well as capital expenditure costs that beat lithium-ion. The company
stresses its use of low-cost materials."

"'As an example of metal hydrogen batteries, nickel-hydrogen batteries
have proven to be an incredibly powerful energy storage technology –
albeit an expensive one – for the aerospace industry over the past 40
years, .. [t]he performance and longevity of nickel-hydrogen batteries
is well-established and second to none. We’re now able to deliver the
same performance and durability at a breakthrough competitive price
using new low-cost materials.' [says EverVenue founder]."

Math is a tool, we made it up. Infinity is a tool. Imaginery numbers
are a tool. But nature at its core is probably discrete, and math does
connect with nature well. How come?  Well the root of all math is also
discrete -- sets and number theory.

Always good idea to keep tabs on wronged people, resentment, anger for
social analysis and prediction. Ex; Amazon had a pricing war with
diapers.com, put them out of business. Its founder started a new thing
acquired by Walmart, he now works for Walmart and *runs all their
U.S. e-commerce operations*. This guy must be PISSED, and now in a
position to even the score. His business was destroyed by Amazon now
he works for the competitor. U watch this guy and his drama.

MSM gaslights bcz if they talked abt what is truly going on, then
someone could ask 'well how the f--k did left issues end up in the
GOP, why are they not in the Democratic Party?". That is too close for
comfort now.. Then you have to talk about how centrism fucked up for
decades, how unwanted ideological parts landed with a random outsider
who brought it to the GOP.

The gaslighting on Russiagate serves the same purpose. If DJT win
wasn't through "illegal means", then the next question is how did this
guy win legally?

We've been in second wave for three centuries now. Given that
structure, there can't be too many wildly, untried solutions. The
means of production dictates certain disconnection, disparate parts
needs to be reconnected, through integrators, implying government,
that needs taxes. The natural next question is *how high* taxes?

Someone says low, someone says high. Two options.

After 2016 the talk was abt this "brand new politics", "right
populism". So I waited to hear details... Bannon for example. U
wait.. U wait.. then boom -- word came out he wanted high taxes on the
rich.

That's left bitch!

"You just can’t fill a battery .. any truck that wants over a 500-mile
range, you’re looking at least at a 1,000-kilowatt battery. That’s a
lot of weight. That’s a lot of energy. And to charge it, if you want
to do that in 15 minutes you’re going to need a 4-megawatt
charger. That’s massive and I can only imagine what that looks like
with regards to cable, or just the capacity required to get that
energy to a truck."

Forget 5G. Let's use this.

"University College London (UCL) has recorded the world’s fastest data
transmission speed, reaching 178 terabits a second -or 178,000,000
megabits a second- by using a bandwidth of 16.8 THz.

At double the capacity of any system currently deployed in the world,
the speed was close to the theoretical limit of data transmission set
out by American mathematician Claude Shannon in 1949.

The record was achieved by a research team led by Dr Lidia Galdino
(pictured), lecturer at UCL and Royal Academy of Engineering research
fellow, in collaboration with Xtera and KDDI Research.

Not only did they achieve the speeds – outperforming the previous
record set by researchers in Japan by one fifth – the team also found
such speeds could be deployed on already existing infrastructure.

In 'real terms', 178 terabits a second is so fast it would be possible
to download the entire Netflix library in less than a second.  ..

The record was achieved by transmitting data through a much wider
range of colours of light, or wavelengths, than is typically used in
optical fibre"

In 1968 Carl Sagan was denied tenure at his university. Let that sink
in, CS, one of the best explainers of science, a visible scientific
personality, was denied tenure. They were correct in doing so, "being
an explainer" doesn't mean a research is being furthered in any
front. TAlking to bunch of uninformed people, "popularizing" is not
research. It could be inspiring people, but that's about it. You can't
do science by publicity.

People wld still suffer, bcz of the shortcomings of the market, sure,

McCain and Romney were both close to libertards, but their elec loss
doesnt mean the mov is discredited. 2008 crisis wouldnt happen in a
truly market econ, libertards hate them. Fenni Mae and Freddie Mac are
*centrist* institutions. Part gov, part market, little in, little out,
doing massive securitization with gov guarantee.. how is this not a
f-ing abomination, hallmark of centrism?

---

Distinct right needs to exist just like distinct left. Going lukewarm
on each issue (centrism) doesn't work. Mixing distinct issues from
each side doesn't work (fascism). Clear-cut ideology needs to be in
different parties. We need tards in GOP being against excessive
regulation, pro-market, etc.. and a left party being opposite of that.

---

I bash libertards sometimes but they should be in charge of the
Republican Party. And moving towards distinct ideologies was taking
place actually, The Tea Party movement was all about this, no? But GOP
got sidetracked from that somehow (bcz of fear? but then ended with
something far worse, in their eyes).

Scientists then were essentially looking at a 2D projection of a 3D
system, which they did not know but had to reason about
mathematically. They had to be a mathematical detective. *This* is
science. None of that process is thought, or even hinted at, at
schools, even to kids who can grasp it. What we teach today is
cargo-cult science, even if the material is the outcome of real
science.

---

Teaching science wout teaching how scientist came up with that
science, makes zero sense. Now we know about planets, orbits, our
sun-centric system, we see pictures like the one below all over the
place, in many books thanks to the scientist that led to them.

But that's not what they themselves saw in the sky. When they looked,
for example at Mars, over many days, this is what they saw,

<img width="340" src="https://external-preview.redd.it/XJ4ccZlh33IP9nQrp5nzGb-N-bXUKoiND4rjWbwrd-8.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6f11fbd1a9de1ed103ecf44a58995fd2c71f9160"/>

This is 2D. Bunch of dots on a (sky) screen. How do you get to the
first picture from the second? How did Copernicus do it? This was the
biggest detective story of the ancient times. Skipping that train of
thought is a disservice too all students.

Not bad. 

"Isaac Newton estimated, without access to reliable measurement, that
the density of Earth would be five or six times as great as the
density of water, which is surprisingly accurate (the modern value is
5.515). Newton under-estimated the Earth's volume by about 30%, so
that his estimate would be roughly equivalent to 4.2±0.5 × 10^24 kg"
