Reuters: "Hydrogen has long been touted as a clean alternative to
fossil fuels. Now, as major economies prepare green investments to
kickstart growth, advocates spy a golden chance to drag the niche
energy into the mainstream of a post-pandemic world.

Green hydrogen was pushed to the fore last week when Fatih Birol, head
of the International Energy Agency, said the technology was "ready for
the big time" and urged governments to channel investments into the
fuel"

EU’s Energy Cief Simson: "Central to energy system integration is the
deployment of new fuel sources... This has the potential to be a game
changer,” Simson said. “It could act as an enabler, especially for the
hard-to-decarbonise sectors like heavy industry and transport”.

Molecular energy carriers – or gases – are easier to use in sectors
like heavy-duty transport where the weight of batteries makes
electrification inconvenient. Molecules are also used as a feedstock
for industries like steel-making or fertiliser production"

Finkel: "I want my phone to take my complex questions, interpret them
locally without ever seeking advice from a cloud-based server, and
then anonymously reach out to the cloud to get the answers to what I
need.

AI on my device, not in the cloud...

In fact, I know we have the capacity to ‘make it so’.

Last year, I attended a government summit called Techtonic hosted by
Minister Karen Andrews.

It was there I first learned about Home Guardian, an Australian
company with a very simple system that has the potential to
revolutionise the aged care, disability and hospital sectors.

Using a world-first artificial intelligence device, Home Guardian uses
sensors to monitor movement. It alerts carers or family members, via
text message, if an unexplained fall occurs – all without being
connected to the internet, without consulting an external server,
without compromising privacy.

AI on my device, not in the cloud"

AU Chief Scientist Finkel: "When I use my iPhone, I say 'Siri, call my
wife, Elizabeth Finkel'. And Siri very happily replies 'calling
Elizabeth Finkel'.

And it works really well, unless of course I am in an underground car
park. In that case, Siri goes silent before sheepishly saying “Uh oh,
I’m having trouble connecting”.

What this tells me is that the speech processing is not being
performed on my iPhone.

Instead, my instruction goes to a server – a gigantic computer in the
United States – that processes my words and sends them back to my
iPhone as digital instructions rather than the original audio.

Nearly everything you do on your smartphone is stored, deconstructed
and analysed by servers devoid of any morals"

Muller-Plantenberg thesis: "However, studying the episode in a bit
more detail, two kind of doubts emerge. The first one has to do with
the way the exchange rate is determined in the Mundell-Fleming
framework. The real exchange rate enters the model only in [some]
equation .. as a determinant of the current account. However, how the
exchange rate is itself set is not modelled explicitly. Essentially,
what the model is telling us is that the exchange rate has to adjust
itself at all times to obtain macroeconomic equilibrium and to ensure
that the current account reaches a level compatible with that
equilibrium.

The logic goes backward, not forward—similar to the argument one
sometimes hears: 'We have a current account deficit. A deficit cannot
go on forever but must revert to balance (or to some long-run
equilibrium) one day. Therefore, the exchange rate needs to
depreciate.' Most economics students find it hard to under­stand why
speculators in the foreign exchange market should at all be bothered
to please macroeconomists and to restore macroeconomic equilibrium in
this fashion.  And they are probably not alone."

At high echelons of science if you have something good you will get
your audience. If you didnt, there is something wrong with your
theory, or something wrong with you. Don't try to appeal "to the
public", "build a movement" who wont understand a f-ing word of your
jargon anyway. Like this Sean Carroll guy and his theory... How will
speaking abt it on a podcast help you with that, except
self-aggrandizement, and/or more movie screenplay deals?

Haha.. same page talks abt a documentary called "Meat the Future".

---

"Conventional [meat prod] methods rely on the intensive confinement
[of animals] in unsanitary and inhumane facilities. These unnatural
conditions require extensive use of antibiotics to address diseases
that proliferate among the crowded, stressed animals, contributing to
the spread of drug-resistant superbugs.

Since cultured meat is grown in a sterile environment, there is less
chance for pathogens to sneak in. This decreases the need for
antibiotics, as well as the risk of products containing
illness-causing bacteria such as salmonella and listeria"

Pierini: "[O]ne can’t ignore economic fundamentals. Turkey is a deficit country and relies heavily on the West, primarily Europe, for its export of manufactured goods, its import of technology, and its financial needs, both in terms of short-term and direct investment. China, Russia, and the Gulf countries are not alternatives to Turkey’s European anchor. Even when Qatar or China is willing to help Turkey economically, this is not commensurate with the country’s current financial gap. Besides, beyond hopes, a functioning European economic anchor requires two features that Ankara cannot currently provide—the rule of law as well as respect and dialogue"

"[Bancor's] Clearing Union would grant credit in the form of overdraft
facilities. In other terms, each member would have the possibility of
financing a trade deficit simply by entering a negative balance on its
account. Symmetrically, a country with a trade surplus would have a
positive balance credited to its account. Hence, for example, an
export from country A to country B financed by the Clearing Union
would give rise to the simultaneous registration of two entries of
equal amount: a credit to the account of A and a debit to the account
of B. Thanks to the centralization of all accounts at the Clearing
Union, however, the credit and debit would not be bilateral, but
multilateral positions, of each country vis‐à‐vis all the other
members as a whole. In other terms, the surplus country A could spend
its credit in bancor not only with B, but with any other member
country; and B could reduce its debit by exporting towards any other
country. In this way, the Clearing Union would be able, in principle,
to finance international trade and its expansion, without the need of
any given amount of money.

Bancor is not a fiat money. To be sure, it is created ex nihilo. And
yet its creation does not depend on the decision of a central
authority"

There can be a "school" but in a postmodern reincarnation it would
mostly be a loungy area, a cross between a Starbucks and a mall. There
can be play areas, study areas where some professional grown-ups can
donate time as "groundkeepers" making sure kids are silent. They can
be certified on the e-material as well, by the DOeD, so they can
answer questions. But they should not teach. Feynman should teach your

There. Paper saz minimum cost net flow is $O(m^{3/2})$ where m is

---

Hmm. I bet shortest path prob as a minimum cost network flow, which in
the backend solved as LP, implemented through log-barrier and solved
in continuous realm with Newton steps etc works faster.

LPs are convex, solved problem.

Incidence matrix for SP is sparse. I've never seen such optimization
probs taking more than 15 steps, so O(1). Sparse matrix inversion,
banded, structured is O(n) (needed for Newton steps). So I bet that
V^2 is beatable.

NYT: "The problem, Garrett added, is bigger than Trump and older than
his presidency. America has never been sufficiently invested in public
health. The riches and renown go mostly to physicians who find new and
better ways to treat heart disease, cancer and the like. The big
political conversation is about individuals’ access to health care.

But what about the work to keep our air and water safe for everyone,
to design policies and systems for quickly detecting outbreaks,
containing them and protecting entire populations? Where are the
rewards for the architects of that?

Garrett recounted her time at Harvard. 'The medical school is all
marble, with these grand columns,” she said. “The school of public
health is this funky building, the ugliest possible architecture, with
the ceilings falling in.'"

'That’s America?' I asked.

It's true. That's why I changed my publishing system, all content you
now see are the product of text files, typed in a very simple markdown
format, that I "check in" to my own local code repository. I sync that
repo with a remote one, to publish, which has an added web page
generation ability from that remote repo from markdown, but that func
can be replicated elsewhere. The point is I own all the base
content. It's all based on simple files.

Reading Snowden's book made me remember the good old times of the Net,
I am also very much a product of that era as he is.

Snowden, *Permanent Record* - "Now, it was the creative Web that
collapsed [after 90s], as countless beautiful, difficult,
individualistic websites were shuttered. The promise of convenience
led people to exchange their personal sites—which demanded constant
and laborious upkeep—for a Facebook page and a Gmail account. The
appearance of ownership was easy to mistake for the reality of it. Few
of us understood it at the time, but none of the things that we’d go
on to share would belong to us anymore."

Gelman: "Overall, the new [Updated Santa Clara coronavirus report] is
stronger than the old, because it includes more data summaries and
more evidence regarding the all-important specificity number."

The math looks tight -
[PDF](https://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/79576.pdf). I
would forgo the analytic solutions just solve everything
numerically. Data ref would be nice.

Muller-Plantenberg: "[Researchers found that ] a small set of
variables–including the current account as a percentage of GDP, export
growth, international reserves and short-term foreign debt relative to
reserves–do a very good job in predicting the EMS crisis in 1992–1993,
the Mexican crisis in 1994–1995 as well as the Asian crisis in 1997"

Effin Russkies. We all know it, there is this sheer mental rawpower
coming out of these muthafukkas, it is a joke almost in science
circles. Boyd from Stanford was talking about a new area, says 'one
day someone will find a result for it..' then says 'and I bet that
person will be a Russian' half-jokingly and laughs. It's true. Is it
the extreme cold..? Nothing else to do, either drink vodka or study.

"St Petersburg University students develop a hydrogen fuel cell ..

‘The most important thing for a catalyst is that it should not be very
expensive and should have a high power output per square
centimetre. You can increase this useful surface through porosity,’
explains Stepan Danilov. ‘Knowing this, we used nanostructured
nickel. It resembles Raney nickel, but we managed to make the material
even more porous. In order to further increase the activity of the
catalyst, we introduced platinum nano points into it - they are so
small that they have little or no effect on the cost of the fuel
cell. This allows our project to compete with lithium-ion batteries in
terms of price and performance.

The hydrogen fuel cell prototypes for quadrotors last two to three
times longer due to their higher capacity. While the operating
temperature of lithium-ion batteries ranges from minus 20 °C to plus
60 °C, the hydrogen fuel cells developed by the Hydrogen Express team
have a much larger operating temperature range – from minus 60 °C to
plus 80 °C.

According to the team members, modern hydrogen fuel cells are quite
comparable in terms of safety with internal combustion engines, but
unlike them and lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells do not harm
the environment"

New PMI is [out](../../2021/01/stats.html#pmi), major fall,

```
2020-03-01    49.1
2020-04-01    41.5
```

Anything below 50 is bad. 

Since Manuf PMI is a [leading indicator](../../2021/01/stats.html#gdpism)
of GDP, expect that to fall further as well. So, that red line will
follow that blue line. Then we get ka-booom.

When econ types go all hi-tech "solutionist" things get ridiculous

"@Jkylebass

This is happening all over the globe. China threatened to withhold
medicine to the US for the Wuhan Virus naming convention. They
threatened Europe with the same for demanding an investigation into
origins and actions of the virus.  Now, they threaten on changing
office name ?
