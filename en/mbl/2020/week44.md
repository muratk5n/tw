Corollary: True change happens top-down, not bottom-up.

---

They can gauge whether they are doing good or bad and vote for the
'other' if bad (enough for democracy to work).

Spin is short term. Bad policies sink, good policies raise -- in the
long run, through their outcomes. If ur party is constantly putting up
bad policies, ppl might choose 'other' on you more than the next
guy. Also if major blocs are all failing constantly u might get the
occasional fascist who'll run roughshod over the whole thing. That,
noone wants.

---

[Exactly](2015/09/the-logic-of-political-survival-mesquita.html#elections). People don't
know shit.  That's why you dont put them on the spot for specific
policy (see Brexit).  

"Are you saying you can 'spin' people? They are not wise processors of
information?"

---

It could work.. the spin that is. Im not sure Dems want anything
passed that wld help Trump before election anyway.

"In many of the competitive races, Republicans have risked their seats
by jamming through the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney
Barrett [.. m]eanwhile, a desperately needed stimulus bill continues
to languish. This is precisely the message Senate Democrats used to
make the four-day Barrett hearings into a advertisement against Senate
Republicans"

At another level anti-semitism is Labor's Russiagate. It unites
certain people, against certain other people.... It serves a
purpose. Obviously, just like Russiagate, is is based on half-truths,
a warped version of reality. The issue is now a code word, a
fraternity secret handshake of sorts.

Give it enough time even Americans would become like that... Remember

---

Of course. Because they know Israel better!

Brits have some history in the area, hence the knowledge about these
things are more widespread, so their left is naturally more vocal
about it.

"But isn't it true there has been more pointed criticism of Israel in
UK, especially in Labor?"

magnesium or aluminium. Professor Kondo-Francois Aguey-Zinsou, chief

Plug Power CEO: "Power Density and Range: fuel cell energy density is
four times more than batteries, and a tank of hydrogen contains more
than double the energy of a battery at the same weight. Fuel cells
allow easy scalability for users to increase range without the
elimination of cargo space. This is important in middle-mile and
long-haul green mobility markets.  In these applications, you must
double the batteries on board to double the range of a
battery-electric vehicle. With fuel cells, to double the range, you
only have to add more hydrogen.  That supports a 50-60% increase in
payload versus battery electric vehicles"

The Independent, 2015: "Schools are using 'dubious practices' and even
cheating to achieve better performance results because of the intense
pressure of the Government’s test and exam system, a major study for
the largest teaching union has found. ...

The study concluded there was 'evidence that teachers in England are
‘gaming the system’, because they are under pressure to achieve good
results. In some cases they are being told to cheat. Such practices
are increasing in response to the intense pressure on school leaders
and teachers to raise attainment as measured by tests and exams.'"

They discovered a method to produce a cheap catalyst that performs as
well as current methods, but based on tungsten.

"[E]lectrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as one of the
most important and sustainable processes for the hydrogen
production. Because of the low HER kinetics, it is necessary to use
high efficiency electrocatalysts to increase the overall process
efficiency. ...

Here, we report a simple and scalable plasma dynamic synthesis method
to form composite containing the single-crystalline nanosized cubic
tungsten carbide embedded in the carbon matrix (WC 1-x @C), which was
studied in HER both in the pure form and modified with some Pt by wet
impregnation method. It was found that even by adding 1 wt % platinum,
it is possible to significantly increase the catalytic activity of the
WC 1-x @C composite, while with the addition of 10% platinum allows
reaching almost the same properties as for commercial Pt/C sample"

How to understand a certain country with dumb ni--rs at the helm..
You start with a child. What does a child want? Wants to do grown-up
things, right. Drive like one, be like one.

like this kid, with imaginary steering wheel, and make car sounds
"wroomm wrooom". In gov that'll be vevy vevy big bridges, vevy vevy
big wars... wout knowing whether these things are useful or not. This

They are very similar. With golf you sorta walk around too, like
regular daily life chill, then you go to a certain point, stop,
concenrate, strain.. strain.. Boom!

That's exactly like taking a shit.

I had many spirited debates about censorship in the TYT studio, I was
warning that being pro-censorship will always come back to bite the
left even harder. Reminder: No matter how much you hate someone who is
speaking, the antidote to bad speech is more speech, not censorship.

Making something float is much easier than making it sink. Calcs for a
platform... 3x2x8 meter design, with two stacks of empty barrels in
it, pour concrete over it, put a **ton** of weight on top, this
conrete slab would still float. 

Barrel, 0.16 m^3, concrete density 2400 kg / m3.

```python
w = 3; h = 2; l = 8
concw = (w*h*l - w*1.2*l) * 2400
concv = w*h*l
ow = 1000.0
"%0.2f, %0.2f" % (concw+ow, concv*1000.0)
```

"Recycling lithium" is a non-starter for another reason. Reserves are
limited, as in insufficient, and since recycling does not magically
create new reserves, the main problem remains unresolved. Not enough
fucking lithium.

Trek isn't about the "Federation" necessarily either.. How do these
fools at Bad Reboot (a JJ outfit) watch these shows? With eyes closed?
They seem to have perfected the "superficial pay homage" move, e.g. in
*Into the Darkness* Khan says "my name is Khan" veery deliberately, BR
is like ok, u remember that right, I pressed that button now we are
okay? That was cool right..? Like it's a fan thing..? It's not a fan
thing. Roddenberry's creation is the whole package, not some building,
or some word you pay random homage to.

Earth surface area (including sea) 510.1 million km².

How much area for 1 person?

```python
area = ( 510.1  / (7.5 * 1e3) * 1e6  ) 
print ("%.2f m2" %  area )
print ("side %.2f m" %  np.sqrt(area) )
```

```text
68013.33 m2
side 260.79 m
```

Not too wide of an area.. a square with one side 260 meters..

Lota people.

I cannot believe post 911 was spent on such shoddy-ass solutions on
the climate. Pursued BTW by ppl who were seen as "smart" too. Simple
arithmetic could have shown what's what... So sad.

IMO there will come a time when Russia will actively be involved
