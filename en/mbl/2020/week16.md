[searching..] Dilma becomes Prez. Ah. Well.. it looks like a huge peak

"[A] reader from Down Under pointed me to recent research by
Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation (CSIRO) that promises to address many of my concerns
regarding hydrogen distribution by making hydrogen from ammonia at the
pump.

These days hydrogen is typically shipped in ready-to-use liquid or gas
form, but the liquifying process consumes 30 percent of its eventual
energy content, and further losses occur from inevitable boil-off in
transit. What the Aussies are proposing is to transport it as liquid
ammonia and then convert it to hydrogen at the point of sale. Fun
fact: The density of hydrogen in liquid ammonia is about 45 percent
greater than in pure liquid hydrogen(!).

Oz has access to far more renewable energy than it knows what to do
with. It's the globe's most solar-energy-rich country, receiving
between 7-8 kW-hr/square meter of solar irradiation per day across the
entire continent; there's also abundant ocean tide energy and plenty
of wind, as well. So the government is keen to export that green
energy, and easily transportable liquid ammonia produced without
generating any CO2 looks like a great way to do so.

Most ammonia produced today involves hydrocarbon feedstocks and hence
produces CO2. CSIRO proposes producing hydrogen by electrolyzing water
and combining it with nitrogen separated from air. These gases are
then compressed and fed into the same Haber-Bosch synthesis reactor
used for hydrocarbon-based ammonia production (which involves
iron-based catalysts, temperatures of 750-930 degrees, and pressures
of 2,200-3,600 psi). Total energy input is roughly 10-12
kW-hr/kilogram of ammonia—all of it clean.

There are no ocean-going hydrogen tanker ships, but ammonia is
routinely shipped by sea. Now CSIRO, in conjunction with Fortescue
Metals Group, has developed a novel two-step process to convert
ammonia into pure hydrogen gas"

Hey.. if A.C. is on this thing, watch out

"One of the most attractive features of hydrogen technology as an energy carrier is its adaptability and versatility. Furthermore, existing infrastructure can produce, store, and transport energy in multiple ways, and hydrogen can be extracted from renewable and non-renewable resources. Hydrogen can also be converted to methane and electricity to power homes, or transformed into fuel for mobility. Hydrogen is one of the preferred options for storing excess energy produced from renewables—using water electrolysis technology, excess renewable electricity is used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, which can then be stored in tanks. Hydrogen gas has the highest energy content of any fuel, as it has the capability to store substantial amounts of energy in a small amount of hydrogen. As a result, the technology is projected to be a low-cost option for energy storage over extended periods of time, making renewables a more attractive energy source for widespread adoption"

"Redox-Flow Cell Stores Renewable Energy as Hydrogen

A redox-flow battery, in essence a reversible fuel cell, is typically
made up of a positive and negative electrolyte stored in two separate
tanks. When the liquids are pumped into the battery cell stack
situated between the tanks, a redox reaction occurs, and generates
electricity at the battery’s electrodes...

The new redox-flow cell performed well in lab tests, exhibiting a
charge capacity of up to one ampere per square centimeter, a ten-fold
increase over normal flow batteries. It was also able to withstand

Woa... shortest path problems are indeed solveable as LPs - just
solved one. And LP's internally use continuous methods, as in interior
point styles..barrier, do Newton.. So a discrete prob solvable in
continuous realm. No need for discreteness, loops, stacks and queues
and shit.. Very awesome 🖖.

Rodrik: "COVID-19 may well not alter – much less reverse – tendencies
evident before the crisis. Neoliberalism will continue its slow
death. Populist autocrats will become even more
authoritarian. Hyper-globalization will remain on the defensive as
nation-states reclaim policy space. China and the US will continue on
their collision course. And the battle within nation-states among
oligarchs, authoritarian populists, and liberal internationalists will
intensify"

If this shit is sooo intrinsicly valueable why did UK, the inventor of

are barking up the wrong tree - this thing is just another commodity
(perhaps even worse than some other commodities), you buy it when the
price seems favorable, and sell if there are enough morons willing to
pay. But there is no value in it, if enough ppl favored sock puppets,
sock puppets could be a 'store of value'.

"Lengthening Patent Terms by 10 Years is Exactly the Wrong Response to
COVID-19

Governments around the world are taking steps to make sure that
private corporations don’t use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse
to make unjustified monopoly profits. They’re doing that by ensuring
that governments can override patents and issue compulsory licenses
for COVID-19 related treatments, vaccines, and tools. Canada’s recent
COVID-19 bill authorizes the government to make and use patented
inventions as needed in fighting the pandemic. Governments in Chile,
Ecuador, Germany, and Israel have taken similar steps.

But in the U.S., lobbyists and lawyers for patent owners are pushing
our government to move in the exact opposite direction"

"But Jesus was not killed by the emperor himself..!".  Sure, but
Pontius Pilate, his governor ordered his execution - so the system
killed him.

This confirms my thesis that Jesus, Moses were political leaders, and
speficially left politicians of their day. The billionaires, the ppl
in power at the time were the pharoah, the ceasar, Ottocroc sultan -
i.e. ancient mafia.  Jesus, Moses butted heads with this system, and
were promptly persecuted. An unfair system can only be possible with
large landowners present BTW, a direct extension of an agrarian
structures - a 16K year old construction at max.

These left leaders spoke of economic matters, but later their message
was coopted by "elders", morphing the message into moralistic issues,
perfectly in line with pre-Jesus, Moses paganist rituals when the
majority worshipped ancestor bones due to inheritance worries, again,
farm related and sacrificed young children.

"'The Christianity we know today is not the Christianity of Jesus,'
says Professor Hudson.  Indeed the Judaism that we know today is not
the Judaism of Jesus either. The economist told Renegade Inc the
Lord’s Prayer, ‘forgive us our sins even as we forgive all who are
indebted to us’, refers specifically to debt.

'Most religious leaders say that Christianity is all about sin, not
debt,' he says. 'But actually, the word for sin and debt is the same
in almost every language.'

'Schuld', in German, means ‘debt’ as well as 'offense' or, 'sin'. It’s
'devoir' in French. It had the same duality in meaning in the
Babylonian language of Akkadian.”

The idea harks back to the concept of ‘wergeld’, which existed in
parts of Europe and Babylonia, and set the value of a human life based
on their rank, paid as compensation to the family of someone who has
been injured or killed.

'The payment – the Schuld or obligation – expiates you of the injury
caused by the offense,' Dr Hudson said.

The Ten Commandments were about debt.

People tend to think of the Commandment ‘do not covet your neighbour’s
wife’ in purely sexual terms but actually, the economist says it
refers specifically to creditors who would force the wives and
daughters of debtors into sex slavery as collateral for unpaid debt"

"@realSarahPolley

1/ This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

2/ Unsurprising that this movie doesn’t work – the screenplay was a
dog’s breakfast.

3/So much heavy handed foreshadowing. The apocalyptic footage from
Wuhan, the super villain American president, the whistleblower dying,
the Russia/China border closed while people still claimed it was just
a flu, the warnings unheeded. Insulting to the audience's intelligence

4/And then – that most annoying of horror/disaster movie tropes – the
hapless idiots walking into disaster after disaster, all of which the
audience can see coming from a mile away.

5/The over the top details of world leaders and their wives falling
ill, the far fetched idea that industrialized countries wouldn’t have
proper protective gear for front line workers and
ventilators. Pleeeeaaase. This movie needed a script doctor.

6/ This movie even tries to cram in a political agenda – an
on-the-nose critique of what capitalism looks like at its
worst. States competing for ventilators, the rich sheltering in lovely
places while the poor are trapped or still at work in unsafe
environments.

7/And the dystopian angle of this movie? The elderly have become so
disposable that young people still get together and party? No matter
how bad the world is, no one could believe we could ever get to that
point.

8/I don’t know who approved this script. I don’t know who thought it
was in shape to be released. People are just desperate for content I
guess"

Industrialized meat is fine; efficient, clean if inspected
properly. Stay away from freaky wild animals.

We also increasingly subtitute knowledge in place of hard materials
during Third Wave - plastics, for instance, are a complete
fabrication, a material that does not exist in nature. Constructing
meat from its base essentials, without animals, will be IMO the new
way we increasingly eat meat.

"The Case Against Wet Markets.. Live wildlife, however, is too risky
to remain at wet markets. “The lowest-hanging fruit to lessen the
likelihood of future pandemics is to close those markets where we have
large congregations of wild species for commercial purposes,” Steven
Osofsky, a professor of wildlife health"

Not cool. This guy is American, by citizenship and by culture. 

"The Trump campaign probably never expected to feature [Gary Locke]
either. But there he is, in a brief clip included in a montage of the
former vice president meeting with various Chinese officials. Locke is
standing between two Chinese flags (and next to an American
one). Biden is walking toward him, with his head bowed in a way that
makes him look deferential.It’s a standard theatrical move that Biden
often does when he sees old political allies. And Locke is an old
Biden ally.

But he isn’t Chinese. He’s Chinese American. And though the photo was
taken at an event in Beijing, it was taken while Locke was serving in
the same administration as Biden—as the American ambassador to
China. Before that, he was the first Asian American governor of a
state not called Hawaii. A section of the Wing Luke Museum of the
Asian Pacific American Experience in Seattle is devoted to him.[Read:
Meet Gary Locke, America’s new ambassador to China]In other words:
Locke is not a Chinese official, as the Trump campaign made him out to
be, apparently because of the way he looks and because he was standing
next to a Chinese flag.'It is racial stereotyping at its worst. Asian
Americans—whether you’re second-, third-, or fourth-generation, will
always be viewed as foreigners,' Locke told me today. 'We don’t say
that about second- or third-generation Irish Americans or Polish
Americans. No one would even think to include them in a picture when
you’re talking about foreign government officials.'

Locke is justifiably bewildered by being thrown into the middle of the
campaign. “For a lot of Asian Americans, it’s not surprising, but it
is disheartening,” he said.[Read: The other problematic
outbreak]Locke’s father was part of the Normandy invasion, then was
ordered along with the rest of the Fifth Armored Division to the
Battle of the Bulge"
