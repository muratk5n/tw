<p>"Right populism sounds like fascism"</p>

<p>Noone sits around and defines these nice little categories for people
to fall into; politicians (therefore the people) naturally gravitate
towards certain blocks bcz of certain optimality. A hard-ass parent,
tough, strict with their children, would this person be more "work
till you die" type of person in his economics, or otherwise? The
categories arise naturally. If the natural categories are not
followed, take that as a sign of fail, artificiality in the system. </p>

<p>The grid is inefficient as hell. De-electrification is needed.</p>
<hr />
<p>#disruptTheGrid</p>
<p>"I'm most interested in seeing how Bloom Energy can potentially solve
two problems at once with a new strategy. The company recently
announced a new solid oxide electrolyzer that it expects to have
available in 2021. In its simplest form, an electrolyzer simply uses
energy (usually electricity) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen
atoms. It's the reverse of the chemical reaction that takes place in a
fuel cell.</p>
<p>The reason electrolyzers are important for energy is that -- if
they're cost-effective -- they could essentially make fossil fuels
obsolete by creating clean, abundant fuel. Water is abundant, and
there's more than enough wind and solar energy to replace all fossil
fuels, so clean energy isn't a problem either. Bloom Energy plans to
use this fuel for its backup markets, but it could also be used in
large ships currently being developed by Samsung Heavy Industries and
Bloom Energy. This could disrupt shipping as well as the grid"</p>

governance models—one is generally free and open and the other is
authoritarian and closed. Each threatens the other, not necessarily
because of the foreign-policy choices the leaders make, but because of
what the governments are at their core. Beijing believes that the
freedom of the press, the internet, social media, NGOs, economic
interdependence, and exchange programs all have the potential to
undermine their regime. They are not wrong. Indeed, many Americans saw
this as a positive side effect of engagement. Many Americans rightly
understand that China’s authoritarian model has negative externalities
that threaten U.S. interests and freedoms. Tools of repression
domestically find their way overseas. Beijing seeks to censor all
criticism of its regime by coercing other governments, companies, and
individuals. It sucks up data on foreign citizens. It employs
mercantilist techniques to pursue dominance of new technologies. China
is actively seeking to eviscerate liberal norms around human rights,
anti-corruption, and freedom of speech. The regime interferes in
democracies to advance its interests. Neither side can accommodate the
other without compromising the essence of its system"</p>

Like a <em>Starship Troopers</em> but for computer simulation.</p>

<p>They might have tried to pander little bit, bad guy attacks "the
East", which is behind a wall, their leader looks Asian, but it's good
action movie, which means it talks to something human. You can't lay
it on too thick and expect it to be a good movie.</p>

<p>That amt of lithium can destabilize countries (Bolivia?). This tech
needs to be buried. Not fit for use anything other than quick
buffering of energy, in small amounts.</p>
<hr />
<p>Even if battery makers removed <strong>all</strong> cobalt, the remaining issue is
lithium. Then we have 8-15 kg vs 0.007 kg of rare earth usage. This is
not even a contest. The closer I look at this, the worse the BEV
option looks</p>
<hr />
<p>"In general, lithium demand for BEVs is 8–15 kg Li for [typical]
50–100 kWh EV battery pack"</p>
