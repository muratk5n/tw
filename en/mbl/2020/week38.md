"@Dr_ThomasZ

Two of the next four candidate missions for @NASASolarSystem’s
Discovery Program are focused on Venus, as is Europe’s EnVision
mission, in which NASA is a partner. Venus also is a planetary
destination we can reach with smaller missions"

It's funny I was watching an interview with Peter Beck (RocketLab) he
was saying Venus loooks intreresting a week before the discovery I
made a note of it, than the news

So you can change $\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{3}$ into

Einstein advice on being useful is now more relevant than ever; bcz of

If I wanted to search for a word inside in all files under a directory
starting from `/blah`, I would not want a program that does exactly
that. I'd piece it together from other components. `find /blah -name
'*' -exec grep 'word' {} \;`. The components here are `find` and
`grep`. The Unix Way.

I've had cases with notebooks when keyboard repair was too bothersome,
whole comp had to be replaced. This way u cld simply replace the
external keyboard. Or simply replace the brain (RPi), for upgrades
etc. The Unix Way.

daily work can be replaced... 🤔 RPi, keyb, monitor, all seperate,
seperately replaceable.

When Saudi Arabia allowed movie theathers for the first time, BP was
the first movie they showed in cinemas. I wonder why...

---

That's not what *Black Panther* was about.. It was abt simply having a
black king on screen, about "representing". R, e, s, p, e, c and t.

Which is *sorta* fine... There are so many movies abt European kings,
queens, why not a black king? This issue bears a similarity to the
minority billionaire issue though.. The main problem isn't having more
representation among billionaires. The problem is the very presence of
billionaires. We need to come to a point where kings and queens aren't
even inspirational anymore, but seen as despicable. For everyone.

advanced society tolerate a monarch ?"

NASA: "High Altitude Venus Operational Concept

The upper atmosphere of Venus, with similar pressure, density,
gravity, and radiation protection to that of the surface of the earth,
is relatively benign at 50 km. A lighter-than-air vehicle could carry
either a host of instruments and probes, or a habitat and ascent
vehicle for a crew of two astronauts to explore Venus for up to a
month. Such a mission would require less time to complete than a
crewed Mars mission"

"Data scientists" learn about the vector dot product as a "distance
measure", bcz their vectors are usually "features" i.e. customer, with
age, height, etc values on it, and if already normalized they can get
$\cos\theta = v_1 \cdot v_2 $, no need to $\arccos$ even just use it
as a raw measure between -1 and +1.

But I bet half of them dont know dot product can be seen as
projection. Sad.

NYT: "Last summer, oil and gas-industry groups were lobbying to
overturn federal rules on leaks of natural gas, a major contributor to
climate change. Their message: The companies had emissions under
control.

In private, the lobbyists were saying something very different.

At a discussion convened last year by the Independent Petroleum
Association of America, a group that represents energy companies,
participants worried that producers were intentionally flaring, or
burning off, far too much natural gas, threatening the industry’s
image, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The New
York Times.

'We’re just flaring a tremendous amount of gas,' said Ron Ness,
president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, at the June 2019
gathering, held in Colorado Springs. 'This pesky natural gas,' he
said. 'The value of it is very minimal,' particularly to companies
drilling mainly for oil.

A well can produce both oil and natural gas, but oil commands far
higher prices. Flaring it is an inexpensive way of getting rid of the
gas"

Why stress retracing the steps of innovators? Students need to see how
research is like. You are trying get something out of the jaws of
mother nature and she doesn't wanna give'm to you. They need to see
how hard that is, to reach point B from point A.

It's not just about "logic" (popularized by some scifi). Logic is
about finding inconsistencies within existing elements, mostly it is
not helpful creating new information.
