# Week 28

"@stevemorris__

I feel like I’ve generally been healthily pessimistic about the
pandemic since the beginning and still the past week has really felt
like a sinking in of the idea that nothing is going to be normal for
3+ years?"

Just watched *The Outpost* (based on a true story). They made it sound
like USG built the outpost in an indefensible position by mistake. Cld
be intentional. The place was a like a honey pot, pulling Tali

Australian CSIRO had tech for a while now to "crack ammonia" basically
converting it on site to take hydrogen out. H2 fuel stations can take
ammonia, and serve H2 right there for their HFC car customers.

Ammonia! Good choice.

"The completed facility will produce 650 tons of green hydrogen daily,
enough to run around 20,000 hydrogen-fueled buses, Air Products
said. The fuel will be shipped as ammonia to end markets globally then
converted back to hydrogen. Ammonia production is expected to start in
2025"

Barkan: "[F]uture leftist presidential campaigns will need to reckon
with a traditional media apparatus that isn’t going anywhere. Noam
Chomsky is right—the dominant mass media organizations are
profit-driven colossi that, too often, safeguard the interests of the
rich and powerful. Capitalism is their article of faith. That doesn’t
mean, however, the left can’t have a strategy for confronting this
reality and mitigating hostile coverage"

Tired of "apps", "web sites", or even "platforms"; the next big thing
coming out of SV should be all decentralization focused, for apps, for
e-cash, for anything

---

"In recent decades, corporations have taken over the internet with
proprietary networks that provide access in exchange for the loss of
privacy and ownership. The result has been an extractive data economy
that primarily serves a handful of tech giants to the detriment of
competition and innovation — and which is ripe for an intervention.

What might it mean to reboot the internet and make it open again?
Advancements in the decentralized web such as the Internet Computer ..
can put control and ownership of networks back into the hands of the
public. ...

'Platform risk is this concept that, if you’re an entrepreneur or an
investor in startups, there is a huge existential risk that looms over
all software development, essentially, is that at some point if you’re
successful, the big guy that you’re dependent on will come and extract
rents,' remarked Dixon. 'And in some cases much worse.'

'Like in the case of Zynga,' he went on, 'Facebook just changed all
the rules. It just destroyed the economics. Twitter changed their API
that just literally killed off overnight a huge swath of startups,
like Twitter clients and things that depend on the API.'"

The Irish covid tracking app is baller. It simply trades a code over

BTW, I keep hearing words like "populists like Bolsonaro, Trump,
BJ". These are very different politicians. Bol is like an 80s Rayban
wearing Latin American dictator, still obsessed with chasing
Communists. Trump talked left, but essentially could not deliver all
of it, mixed up some other toxic stuff, it might likely crater his
party. BJ might deliver, but will Tories play along?

---

No, bitch. There is left, that's it. It is ideally delivered in a left
party, rightist most likely mix it with other things making the whole
thing combustible.

And here is the "Tory PM" [announcing](https://youtu.be/0qZ_FpIEhGY?t=1173)

Talked abt the "original sin"; starting with fall of the Berlin Wall,
left went right, right went insane, and now, in the final phase
"outsiders" are jumping in con parties, doing leftist work in there as
the need for such approaches never went away, that some label
"populist".

---

Generally I am for (at least) two big parties covering two sides of
the spectrum. It matters.. CDU in Germany failed to "act right" during
the refugee crisis now Nazis are on the rise. There was a vacuum and
they filled it.

My theory is lack of empire always helped Europe, Renaissance cld
never take place with "Holy" Roman Empire around. Later possible
empires failing helped. So EU should thank the Brits?

G. Friedman, "There were many reasons for the inability of the
Europeans to unite, but in the end it came down to a simple feature of
geography: the English Channel. First the Spanish, then the French,
and finally the Germans managed to dominate the European continent,
but none of them could cross the Channel. Because noone could defeat
Britain, conqueror after conqueror failed to hold Europe as a whole".

Absolutely. Imagine, a side fights, and *loses* a war, and the other
side allows them to keep their statues, flags, and even send the
occasional President to Washington. And keep on this policy until it
literally couldn't, which is probably now. Letting shit be, this is
America. It lets "Italians", "Polish", etc to say, call whatev the
frack they want to call themselves, albeit delusional, they can say
it, just like Confederate states live with their symbols as if they
won the war.

"You said US lets subcultures be, allows to be how they are, as a form
of light assimilation. Were Confedarate symbols part of that?"

Pretty diverse list of people

"Our cultural institutions are facing a moment of trial. Powerful
protests for racial and social justice are leading to overdue demands
for police reform, along with wider calls for greater equality and
inclusion across our society, not least in higher education,
journalism, philanthropy, and the arts. But this needed reckoning has
also intensified a new set of moral attitudes and political
commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and
toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity. As we
applaud the first development, we also raise our voices against the
second"

I like he focuses to fix one thing, not trying to do the grand
approach; gravity and Einstein's take on it was always odd, doesn't
fit everything else, so he is trying to fix that, using information,
entropy and "emergent gravity". Maxwell combined electricity and
magnetism. He wasn't trying to do a grand theory of everything, just a
theory of .. two things.

Verlinde: "[On the theory of everything] I think it's already
surprising that we've come come this far as humans to understand our
the universe around us, but it's partly to do with the fact that we
are very good at making things abstract in equations that we can
handle, but in doing so we ignore a lot of information. I think we're
smart but I don't think we're infinitely smart, so for me the idea
that we can have a theory of everything, that really explains
everything, is sort of hubris"

How much money can Anatolians generate from H2? Based on [H2 numbers](../../2022/02/base-energy-numbers.html),

Panels can produce 1000 W/$m^2$. 

The green area seen on the map is 100 km x 100 km

<img width="340" src="twimg/EcO9kb1X0AAzdEp.png"/>

1 kg H2 requires 50–55 kW⋅h

In Europe gasoline is 3.51 dollar/kg, let's say H2 is sold at 4
dollar/kg by mass producers. As a conservative estimate, I give 50%
efficiency to the entire process.

```python
eff = 0.50
area = 100*100 * 1e6
energy = 24 * 1000 * area * eff / 1e3 # kWh
h2mass = energy / 55.0
print (np.round(h2mass * 4 / 1e9), 'Billion USD / day')
```

```text
9.0 Billion USD / day
```

That green area can generate 9 billion dollars of revenue per day.

Area too big? Do a tenth of the area, increase efficiency a little,
you get 1 Bil USD / day, >300 Bil annually, more than a third of the
country's GDP. That's a lota dough

"[Iceland] had done what it needed to do. People had listened to the
scientists, trusted its leaders, tested widely. If you needed to
quarantine, the government would put you up in a hotel and you would
continue to receive your pay. The country responded in a rational and
robust way and did everything it could to ensure that schools remained
safely open. Iceland was still managing the pandemic, but it had thus
far been successful, and life was continuing mostly as normal"

Countries in and around Europe with lots of sunshine can do well in
this econ. Spain, Greece, Italy, Anatolia... Export energy as H2 to
the rest of the world.

"Currently, the European hydrogen economy has a turnover of €2
billion. The EC’s has set an ambitious goal of €140 billion by 2030 .
Besides the obvious geopolitical and technical advantages, some
140.000 jobs could be created along the way.

Although previously similar efforts have been made, strong support
from EU institutions in Brussels and several national governments make
a convincing case concerning the hydrogen strategy. Germany recently
unveiled a €9 billion plan to set up its hydrogen economy"
