With -32% GDP growth Trump is toast. His only chance is if people
"understand" the predicament (not in the model, never seen before
situation), and if that offsets growth as if it was zero percent, as
in none, then the situation becomes neck and neck due to
incumbency. Long shot. Net popularity at -9%.

*The Guardian*: "The sky was the muddy yellow of an old bruise at 7am
in San Francisco on Wednesday, and by eight it was a dull orange and
the darkness that felt like night was coming on. This morning was
perhaps the most unnatural-feeling and unnerving of my life, with
darkness rather than daytime rolling in. People around California
reported that the birds that would normally be singing were silent ...

What is happening now is astonishingly worse than the western fire
season ever has been before. There are catastrophic fires in Oregon
–burning down a small town and prompting the evacuation of much of the
small city of Medford. Near Oroville in northeastern California, a
fire expanded by a quarter million acres in 24 hours, so far as the
experts can tell. That is a new kind of fire and we are in a new kind
of era. ...

I have lived in San Francisco all my adult life, which has meant
living in relationship to the Pacific and its damp cool breath in the
form of our famous fog. Often in summertime the rising heat inland
sucks the cool air off the ocean in the form of fog ...

Here the ocean is a beloved ally, bringing us cool fresh clean air—and
most of our weather comes from over the Pacific – but we are not the
ocean’s ally: the world’s oceans have soaked up most of the heat
climate change has produced, with disastrous consequences"

The aircraft needs a runway, the top rotor blades aren't powered,

Gyrochoppa

"Unlike a helicopter, which uses an engine to power its spinning rotor
blades, a gyroplane's upper rotor blades aren't powered by an
engine. Instead, the engine powers a back propeller that pushes the
gyrocopter forward. As the aircraft moves, air passes naturally
through its rotor blades, creating lift. ... If a gyroplane's engine
failed, its blades would already be auto-rotating, so the aircraft
would gradually descend"

I maintain that whatever delusions they might have, on gold, the world

Republican Party. I shared this previously in a tweet;

Would this happen under a libertard? They are for any kind of
commerce, large or small, right? There you go, even a goldcuck could
fix some problems in US where corporatist sluts **create** them.

---

This is a contradiction in terms. If you want strong ideology 4 your
side, you should accept it on the other side as well.  Maybe Lyin Ted
is the wrong guy for that, who knows, his father killed JFK and his
wife is ugly, but on principle someone with strong convictions should
be acceptable.

"Excessive surveillance often backfires in this way. We saw it happen
after the surveillance surge in many countries following 9/11. As
terrible as it is, Islamic terrorism is, thankfully, a rare event in
Western societies. It is perpetrated by small numbers of extremists,
who often know one another from their families or neighborhoods. That
makes them hard to identify through Big Data methods, which are good
for identifying sweeping, structural patterns, not for accurately
finding needles in haystacks—especially when those needles live near
one another, can easily avoid digital tools, or merely speak a
language that’s not commonly understood by law enforcement.

And broad surveillance can engender a chilling effect among the whole
populace, making people less willing to express their political views
online. Worse, using Big Data for rare events leads to the problem of
false positives. When no clear identifying and strong signal is
exclusive to the real but anomalous terrorists, the system will pick
up lots of non-terrorists as suspicious, wasting the time of law
enforcement in the process. You can imagine that the FBI must have had
better things to do than visit random people who had purchased
pressure cookers and backpacks at the same time, but that’s what
happened after two brothers used those items—putting homemade
pressure-cooker bombs in backpacks—to attack the Boston Marathon in
2013"

John Boyega's criticism of how the Star Wars franchise treated
characters of color is obvious to those who watched the trilogy. He's
just saying it out loud"

Excellent episode. THis is what made Trek great, it wasnt abt the
technobabble really, more abt the hard-core, anthropology-fi, and
working of tech into serious social takes.

Scihub allows free access to academic papers. People also can't
understand why they should pay for papers they are not even sure they
will use, that are themselves usually result of publicly funded
reseearch. Hence existing system is largely being circumvented.

"@Gassensmith

99% of sci-hubs traffic is probably people at home that do not want to
deal with their organization's byzantine VPN technology and expired
security certificates to download the paper legally"

1934 Pogoms of Thrace (in so-called Turkey) after which many Jews left
due to harrassement. Interesting time period. I used to know someone
from Tekirdag (in Thrace) who had learned tailoring trade from Jews,
then during 40s became obscenely rich from it. Now Im thinking, maybe
all Jewish tailors were gone by then and he was the only game in town,
hence the demand. Tailor's lastname; TurkSoldier (u cant make this
up).

"@pwcdanica

It's wild to see anyone argue against banning no-knock search warrants
in the name of public safety when that's exactly what led to police
murdering Breonna Taylor. Murdering a civilian in her own home is the
opposite of public safety. You don't get to eff that up again. No
more"

"In a speech on Friday marking 150 years of the French Republic,
President Emmanuel Macron criticised those who seek French citizenship
without accepting France’s 'right to commit blasphemy'. To be French,
he said, is to defend the right to 'laugh, to criticise, to mock'"

It seems blacks would be more motivated to go out and vote, and vote
against the incumb, than whites would be for Trump.

"'Guys are tired,' the Oklahoma City guard Chris Paul said in an
interview. 'When I say tired, I don’t mean physically tired. We’re
tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. It’s emotional,
especially when you’re a Black man. We’re all hurt. Everybody expects
us to be okay because we get paid great money. We’re humans. We have
real feelings.' These players can’t just 'stick to sports.' Not when
their lives are on the line, when their communities are
disproportionately dying of COVID-19 and police violence, or bearing
the brunt of joblessness and evictions"

"The Milwaukee Bucks hadn’t planned on becoming activists. They
brought basketball to a halt in a messy but honest way, recognizing
the absurdity of playing sports in isolated luxury in the middle of a
pandemic, all for a chance at bringing an NBA championship trophy home
to a city 40 miles north of where Blake was shot as his children
watched"
