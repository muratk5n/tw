HEP is recommended by Gianotti, Giudice..? You know the goombah are
just looking for another New Jersey, that one-step away place to move
to and never to move from again.. They got no experimentation. They
gon sit on their ass and eat ziti all day long, that's what they want.

---

The same problem keeps showing up again and again. Flailing in a
random direction is confused with "courage", "experimentation", or
"being adventerous". You gotta choose in which direction to shoot,
being mindful of ammo. Some trials are more promising than others.

"While HEP [high energy physics, colliders] experiment is facing
difficult times because of fundamental physical, engineering and
economic limits, the problems of HEP theory are mostly
self-inflicted. The decision nearly 40 years ago by a large fraction
of the field to orient their research programs around bad ideas that
don’t work (SUSY extensions of the Standard Model and string theory
unification), then spend decades refusing to acknowledge failure is at
the core of the sad state of the subject these days ..

About the canniest and most influential HEP theorist around is Nima
Arkani-Hamed, and a few days ago I watched an interview of him by
Janna Levin. On the question of the justification for a new collider,
he’s careful to state that the justification is mainly the study of
the Higgs. He’s well aware that the failure of the 'naturalness'
arguments for weak-scale SUSY needs to be acknowledged and does so. He
also is well aware that any attempt to argue this failure away by
saying 'we just need a higher energy collider' won’t pass the laugh
test ...

The most disturbing aspect of the interview is that Levin devotes a
lot of time (and computer graphics) to getting Arkani-Hamed to explain
his 1998 ideas about 'large extra dimensions', repeatedly telling the
audience that he has been given a $3 million prize for them. ... 

At the time it was pretty strange that a $3 million dollar prize was
being given for ideas that weren’t working out. It’s truly bizarre
though that Levin would now want to make such failed ideas the
centerpiece of a presentation to the public, misleading people about
their status. ...

This is part of the overall weird situation of the failed ideas
(SUSY/strings) of 40 years ago: they still live on in a dominant
position when the subject is presented to the public"

If it was, it was misguided. EU is not on the opposite side of the
world, it is UK's next door neighbor with existing trade over a
trillion $ annually.

The CANZUK idea is more globalization-inspired than EU relation ever
could be.. No wonder it is sold as part of "global Britain". It is
ironic an anti-globalization movement flirting with
globalization. Maybe it's just abt ppl missing the days when Britain
was tearing shit up overseas. Good times. But those days are gone, right?

Why not experiment with new ideas like floating cities, instead of
reliving old ones? On international waters, anyone can create such
structures, and they would spur lots of innovation.

"Was Brexit abt being against globalization?"

"@scottdetrow

[On] Pennsylvania and fracking. There are a LOT of things us national
reporters are oversimplifying and dumbing down here. ...  Fracking –
more accurately the energy economy that has sprung up around it -- has
been a real boost to the state, particularly Western Pa. Pittsburgh
has become a Houstoneque energy hub.

It’s always been controversial and many Pennsylvanians have been
skeptical – particularly in the vote-rich eastern half of the
state. And as both Dem and GOP governors underregulated, voters wanted
more scrutiny. While money poured in some places, other communities were very
underwhelmed by the promises vs the reality. 

There have been environmental red flags from day 1.  ... this is not
longer the fast-booming energy economy it was a decade ago. Thousands
of wells have been drilled, and energy prices have dropped. Both have
led to a relative slowdown. Voters aren’t as obsessed as GOP thinks
they are"

"Ardica specializes in the production of Alane, a highly stable,
extremely lightweight hydrogen powder now used by a select set of
customers in industrial and military applications. The U.S. Army has
been working closely with Ardica for many years to test Alane’s
superior ability to power a wide range of mobile and vehicular
applications. By replacing traditional batteries, Alane greatly
reduces weight and extends operations while increasing the safety and
efficiency of the soldiers.

The U.S. Army chose Alane because it can be stored, shipped, stocked,
and accessed easily. Alane does not lose its energy potential over
time and is unaffected by temperature variations. It does not require
massive capital investment to develop new infrastructure, and can be
recycled and regenerated"

According to [EIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) ,
estimated world energy consumption was 157,481 Terrawatt Hours in 2013.

```python
consumed = (157481. / (365*2)) * 1e9 # Kwh
print ("%d mil. tons" % (consumed / 70.0 * 60.0 / 1e9))
```

```text
184 mil. tons
```

Storing today's energy consumption for half a day requires over ten
times the amount of available lithium in the world.

Unfortunately for its rabid following this route is dead. The tech has
no future. Hell, it didn't even have a present based on these numbers.

---

Exactly. And we should be ready for that. Plus that 10 KW number
itself will grow, for everyone.

Leaving that aside, even today's energy requirements are out of reach
for bats

energy consumption is based on everyone consuming in US standards"

People making movies don't necessarily understand what they are
making, in the analytical sense. Art connects at many levels, one of
them is emotion, which is below analytical mind. Then movie makers
connecting to that in the audience also go through their own
subconcious. George Lucas thought he was making a movie with
allegories to Nazi Germany, Vietnam, Nixon, but he ended up making a
movie about early Christians and Rome in *Star Wars*. TV show *Lost*
looked like an existential drama, pondering the afterlife, or abt
nothing at all with random people running around through a
confusion-made-cool wizardry, but the show is actually about our
hunter-gatherer experience, and ills of modernity.

Chris Hedges: "The Democrats and their liberal apologists adopt
tolerant positions on issues regarding race, religion, immigration,
women's rights and sexual identity and pretend this is politics. But
these issues are societal or ethical issues; they are important, but
they are not social or political issues. The seizure of control of the
economy by a class of global speculators and corporations has ruined
the lives of the very groups the democrats pretend to lift up. When
Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party for example destroyed the old
welfare system 70% of the recipients were children. Those on the right
of the political spectrum, and we must never forget that the positions
of the Democratic party would make it a far right party in Europe,
demonize those on the margins of society as scapegoats. The culture
wars mask the reality both parties are full partners in the
destruction of our democratic institutions, both parties have
reconfigured American society into a mafia state"

Bill David on ammonia.

"[04:24] Because in 1908 and 1910, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch managed
to produce ammonia.  And they used nitrogen from air, and they used
hydrogen from water 100 years ago to do that.  And nowadays, we have
170 million tons of ammonia produced each year.  And it's principally
used for fertilizers.  And the statistic is that about half of the
world would go hungry if we didn't have ammonia, if we didn't have
artificial fertilizers"

"[04:52] 40% of the nitrogen that sits in your bodies, that sits in my
body, has actually made its way through the Haber-Bosch process"

"[05:31] But I guess very few of you will know this next piece of
history.  Because this is 1943.  And this, to me, is an absolutely
magnificent story.  It's the middle of World War II.  The Belgians
have actually run out of diesel.  It's been appropriated for war
purposes.  And their bus fleet grinds to a halt.  This is in November, 1942.
In May, 1943, the bus fleet was up and running with a mixture
of ammonia and hydrogen, running the bus fleet tens of thousands of
kilometers accident-free in the middle of World War II"

"[07:03] [W]e've managed to take a combination of sodium and sodium
amide.  And that's actually basically cracking the ammonia,
decomposing that ammonia, as well as the best ruthenium catalysts"

"[7:30] In a reactor not much bigger than AA bat, we got 30 Watts power
out of it, enough to power a television"

"[13:46] But I want to say that there's actually
a bigger level, a bigger moonshot that we can aim at.
Because ammonia already provides food for half the planet.
When you combust ammonia, when you use ammonia
in a fuel cell, what comes out at the end is water.

So we've got food.

We've got water.

I've talked about energy.  And in fact, what ammonia can do is it can
contribute to a bigger issue, a bigger dream of contributing to the
food, water, energy nexus"

Some scifi energy stats

Stark Ark reactor outputs 3 gigawatts

Trek TNG Enterprise generates 12.75 billion gigawatts (from *True Q*)

Cool to be in the future! (Or even in today's fi).

According to *Einstein's Unfinished Revolution*, Smolin doesn't like
BM bcz "pilot wave theory fails to satisfy another of our principles:
Einstein’s principle of reciprocity. The pilot wave guides the

Not surprising, Italian fascists built the social security system of
the country.

There is no "left populism", or "right populism". A grab bag of issues
stolen from right and left held together by media trickery or
authoritarinism does not deserve its own lexicon. Most of the time it
is simply fascism-lite. That's it.

"In many West European countries, traditional right wing parties are
challenged by a ‘populist right wing’ discourse which also started to
argue for redistributive welfare policies"

It's about $2NH_3 + 3/2 O_2 \to 3 H_2 O + N_2$

not about $CH_4 += 2O_2 \to 2H_2 O + CO_2$,

nam sayin?
