"Saudi Arabia is constructing a futuristic city in the desert on the
Red Sea called Neom. The $500 billion city ... is being built from
scratch and will be home to a million people. And what energy product
will be used both to power this city and sell to the world? Not
oil. The Saudis are going big on something called green hydrogen — a
carbon-free fuel made from water by using renewably produced
electricity to split hydrogen molecules from oxygen molecules. ...

The Saudis aren’t alone in believing it’s the next big thing in the
energy future. While the fuel is barely on the radar in the United
States, around the world a green hydrogen rush is underway"

"Plastic Injection Molding vs 3D Printing ? Which is Better? ... 3D
printing has given engineers the power to create plastic designs at
their desks and bring them to life in a matter of hours. Injection
molding, on the other hand, is the go-to for quality and
value. ... The use of 3D printing in innovative and experimental
scenarios has been grabbing recent headlines, but the reality is that
the majority of today's plastic parts are manufactured using plastic
injection molding"

Sad picture.

TR is not surprising I guess, it is a near-apartheid state where
certain sections of the population are opressed, a permanent morass of
defunct ideologies with a phony national identity, and a leadership
history which never had much spark. The color on the map is well
deserved.

South Africa, well, an actual frickin apartheid, until recently. 

Brasil, Chile make sense. Both countries opressed the left, via coups,
hard or soft.

Mexico, drug lords. Largely US' fault.

"@gabriel_zucman

According to the latest available statistics, US multinationals book
53% of their non-US profit in the main tax havens.

The 2018 tax reform has had no detectable effect so far on profit
shifting.

A country-by-country minimum tax of 21% (as proposed by Biden) would
make a big difference, since it would remove the incentives to shift
profit to very low-tax places"

No

"Should the left make coalition with libertards?"

---

Instead of ultra-right freaks, these libertard guys are somewhat
preferable. If they can become less pro corporate sluts, more pro
small biz, then there might be hope for US right yet.

That of course also partly rests on the left acting left. As long as
Dems encroach on their shit, sit on their couch, watch their TV, eat
their cheetos, they'll never act like a sane party. Then Dems will
spend another quarter century wondering why the GOP is so intractable,
and does not allow them to be "bipartisan".

"@AlexGabuev

Today's deal announced by Putin, @presidentaz & @NikolPashinyan in
many ways addresses core Russian interests in the conflict, and is
perhaps the best outcome (at least in short term) Moscow could get out
of the situation. ...

Russia has put its 2000 peacekeepers in NK [Nagorno-Karabakh] -
something that Moscow wanted to do back in 1994, but was unable
to. There will be no Turkish armed peacekeepers, which is very
important for Moscow. ...  Presence of the [RU] peacekeepers (in
Moscow's view) is a guarantee that [AZB] will not be tempted to resume
the war and capture all of NK territory. The Kremlin is sure that
@presidentaz took note of what happened after shelling of [RU]
peacekeepers in 2008 in South Ossetia"

On the face of it, looks fine.. More friends for Israel is a good
thing (I do want them to exist, also plz try to kill less
Palestenians). But if ripping up an existing peace deal caused the
hostility in the first place, then is lining up bunch of allies behind
Israel an unnecessary fix?

Wld US also strategically prefer an ME Cold War? Or have everyone be
in a concillatory / neutral state to both itself, Israel and
eachother?

We cant just do the "out-of-the-ordinary" for the eff of it, or for
tactics. There needs to be some strategic sense to it all.

Third Wave tech is overwhelming Second Wave institutions. IMO to

CNBC: "An $11 trillion global hydrogen energy boom is coming. Here’s
what could trigger it... Storing fuel in salt caverns isn’t new, but
hydrogen’s growing role in decarbonization has revitalized interest in
the concept.

The Advanced Clean Energy Storage project in Utah aims to build the
world’s largest storage facility for 1,000 megawatts of clean power,
partly by putting hydrogen into underground salt caverns. The concept
is quickly gaining momentum in Europe.

Some 130 miles south of Salt Lake City, engineers are working on what
will become a giant cavity in the ground. It’s a geological formation
known as a salt dome, a column of salt surrounded by sedimentary
layers, and when it’s filled with hydrogen, it could become one of the
largest renewable energy reservoirs in the world"

Fossil energy companies can win in a renewable fuel economy (there
