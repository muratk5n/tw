<p>"Veterinary scientist hailed for Faroe Islands’ lack of Covid-19
deaths ...The success of the Faroese approach is said by local
politicians to be largely a result of the foresight of the veterinary
scientist Debes Christiansen ...</p>
<p>His laboratory, which was primarily geared to test salmon for viral
infection, was adapted and he purchased the extra ingredients required
to test humans ...</p>
<p>Christiansen told the Guardian that the switch to human testing had
not involved “too much hocus pocus” and that his veterinarian
laboratory had been able to source materials required for the tests
from a wider range of suppliers than hospitals ...</p>
<p>Tracking and tracing has been a very important part. It has been
possible to trace all the people who have been tested positive and who
they have been with. And they have been put in quarantine for two
weeks'"</p>

<p>"Raworth’s 2017 bestselling book, <em>Doughnut Economics</em> .. has graced
the bedside table of people ranging from the former Brexit secretary
David Davis to the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who described it
as a “breakthrough alternative to growth economics”.</p>
<p>The inner ring of her donut sets out the minimum we need to lead a
good life, derived from the UN’s sustainable development goals and
agreed by world leaders of every political stripe. It ranges from food
and clean water to a certain level of housing, sanitation, energy,
education, healthcare, gender equality, income and political
voice. Anyone not attaining such minimum standards is living in the
doughnut’s hole.</p>
<p>The outer ring of the doughnut, where the sprinkles go, represents the
ecological ceiling drawn up by earth-system scientists. It highlights
the boundaries across which human kind should not go to avoid damaging
the climate, soils, oceans, the ozone layer, freshwater and abundant
biodiversity.</p>
<p>Between the two rings is the good stuff: the dough, where everyone’s
needs and that of the planet are being met"</p>

<p>(Lessons from Italy, HBR article): "Recognize your cognitive
biases. In its early stages, the Covid-19 crisis in Italy looked
nothing like a crisis. The initial state-of-emergency declarations
were met by skepticism by both the public and many in policy circles —
even though several scientists had been warning of the potential for a
catastrophe for weeks. Indeed, in late February some notable Italian
politicians engaged in public handshaking in Milan to make the point
that the economy should not panic and stop because of the virus. (A
week later, one of these politicians was diagnosed with Covid-19.)"</p>

are like any other numerical calculation, they have certain

<p>I fit the differential eqn for the SIR model, if we use Italy numbers,
a rough estimate gives a 5.5. Different countries give different
results however. I get an 8 from China, if we believe their numbers.</p>

<p>[A poultry producer company] Lynca’s first focus was to install an
efficient and flexible refrigeration system that could handle its
primary duties (chilling and freezing of meat) reliably and
efficiently. To that end, EP designed an ammonia system with a
capacity of 792kW (225.2TR) capacity that allowed Lynca to almost
double its production within the limitations of its electrical
supply. With this system, it managed to replace some of the simplex
units; the rest were later replaced with an HFC multiplex system on a
cooling-as-a-service (CaaS) model.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Produced stocks of standard emergency equipment like masks and

  emphasis upon local rather than globalized production;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Designed an economic system in which production is focused in
  low-wage countries and exported to the rest of the world, via
  lengthy supply chains that involve as many as, for example, 43

<p>Yes NY data is not exactly straight line after "taking log". I could
explore "super-exponential" fit, as in $ e^{x^2}$ (holy shit!), but
for now, am looking at the data with two seperate exp regions. </p>
<hr />
<p>Analyzing data as exponential fit.. The formulas below are why we
"take the log" of the $y$ values,</p>
<p>$$
y = a e ^{b x}
$$</p>
<p>$$
\log(y) = \log(a eb x) 
$$</p>
<p>$$
= \log(a) + \log(eb x) = \log(a) + b x
$$</p>
<p>Now the slope of the curve is $b$, the param that defines a particular
exp growth.</p>
<p>Let's analyze some state data. How did NY do? Let's compare NY,
Washingon, and Ohio.</p>

<p>"The greatest scientific legacy that Albert Einstein left us is this:
that the speed of light, and the laws of physics, appear to be the
same for all observers in the Universe. Regardless of where you're
located, how fast or in which direction you're moving, or when you're
performing your measurements, everyone experiences the same
fundamental rules of nature. The symmetry that underlies this, Lorentz
invariance, is the one symmetry that must never be violated.</p>
<p>However, many ideas that go beyond the Standard Model and General
Relativity — such as string theory or most manifestations of quantum
gravity — could break this symmetry, with consequences for what we'd
observe about the Universe. A new study by the HAWC collaboration,
just published on March 30, 2020, just placed the tightest constraints
on Lorentz invariance violation ever ..</p>
<p>The Standard Model is exactly Lorentz invariant. General Relativity is
exactly Lorentz invariant. But many incarnations of quantum gravity
are only approximately Lorentz invariant. Either the symmetry that
mandates it is broken, or there's new physics that only appears at
high-energy scales that breaks it. ...</p>
<p>One particularly good test that we can perform is to look at photons —
quanta of light — as they travel throughout the Universe. If Lorentz
invariance is a perfect, exact symmetry, then all photons of all
energies should propagate through the Universe ... If Lorentz
invariance holds, there should be a continuous spectrum of these
photons coming from these pulsars, without a hard cutoff ...</p>
<p>But what HAWC saw, to a precision that's almost 100 times better than
any previous measurement, indicates no violation at all...</p>
<p>[T]hese photon-based constraints teach us that if a quantum gravity
candidate such as string theory introduces a type of Lorentz
invariance violation that predicts an astrophysical signature of
photon decay, as many do, they are now constrained or even ruled out
by this new set of observations. The laws of physics really are the
same everywhere and at all times, and any extension to the Standard
Model and General Relativity must reckon with these new, robust
restrictions"</p>
