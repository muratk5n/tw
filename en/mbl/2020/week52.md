Now perused a 1999 Fukuyama book where he dovetails on some Toffler
work, talks about unhandled 3W entropy damaging 2W structures.

Other than that (!) sounds optimistic overall.

"The lack of options marketed to consumers has created a missing
middle: the zone between mass market and niche market where
experimentation is supposed to proliferate and engender
variety. Worse, the consolidation of the country’s vast creative
sector into fewer, more powerful production and publishing companies
has come at the direct expense of the quality of their product. The
coronavirus isn’t the reason *Tenet* sucked, for example. It just
sucked because Christopher Nolan has too much power, and very few
other people in his industry have enough.

This homogenization of the arts is a refutation of the idea that
capitalism produces true competition. Instead, we are entering a peak
era of market monopolies, where a group of huge corporations, many of
which trade in personal data, also have a stranglehold grip around the
neck of every non-megastar artist in the country"

We’ll have a more in-depth analysis of this draft bill later, but we
want to be clear about our opposition from the start: this bill is bad
for Internet users, creators, and start-ups. The ones with the most to

Did not like *Tenet*. Tries to be cerebral but fails to entertain,

[This](.././2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.html#australia) is why Oz is

Migrant quickly assimilates in a gen, so bunch of ragged punks from

these tiggers are no different from any culture that came and went
before them. The fairy tales are escapism.

People who grow up in a place, from a very young age, get its culture
codes automagically by osmosis (embedded in the second-level emotional
brain), so they are citizens, no matter their ethnic, cultural
origin. Origin, assumed subculture, parental 'heritage' matters
little.

People might try to posture, "represent" around origin, perhaps as a
reaction to being called a certain label all their lives, but both
sides of that argument is wrong. 2 wrongs dont make 1 right.

Hidalgo's analysis teases out the presence of these networks through
'product palette complexity' in the data, which highly correlate with
GDP (higher than ed level). The better your network, more complex your
products, the higher your GDP.

Why does success story belong to host country for even late
immigrating scientists? Power of expertise networks. Working side by
side is an effective knowledge xfer channel, that's why inno likes
such pockets ... See [Hidalgo](../../2017/08/economic-complexity-hidalgo.html).
U go to expt network, u benefit from it, inno flows from it. Those
pockets, its country, get the credit.
