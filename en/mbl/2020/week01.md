With a single recharging station, you can refuel a fleet of 100 hydrogen-powered light trucks overnight.

Func becomes better differentiable this way, with sig instead of
max. Nowadays automatic differentiation packages can diff anything
including max, but still, a friendly, symbolic diff ready func is a
good thing.

---

Lit saz piecewise splines are implemented with `c0 + c1*max(0,u-a) +
c2*max(u-b) + ...`. U can get bunch of connected lines this way
wiggling any way you want.. a,b are knots.

So `max` is just a switch. I thinks I can smootha dat, `def s(u,b):
return (u-k)*1/(1+exp(-tau*(u-k)))`, little smooth func that flips
gentler instead of max, nam sayin'? Then `c0 + c1*s(x,a) +
c2*s(x-b) + ...`. Sheeee-iiit

Works really well. Even in parametrized form over `t`. But I cant find
uses of this anywhere.. I cant be the 1st jagoff who thought of this

(Yees I know it's sigmoid bitch, but it's not for neuratic neural
nets.. It's for optimization)

Most of this is in jest - Elba is great, so is Cavill. Big fan of both.

Haha.. that's right - there was a tussle between Samuel Jackson and

blacks they keep getting these foreign blacks?". For minorities the
situation wld be more pronounced of course, bcz (if) there's a certain
"black quota" in mainstream movies let's say and when u give that to a
Brit, the American black in Holywood loses

He also seems to be a "Tory Psycic", so I am guessing his predictions
will stop working once Tories are out of power.

---

Does he know Baba Vanga?

---

Psycic thinks he hears other mediums, or a Baba talking to him..

What you are hearing is the burrito you had for lunch coming out of
your ass. It is the sound of your own farting... "I am hearing voices
from beyond!". No - it's voices from below moth-f-ka, like, your
ass. fffff ff fffff f - "he is talking to me!". Yes he is telling u to

If we can get fast payments done, there are gazillion
possibilities. Payments for artists can become extremely
efficient. Say I am listening to a song, *War*, I can send a payment
to that name, to that song, direct. That name will be placeholder, all
$$ to that name is distributed to all stakeholders behind that
name. It could be Edwin Starr, the Tempations, James Brown, or Chris
Tucker and JChan for singing it that one time in a movie - I dont
care. People can argue among themselves in courts who needs to be part
of that distribution.

I am liking comments in code less and less. For a expr coder they get

---

Call ISIS the result of Sunni frustration or due to diabolical allies,
the result is the same. The whole shabang was the outcome of an
US-Iran raproachement. 

---

Bam approach was abt cajoling Iran for a nuclear deal. Old allies
however freaked out and "out of nowhere" ISIS terror started - this is
when Soleimani was "fighting ISIS"-. Now nuke deal is gone, old allies
are new again, Iran is under pressure. Soleimani was now back fighting
US before he was killed. ISIS of course has magically disappeared.

"Induction heating occurs when a high frequency alternating current is
passed through a coil. Because of this, the induced magnetic field in
the surroundings is swinging rapidly, stirring polar particles
(particles that have a distinct plus and minus pole even if they’re
electrically neutral overall) in the field. This can result even in
ripping molecules apart (dissociation) and knocking electrons out of
their orbitals (ionization). The charged remnants are ions and
electrons, forming a plasma. Because of this, the device is called an
“inductive plasma generator” or IPG...

Generating a plasma without contact, the propellant cannot damage
e.g. electrodes. This allows a near arbitrary selection of gasses as
propellant, and therefore viable in-situ resource utilization
concepts. Even space station wastes could be fed to such a thruster"

Apparently it's possible to excite propellant molecules magnetically
and push electrons out from a nozzle pushing a small rocket. By small
I mean small. Cubesats are tiny. And it only works in vacuum (in
space, getting to space from Earth not possib). Still - cool.

"@Aaron_M_DeVries

I ordered a small 12 volt induction heating coil. I'm going to make a
tiny low power induction thermal thruster along with the larger one.

Can see how it scales. Also a tiny thruster that can run off 2 9 volt
batteries opens up #cubesat possibility \#space \#science"

Good choice Riksbank Sweden. We are back to Defcon 3.

Stop funding that joke of a "Nobel Prize" we could even go down to
Defcon 1.

"Sweden Ends Its Experiment.

Negative rates are the destruction of money, an economic aberration
based on the mistakes of many central banks and some of their
economists who start from a wrong diagnosis: the idea that economic
agents do not take more credit or invest more because they choose to
save too much and therefore saving must be penalized to stimulate the
economy... it is a ludicrous idea.

Inflation and growth are not low due to excess savings, but because of
excess debt, perpetuating overcapacity with low rates and high
liquidity and zombifying the economy by subsidizing the low
productivity and highly indebted sectors ...

Sweden launched its failed negative rate plan almost five years ago
and now reverses it due to the financial risks that are created. The
most interesting thing is that it reverses the policy of negative
rates precisely because of the risk of an economic slowdown because
the evidence shows that investment and consumption decisions do not
increase with financial repression"

Not necessarily. Digital basic income could create some new
options. DBI holders could contribute $ to a pool for instance which
can act as a lender to businesses. That credit will fuel growth,
create more services and goods, more money chasing after more
services, so-so inflation.

"If the ppl get digital income, and money base expands 4% annually
wouldnt that create a lot of inflation?"

"The best verdict on Game of Thrones came from one of its guest stars,

about George R. R. Martin’s epic saga. It was, after all, “only tits

Hyundai Nexo HFC car emits drinkable water from its exhaust (instead
of carbon monoxide, isn't that cool?) so maybe that's the way to get
desalinated water. Seawater -> H2 -> HFC -> Water. Then u'd have to
use H2 for something but that's easy, that's why we'd have H2 fuel in
the first place. Heating, electricity generation, etc. will not only
do work, it will also create water.

U know what would be cool? Electrolysis on seawater (already some
successes there) and desalination at the same time.

"A Global Green New Deal

Right before Christmas, researchers from Stanford and Berkley,
published a 119-page report ..

The plan would require an investment of about $73T USD over the next
30 years, but the research shows that a payback period, adjusted for
new jobs and estimated savings from climate related disasters, could
be as little as 7 years...

The best thing about this plan, almost all of the technology needed to
make it happen already exists...

The net job creation from this plan would be 28.6M"

"A little-noticed 2018 methane leak at an Exxon Mobil site in Ohio was
one of the worst in recent memory, outpacing the methane emissions
from the entire oil and gas industries of many countries.

That's according to a paper published Dec. 16 .. When the natural gas
well in Belmont County, Ohio, blew in February, it was a significant
local event, prompting the evacuation of about 100 residents within a
1-mile (1.6 kilometers) radius, the Times reported. But it wasn't
clear how large the leak was until researchers in the new paper,
studying data from a new European Space Agency (ESA)
methane-monitoring satellite, spotted the plume."

I dont think everyone understands the significance of decelaration in
economic numbers. Deceleration means someone slammed on the
brakes. You might see increases on certain numbers afterwards, but
their increase rate is slowing. The car is still gaining distance but
it is gaining that distance less and less (until full stop). Because
decel is keyed to that slamming the brakes event it is a signifier of
things to come.

"Despite subsidies of about $10,000 per car, battery-powered electric
cars represent less than one-third of 1% of the world’s 1 billion
vehicles. The IEA estimates that with sustained political pressure and
subsidies, electric cars could account for 15% of the much larger
global fleet in 2040, but it notes that this increase in share will
reduce global CO2 emissions by just 1%.

We already spend $129 billion per year subsidizing solar and wind
energy, yet these sources meet just 1.1% of our global energy needs.

As IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol has said, 'If you think you can
save the climate with electric cars, you’re completely wrong.'"
