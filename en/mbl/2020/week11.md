Surely gov off'ls can be unreliable, morons too, but ppl *expect*
them to be reliable, above a certain baseline. That's why they are
imbued with all this emergency capab, tax dollars, etc.

---

One might think "but wouldnt info spread, like peer-to-peer dude, and
everyone would know and act?". Nope. Expertise, gov matters. A
Whatsapp group, the random tuber jumping up and down has a voice, but
is it a reliable voice?

---

People are so locally minded (and that's fine). There has been
constant intnl news abt cov19, there were cases all around Tiggerland
but nothing in Tiggerland. Clearly the inbred officials were hiding
it. No peep from people tho.. It wasnt until gov announced the 1st
case, then tigger started talking about it, see ppl at the markets
etc. It's important to realize this - people __rely__ on governance,
nationally. Especially at times of despair.

The "store front" of the prog left became "too diverse", too
non-American in terms of others' perception. There are some fine
people there, no doubt, most are culturally American, but the message
should not be "multi-racial" which communicates "diversity for the f-k
of it", it is "we don't give an eff what your ethnicity is". Have to
strike a balance. Too multi-racial can put off whites, too Latin might
put off blacks.

---

The left needs to drop its need for orgasm from people agreeing with
them (also the turn-off they get from disagreement). "Agreement" on
issues might not equate to electoral success. Watch hot button issues,
even create them, get elected. Then implement issues and be judged on
the success of them.

I do understand the urgency around this though since so much got
diluted over the years due to errant, rabid centrism.

---

Plus voter mobilization is key part of the process, as in energizing
them to go to the voting booth. Issue based atomic polls might not
capture this dynamic. 

---

This was the Dem primary after all. If such ordering of priorities do
not sit well with some progs, maybe they should start their own party.

---

Atomic issues did not matter much, M4A, soc security, previous
mistakes on war and piece.. What mattered was the one hot button grand
issue, personality, and previous experience. Trump beat Hillary,
indirectly Obama, trampled on everything Dems hold dear including
sensibilities on race, now they want revenge -> Obama's VP. Biden
positioned himself for that and is winning.

Another point here is IN came to the possession of bunch of paper to
write on. IMO this was key - in computer science the only difference
between two computing machines, finite-state automata, and the Turing
machine is an (infinite) tape. The latter is the basis of all
computing, more powerful, because it can write and
__remember__. Essentially modern computing, and perhaps human adv
thinking, is largely based on writing, we can achieve by [a
lot](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/research/pdf/grad.html) by writing,
going back to it, revising, extending.

So the plague at the time helped Newton become what he is. Plague was
raging outside he was studying. If this WuFlu gets worse maybe we'll
get some good scientists out of it?

Gleick, *Isaac Newton*: "[Then] came the epidemic.  Three men in
London succumbed in a single house; by January the plague, this
disease of population density, was spreading from parish to parish,
hundreds dying each week, then thousands. Before the outbreak ran its
course, in little more than a year, it killed one of every six
Londoners...

The colleges of Cambridge began shutting down.  Fellows and students
dispersed into the countryside.  Newton returned home. He built
bookshelves and made a small study for himself. He opened the nearly
blank thousand-page commonplace book [empty notebook] he had inherited
from his stepfather and named it his Waste Book. He began filling it
with reading notes. These mutated seamlessly into original research.
He set himself problems; considered them obsessively; calculated
answers, and asked new questions. He pushed past the frontier of
knowledge (though he did not know this). The plague year was his
transfiguration. Solitary and almost incommunicado, he became the
world’s paramount mathematician"

Deaths due to war, disease etc are directly proportional to the
density of a population. I wrote about it on 2011,
[here](../../2011/11/logistic-equation.html) and [here](../../2011/12/more-on-logistic-equation.html).

Logistic equation, the best predictor of population growth, works well
because it includes a death rate inversely proportional to the density
of a population. Density means more butting heads on resources, more
physical interaction that create conditions ripe for war and
disease.

Decrease interaction. The ideal soc for most is still dumb villagers
in their dumb villages worhipping to bones and stray cats, dogs, with
weirdo rituals. We need to get out, sparsely populate the Earth, even
the areas over and under the sea.

Dude. MOAB totally did not work. What is this thing made of?

The outside of the dome where MOAB hit got trashed. Realistic. I dig it.

MIT: "Decarbonization of the electric grid is also a major motivator
to use hydrogen for large-scale energy storage, with potential
benefits for transportation and other segments of the economy"

New PM in Malaysia replacing Mahathir. I like Mahathir (came back
again in his 90s) but if he is getting old, I understand... Also tired
of hearing abt his protege / nemesis Anwar, guy's name is constantly
floated but never makes it to PM. Less of that the better. This new
guy I'd never heard of. Good.

Climate skepticism is not a "conservative" position. Being a con has
nothing to do with views on climate. UK cons are pro-climate (we can
thank Thatcher for that). Climate, a secondary issue in terms of
potential agreement, was turned into a primary one to hide the fact
that US became a one-party state. Abortion, guns serve the same
purpose.

UK suffered from one-party-ism too, thanks to "Third Way Blair", but
their cons went berserk in different ways. Anyway, not going into that
anymore, as promised 😉

Yees bitch, fuel-cells are space tech

"Before moon landing NASA tested out a lot of tech un seperate Gemini
missions.

Gemini 3 (Gemini’s first manned mission) was the first time a space
capsule changed its orbit mid-flight. Gemini 4 featured the first
space-walk. Gemini 5, the first use of oxygen-hydrogen fuel cells,
etc"

Wuhan \#Coronavirus : ‘recovered’ patient dies as China continues

First, CCP infects the world with the potentially lab-developed Wuhan

"As one panelist, Mahmoud Hanafy, Senior Vice President at Siemens,
put it, “The Middle East is a blessed region for energy.”

All seemed to agree, and they weren’t thinking about oil and gas.

That the energy transition is good news for the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA), that renewables could become a new source of export
income, growing even as income from hydrocarbons declines, was an
important insight that emerged.

Indeed, pilot projects now being launched thousands of miles away in
the Pacific, and planning in Europe, could hold great significance for
MENA. They concern the so-called ‘green hydrogen’ produced from
renewable energy"

Long-distance shipping of hydrogen will not require wildly new,
untested tech. We already ship liquified natural gas (LNG) at minus
160 Celcius. Go down 90 more that gets you H2 storage.

Then of course there is ammonia, storage at room temparature converted
easily into H2.

If there are infinitely many stars, why isn't our night sky infinitely
bright? Longer form below:

Webb, *Where is Everybody*: "Suppose the stars are uniformly
distributed throughout space. A star’s brightness decreases as the
square of its distance from an observer, but the number of stars
increases as the square of the distance from the observer. These two
effects cancel, and each grid shown above contributes the same amount
of brightness. Since there is an infinite number of these grids, the
night sky should be infinitely bright. Even allowing for nearby stars
blocking the light from distant stars, the night sky should be
blindingly bright. Why not?"

Answer: "It turns out that the paradox is explained by one of the most
dramatic discoveries ever made by astronomers: the universe has a
finite age. Since the universe is only about 13.8 billion years old,
the part we can see is finite in size. For the night sky to be as
bright as the surface of the Sun, the observable universe would have
to be almost 1 million times bigger than it is"
