I trawl.. it's what I do. I trawl many places for pol analysis
ideas. The Bernie-Warr-Biden poll time series correlation idea partly
came from Dick Morris actually (he has a YT channel, now behind paywall
-bad for him-). He looked at the sum of Bernie-Biden poll counts, saw
the sum did not change much indicating shared votes base (one's loss
other's gain). Guy is a pro, thinking empirically - always looking for
that fulcrum point.

He doesn't know much stats obviously, the proper way to do what he did
is through correlation analysis. I do that, and voila, there is a
correlation btw Bernie/Warren, and Bernie/JB (yes bitch there is
partial overlap between Bernie/Warren, dipshit is still pouting and
saying 'not so' :( )

It does feel like yellow vest movement is not claimed by any
mainstream parties. Very strange. The article claims it is
due to the failure of the left in France.

Likely true - protests revolve around social state being rolled back -
well Macron used to be in the Socialist Party. Why did they take him
in the first place? Is the left too far gone to accept someone who
clearly was overtly pro-business ?

"2018 ...Macron made reforms to the national railway system .. [t]he
reforms ended railway workers’ entitlement to life employment and
special retirement benefits, leading the railway workers of the once
communist Confédération Générale du Travail to call a series of
rolling strikes spread out over three months. Macron refused to
surrender to the workers’ demands, and the strike was a total
failure. This defeat of a classic working-class tactic no doubt fed
the frustration that would produce the yellow vest movement...

The anger of those living in the French periphery is so deep, issues
from so many different layers of society... The left [has no answers]
for one of the workers and shopkeepers. A seething anger has finally
exploded, and the left is no longer its vehicle or interpreter. The
anger now floats freely, striking where and when it will"

TR approach, similar. I talked abt nat narrative claiming ppl are from
Central Asia (!). That past was constructed - after "Otto" lost
Balkans, ME, you kinda need your past to come from "somewhere
else". Then, when the new state needs secularism (read: not-Islam),
all of a sudden these mythical ancestors are following some
shamaninism, praying to cat and dogs, porcupine, hyena... whatever's
walking around basically. This is utilitarian
history (re)construction.

---

Whole lota utilitarianism. The past changes according to what is
needed today. That's why ordinary Russkies know "[the real version vs
the state](../../2014/10/alex.html) version" on any topic.

"Putin has made a series of statements that Poland started World War
II, and that the Hitler-Stalin pact was forced on Russia by British
and French deals with Germany. The substance of the statements is not
worth debating; the Hitler-Stalin pact was no ordinary alliance, but a
treaty by which Germany and the Soviet Union would together invade and
divide Poland, which they proceeded to do. The claim that Poland
started the war mirrors Hitler’s claim that Poland was invaded to
protect Germans from Polish brutality...

In making this charge, Putin is trying to cleanse Russia of
responsibility for the war. By claiming that Poland, in some way,
forced the Russians and Germans to invade Poland, he portrays Russia
as an unqualified victim. In doing so, he reaches out to far-right
forces in Europe who have argued that Hitler was forced into war. This
is politically important. The European right has risen, and a segment
of it wants to rewrite history. The Russians have toyed with
supporting a rising right wing for years, and this places Russia in
that position. Putin is claiming that it was not the totalitarians but
the liberal democracies that started World War II, and that therefore
the liberal democracies’ claim to moral superiority is false" --

Prototech AS. A Norwegian company. First time I am hearing of these
guys. They will install an ammonia fuel-cell on the ship. Good to know
this tech is (or will be soon) available. Will it do H2 conversion first?

"A maritime innovation project looking to install the world’s first
ammonia-powered fuel cell on a vessel has been awarded €10m funding
from the European Union.

The ShipFC project is being run by a consortium of 14 European
companies and institutions, co-ordinated by the Norwegian cluster
organisation NCE Maritime CleanTech, and has been awarded backing from
the EU’s Research and Innovation programme Horizon 2020 under its Fuel
Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU).

The project will see an offshore vessel, Viking Energy, which is owned
and operated by Eidesvik and on contract to energy major Equinor, have
a large 2MW ammonia fuel cell retrofitted, allowing it to sail solely
on the clean fuel for up to 3,000 hours annually. As such the project
will demonstrate that long-range zero-emission voyages with high power
on larger ships is possible.

The goal is also to ensure that a large fuel cell can deliver total
electric power to shipboards systems safely and effectively. This is
the first time an ammonia-powered fuel-cell will be installed on a
vessel.  A significant part of the project will be the scale up of a
100-kilowatt fuel cell to 2 megawatts. The fuel cell is tested on land
in a parallel project and development and construction will be
undertaken by Prototech"

I am almost glad he talked about how tough it will be, none of that
dreamy stuff with gloss. There is hard work ahead. 

"Germany's transition to a fossil-fuel free energy mix will be like
undergoing 'open-heart surgery' as the car, steel and renewable
industries will need to work hard to stay competitive, its economy
minister said on Tuesday...

'We have to keep fighting for our competitiveness,' Altmaier told an
annual energy summit of government and industry leaders hosted by
newspaper Handelsblatt. Germany's efforts to wean itself off nuclear
energy and coal could be an export model going forward, he said...

The national hydrogen strategy will take shape shortly and may be
presented within seven to eight weeks, he said, adding that this was
especially important for steelmakers whose enormous CO2 emissions
needed to come down in a cost-efficient way"

EU GND has some teeth.

Europeans were working up to something big.. Like in Netherlands (see
the excerpt), their SC ordered the country’s government to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, but then it expanded the state's
responsibility to emissions even beyond its borders:

"The limited partial responsibility of the Dutch State in relation to
the global climate problem does not relieve the State of the duty of
care it bears: The government had explicit duties to protect its
citizens’ human rights in the face of climate change".

What does that mean? That means any company even a few steps removed
from the their econ could be held liable for their emissions now, and
fall under reg scrutiny. EU GND follows the same spirit.

There is usually a Chinese Wall btw media manipulators / others in

combustible job, if a candidate is elected, they wont be involved with

The forager vs modern man / farmer analysis appears in a few sources,
but each enmeshed with other things, with some "unnecessary"
noise. Ian Morris buried the main message in a book abt the West and
the Rest, in an analysis on who is up who is down. Chris Ryan talks
about polygamy, monogamy at some length. Hariri gets into this
national narrative business which in terms of origin and priority is
essentially wrong.

So the British is obsessed about class, the American about sex, and
the Israeli about nationhood. Culture polluting analysis. When I
detect this, I remove that part of the message from the rest. It is
basically noise, culture talking, not the brain.

basically Boeing delivered that plane by cutting corners which that
later became the product's undoing.

How is a card game an example of flipped classroom? 

Flipped classroom should be about total absence of "teaching" unless
they are asked abt something - so in essence they would not be a
teacher, they would be some sort of guide. Curriculum makes lots of
material available, among which one package becomes official, cleared
by DoED. The guide is certified on that, can answer questions on
it. The "games" if there are any, can be described in the material but
not enforced.

"[Teacher] thought she had the day’s lesson clinched. Her general
chemistry class at Central New Mexico Community College was going to
play a card game as a way of illustrating reaction rate
principles. She’d taught this course many times before, using a
“flipped” classroom format, and this exercise was always well
received.

Except that day in fall 2014 it wasn’t. The students didn’t grasp the
rules; they didn’t understand how the card game was connected to
reaction rates; they weren’t in the mood to play games. Concentration
slipped. Several students left early. “I was like, ‘Wow, that worked
three times, but now it doesn’t work at all; how very interesting.’
Just because it works for one group doesn’t mean it’s going to work
for another,” [she] recalls.

For educators who teach using the flipped classroom model—in which
students watch lectures online before class and then engage in
practical activities during class time to help cement concepts- [her]
experience is familiar"

RSI is the Relative Strength Index - measures if an asset is
overbought or oversold. Index value greater than 70 is
overbought.

Calculated it on Visa, looks overbought.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web

def rsi(price, n=14):
    gain = (price-price.shift(1)).fillna(0)
    
    def rsiCalc(p):
        avgGain = p[p>0].sum()/n
        avgLoss = -p[p<0].sum()/n 
        rs = avgGain/avgLoss
        return 100 - 100/(1+rs)
    
    return gain.rolling(n).apply(rsiCalc,raw=True)


import pandas_datareader.data as web
import datetime
start_d=datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 1)
end_d=datetime.datetime(2020, 1, 20)
spy = web.DataReader("V", 'yahoo', start_d, end_d)['Adj Close']

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2,sharex=True)
spy.plot(ax=axs[0])
rsi( spy, 40 ).plot(ax=axs[1])
plt.savefig('visa.png')
```

Energy ISLANDS.

\#pipesNotWires

"Proposals for Europe’s offshore energy islands are gaining momentum,
with regulatory issues rather than technology now looking like the
largest barrier...

The group hopes to pair hydrogen production facilities with offshore
wind [replacing[ the need for transformer infrastructure, with the
energy transported to shore as hydrogen instead of electricity"

Energy shouldn’t come from below. It comes from above [as light and wind]"
