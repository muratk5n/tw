# Week 49

This stash is massive. I keep a zipped backup of the `.git` , so if HD

---

I still do not support nuclear bcz waste storage is problematic. Much,
much more problematic than carbon storage coming from fossil CCS.

Oh yeah.. that simulation worked great.

---

Fossil companies can generate renewable fuel + carbon capture at the
source. Once produced, ship this clean fuel, and all the way down the
pipeline, the whole process is green. No pollution. H2 cannot emit
carbon at that point bcz there is no carbon in it.

H2 pipeline transmits clean, FC car uses it, water comes from its
exhaust. I mean it's comically clean.

Fracking needs to be banned, for other reasons, not just bcz it's
fossil. The waste water seeping into the ground, waste of potable
water, flaring, etc. Same for wildlife refuge drilling.

In short, fossil business can be contained, while still generating
clean energy. The whole network needs to be updated for clean fuel,
diverse generation methods can provide energy to it. Preferable input
of course would be cleanest generation possible, e.g. solar, requiring
no CCS at the source.

---

Fighting climate change is not about "jobs". It requires choosing the
right tech. Fossil fuels were a tech. Now it will be about a different
kind of tech.

---

Vaccines are on the way, great. But the whole process has been
excrucitingly slow. Vaccine arrival shld have happened in a few
months. Was it bcz of massive privatization of drug development and
research?  Companies excel at capitalizing on research funded by
others but little slow on the uptake when they have to RD something
themselves?

"8/9/1664, New Amsterdam becomes New York..

Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant surrenders New Amsterdam, the capital
of New Netherland, to an English naval squadron under Colonel Richard
Nicolls. Stuyvesant had hoped to resist the English, but he was an
unpopular ruler, and his Dutch subjects refused to rally around
him. Following its capture, New Amsterdam?s name was changed to New
York, in honor of the Duke of York, who organized the mission"

Iran deserves more of the blame on the Yemeni situation than SA. 

"For at least a decade, there have been numerous Yemeni, Saudi, and
other countries’ assertions that Iran has been involved in supporting
northern Yemeni rebels seeking autonomy from the Sana’a
government. Iranian diplomatic and political support for this
rebellious group (known as the Houthis) is undeniable, but Iranian
military assistance for them has not always been easy to prove. This
situation appeared to change in 2011 when Iran's increased involvement
in Yemen occurred in response to both the chaotic situation there
during the final year of the Saleh regime and the danger that the Arab
Spring revolutions would leave Iran increasingly isolated. Evidence of
Iranian efforts to supply weapons to the Houthis now seems
overwhelming in contrast to uncertain reports prior to 2011"

I dont understand why some still keep harping about the Electoral
Collage system... The electoral votes per state are already in
proportion to the individual state population, so there is no danger
of, say, Wyoming (3 electoral votes) overwhelming a state like
Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes). Sure bcz of winner-takes-all nature
of the process on state basis, some discrepancy can occur between
popular vote and the electoral result, but that'll push the candidates
care more about individual states which IMO is a good thing. Also the
system makes democracy more indirect rather than direct and that again
is *awesome*. The system is great the way it is.

NYT: "One of the great successes of the Republican Party in recent
decades is the relentless propagation of a simple formula for economic
growth: tax cuts.

The formula doesn’t work, but that has not affected its popularity. In
part, that’s because people like tax cuts ... It was in the context of
this worldview that it became popular to argue that tax cuts would
drive prosperity. Rich people would invest, productivity would
increase, wages would rise.

In the real world, things are more complicated. Wages are influenced
by a tug of war between employers and workers, and employers have been
winning. One clear piece of evidence is the yawning divergence between
productivity growth and wage growth since roughly 1970. Productivity
has more than doubled; wages have lagged far behind.

The point is not that economists were completely wrong. Productivity
obviously plays a role in determining wages. McDonald’s cannot pay
workers more money than it collects from its customers. But economists
were partly and consequentially wrong. Power mattered, too"
