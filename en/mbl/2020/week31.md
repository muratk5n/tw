People are fickle, mostly stupid abt politics, they only care abt
themselves -- which is fine, representative democracy works just fine
this way.

So understand..? No. UK electorate could have 'understood' WWII
situation and vote for the guy who won it, but they
didn't. Churchill's ass was grass.

The decision to keep the incumbent is in very general terms, a combo
of 'how am I doing', 'do I like this guy', and 'did he stay too long'.

"Shouldn't people 'understand' that there was a pandemic which
effected econ and not care abt the GDP fall, still vote for Trump?"

That's more like it

"Right populism sounds like fascism"

---

Noone sits around and defines these nice little categories for people
to fall into; politicians (therefore the people) naturally gravitate
towards certain blocks bcz of certain optimality. A hard-ass parent,
tough, strict with their children, would this person be more "work
till you die" type of person in his economics, or otherwise? The
categories arise naturally. If the natural categories are not
followed, take that as a sign of fail, artificiality in the system.

Corporatism is one of its main tenets. As long as you are wearing a
rainbow shirt, have a few black friends, and fighting "sexism", "racism"
*especially* at a personal level where you are constantly naval gazing
for someone else's real or imagined past sins, it's okay to let
corporations buy America.

technologies could become one of the defining business stories in the
global effort to stop climate change.

Scarred by its painful experience in solar PV manufacturing, which was
developed in Europe at high cost only to later move to China, Europe
is not taking any chances with hydrogen.

In a bid to outcompete China and fulfil its ambition to become
climate-neutral, Europe has launched a massive green hydrogen push to
decarbonise industry and aviation and secure promising export
opportunities"

"Microsoft tests hydrogen fuel cells for backup power at
datacenters. In a worldwide first that could jumpstart a long-forecast
clean energy economy built around the most abundant element in the
universe, hydrogen fuel cells have powered a row of datacenter servers
for 48 consecutive hours, Microsoft announced Monday"

"The formulation that slavery was tolerated as a necessary evil at the

(overoptimistically) that it was on an inevitable path to extinction,
is a fairly standard one, and mostly an accurate way of putting the

require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial nonfree
Javascript code. I use LibreJS to prevent nonfree Javascript code from
running..

I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git) that
fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to me. Then I
look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy to see the text in
the HTML page directly. I usually try lynx first, then a graphical
browser if the page needs it"

Nice.. Github lists the computer languages used in your repo in percentage.
My tutorial repo has roughly,


TeX  71.0%
 
Python 12.2%
 
Java 11.1%
 
MATLAB 2.0%
 
Common Lisp 1.3%
 
JavaScript 0.3%


That's exactly right. TeX is high in the list, obviously, the whole
thing is written in LaTeX. Python is next up, the main language of all
computations. Java is from the sub-blog, the non-math, tech part. Some
my early AI posts are in Lisp, GH caught that. Very good.

The grid is inefficient as hell. De-electrification is needed.

\#disruptTheGrid

"I'm most interested in seeing how Bloom Energy can potentially solve
two problems at once with a new strategy. The company recently
announced a new solid oxide electrolyzer that it expects to have
available in 2021. In its simplest form, an electrolyzer simply uses
energy (usually electricity) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen
atoms. It's the reverse of the chemical reaction that takes place in a
fuel cell.

The reason electrolyzers are important for energy is that -- if
they're cost-effective -- they could essentially make fossil fuels
obsolete by creating clean, abundant fuel. Water is abundant, and
there's more than enough wind and solar energy to replace all fossil
fuels, so clean energy isn't a problem either. Bloom Energy plans to
use this fuel for its backup markets, but it could also be used in
large ships currently being developed by Samsung Heavy Industries and
Bloom Energy. This could disrupt shipping as well as the grid"

*The Atlantic*: "The U.S. and China both offer different social and
governance models—one is generally free and open and the other is
authoritarian and closed. Each threatens the other, not necessarily
because of the foreign-policy choices the leaders make, but because of
what the governments are at their core. Beijing believes that the
freedom of the press, the internet, social media, NGOs, economic
interdependence, and exchange programs all have the potential to
undermine their regime. They are not wrong. Indeed, many Americans saw
this as a positive side effect of engagement. Many Americans rightly
understand that China’s authoritarian model has negative externalities
that threaten U.S. interests and freedoms. Tools of repression
domestically find their way overseas. Beijing seeks to censor all
criticism of its regime by coercing other governments, companies, and
individuals. It sucks up data on foreign citizens. It employs
mercantilist techniques to pursue dominance of new technologies. China
is actively seeking to eviscerate liberal norms around human rights,
anti-corruption, and freedom of speech. The regime interferes in
democracies to advance its interests. Neither side can accommodate the
other without compromising the essence of its system"
