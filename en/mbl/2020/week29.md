It's crazy to compare WWII tech to today. They had everything, albeit

bazookas. Even the beginnings of a computer.

Simply trying risky stuff might not lead to opt results. Taking
moderate risk on obscure things could be a better road. Obscurity cld
have to do with many things.. Fashion is one of them.  Certain things
fall out of fashion, therefore taken out of the realm of possibilities
altogether. What leaders need to do then is not just showing "courage"
on stuff that are around, but finding ideas that might have been
obscured for whatever reason.

I spent 12 years in Congress. It’s not divided

think the rich don’t have enough money and everyone else has too

are naive or dishonest.

"By 2040, a hydrogen network of 23,000 km is foreseen, 75% of which
will consist of converted natural gas pipelines ...  [the network] can
be used for large-scale hydrogen transport over longer distances in an
energy efficient way, also taking into consideration hydrogen imports"

Germany had a long history with synthetic fuels...  So they extracted
this thing, a gasoline-like fuel from coal, denser in energy no doubt
and easily transportable.

I remember reading fuel shortage was a major reason of DE losing the
war. But I seem to recall they could not produce enough of it. This
article says otherwise. The facilities were bombed.

"The leaders of World War II, on both sides, knew that an army's
lifeblood was petroleum. Ironically, before the War, experts had
scoffed at Adolph Hitler's idea that he could conquer the world
largely because Germany had almost no indigenous supplies of
petroleum. Hitler, however, had begun assembling a large industrial
complex to manufacture synthetic petroleum from Germany's abundant
coal supplies.

When Allied bombing of the German synfuels plants began taking its
toll in late 1944 and early 1945, the entire Nazi war machine began
grinding to a halt. More than 92 percent of Germany's aviation
gasoline and half its total petroleum during World War II had come
from synthetic fuel plants. At its peak in early 1944, the German
synfuels effort produced more than 124,000 barrels per day from 25
plants. In February 1945, one month after Allied forces turned back
the Hitler's troops at the Battle of the Bulge, German production of
synthetic aviation gasoline amounted to just a thousand tons"

"ZeroAvia has made headlines in its native California and the UK by
test flying a six-seat Piper M350 converted to run on tanked gaseous
hydrogen feeding a fuel cell which drives an electric motor.

Miftakhov describes ZeroAvia as a powertrain company and is bullish
about the programme. Hydrogen fuel, he believes, can achieve not only
zero emissions but also be cost-competitive with kerosene for small
aircraft as soon as 2023, when he hopes to have his system in service
on a 10- to 20-seater; talks are underway with operators of aircraft
like the Beechcraft King Air, Cessna Caravan or Viking Air Twin Otter"

music critic can review a concert, the deeply reported feature
stories, the assessment of a new restaurant, the obituaries, the

They had con radio.. this is a good point, such radio is mostly
centralized, "federal" in nature, they talk abt con issues but in
overarching, generalized tones, pushing broad buttons.. So they don't
really give a shit about your local problems, and in many ways, are
toxic for politics, especially the local kind.

*The Atlantic*: "McMurray’s opponent, the incumbent [congressman]
Chris Collins, had recently been indicted on charges of insider
trading. The Buffalo News ... broke the story of the indictment, and
some TV stations picked up the News’s reporting. Readers and viewers
in areas that had strong local news presences .. learned of the
indictment and, armed with that information, voted accordingly. But
many in the sprawling district were not so equipped. 'I’d be going
door to door,' McMurray [says] 'or meeting with people at a diner or a
fair, for example, and in the most isolated areas, a lot of people had
no idea that their own congressman had been indicted.' He notes that
Orleans County, a rural area of the district classified as a news
desert, was “one of the toughest places.' People there, according to
McMurray, had “gossip, conservative radio, or social media.' They had
echo chambers. They did not, however, have news. And so, by a
razor-thin margin, Chris Collins — who would go on to plead guilty to
two felonies, be sentenced to prison, and resign from Congress — won
the election"

"@rodrikdani

A word about manufacturing, prompted by Biden’s 'buy American'
proposals. It is important to distinguish between production and
employment. 

Manufacturing production exerts outsized influence on a nation’s
innovative capacity and productivity. It is important to have sensible
industrial policies that promote it. And it’s possible to reinvigorate
manuf in the sense of preventing a decline in MVA/GDP.

Employment is another matter. Labor content of manufacturing has been
in decline for a very long time (flip side of rising productivity) and
I think it’s virtually impossible to reverse
employment-deindustrialization. No nation has managed to do it.

The future of jobs is in services: health, education, retail. That’s
where we need to focus, both to create productive jobs and to ensure
workers are provided with adequate say and job standards. Today’s
industrial policies have to target services if the objective is good
jobs.

We’d like to believe that promoting innovation and good jobs are one
and the same, and that a manufacturing oriented policy will kill both
birds with one stone. I’m afraid that is not the case. Good jobs will
require distinctly different policies that don’t look like
yesterday’s.

Having said all of this, on the whole I believe Biden’s proposals go
in the right direction"

Fighting through alliances; I guess somewhat better than straight up invasion.

"Another example can be found in the Philippines, where special
operations forces have been working steadily with Filipino forces
since 2001, enabling mutually beneficial counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency operations. The resulting partnership between the
United States and the Philippines proved so strong and valuable that
Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte recently reversed his decision to
break from a troop deployment agreement with the United States. The
continuation of this partnership seems even more important for the
United States in light of a recent bipartisan proposal calling for a
'Pacific Deterrence Initiative.'

The initiative seeks to deter China from direct conflict through the
overmatch strategy discussed in the National Security Strategy,
requiring willing partners across Southeast Asia to allow for basing
and logistics hubs for U.S. forces. To even begin preparing for the
large-scale combat operations envisioned by the conventional military,
the United States requires the partnerships enabled by its special
operations forces on a daily basis"
