we should start by protecting at least 30% of it by 2030"

That's not why. If you are really looking for something, you need to
look for an inherent trait that goes way back. What is a major diff
between man and woman historically?  Having to carry and care for a
child. That would be it; caring for offspring would drastically
reorient risk/reward calculus, safety of the child would be
paramount. If there is anything inherently better with women around
COVID crisis fighting, it has to be this.

If you are *really* looking for a reason to qualify this (true) leadership success.

I work through directories. Any new concept, small project becomes a
directory, all work is there. Every supporting material also goes into
dir. Once done, a tutorial is created out of the subject, PDF books
get archived or `pdftk`'d into PDF booklets also get archived. Then
the directory is deleted.

There is only one dir active at one time, and maybe one future project
dir. That's it.

The market will regulate itself bro.. Consumer will benefit.. like a
win-win yo. 

"Frontier's own chart, below, shows the company's estimate of the
profitability of its current fiber assets. Note that the company
itself estimates that by 2031 the revenues from fiber would exceed
costs and thus deliver increases in profit. Note also that for the
first five years, the company would lose money on fiber. Fiber has
high upfront costs (like a house), but it pays off handsomely over
time. The inability to capitalize on superior investment opportunities
because they take too long to mature is the very definition of
dysfunctional short-termism. ...

The revelations from Frontier's bankruptcy filings don't end
there. Equally important is how Frontier cultivated, maintained, and
abused its monopolies. ISPs like Frontier know exactly where they have
monopolies, and therefore know exactly who has no choice and therefore
is not worth spending money on.

Frontier's documents reveal that the company treats its status as the
monopoly provider of high-speed Internet access for 1.6 million
households as a uniquely identifiable asset. Frontier wants investors
to know that it can precisely demarcate its monopoly territories
because it wants to show investors where it can get money (to repay
its debt and get out of bankruptcy) by charging a captive audience
more and delivering less.

The fact that Frontier—and its competitors—treat monopolies as a
bankable asset would seem a sign that there should be some oversight"

"@CaFCP

There’s an ongoing joke in the California Fuel Cell Partnership
(CaFCP) office that whatever situation Keith Malone walks into, he’ll
eventually find a connection with somebody.

'Three degrees of Keith they call me,' Malone says as he chuckles down
the phone. And they’re not wrong. Malone is well known in the fuel
cell and hydrogen space for his work with the CaFCP – an
industry/government collaboration aimed at expanding the market for
fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) to help create a cleaner, more
energy-diverse future with zero emission vehicles.

'It started on my first day on the job with the partnership’s
communications team,' Malone tells H2 View as he continues his story.

'I went to a conference with my colleagues and I dropped by the booth
of one of our members and there was a friend of mine from high
school. We were surprised to see each other and what was more
surprising was the fact that this friend worked closely with the
CaFCP.'

'From then began this series of coincidences where I was seeing people
that I knew or had a fairly strong connection to. It kind of blew
people away, and the joke ‘three degrees of Keith’ was born.'

Goldcucks think with their precious gold, there is no centralized
printing. Wrong. The reason gold came into being as money was
precisely because it could be printed!  By the king! Gold became what
it is because it could be dug (printed) only someone with lots of
resources who could employ people at mines, to unearth this rare
looking metal that was hard to fake that made it a perfect currency --
for a while.

There is always printing. With no printing, there is deflation. But
now that we figured out printing other currencies and back it with
governments and/or trust networks, gold and similar items today become
side-shows, commodities but can never form the basis of a currency,
let alone a world currency.

---

I maintain that any digital currency continually needs to expand its
monetary base, ideally print the money into everyone's account, weekly
or monthly, as a form of digital basic income. It will generate little
inflation, reduce the incentive to store / stash etc. and devalue curr
shifting some wealth from rich to poor. The excess doesn't even need
to be inflationary, new, inventive ways of lending can be formed, the
excess can flow to businesses as credit, creates growth, more goods
chasing more money = little inflation.

"Gen 3 [ammonia generation] technology is based on the electroreduction
of N2 to ammonia by direct or mediated means. The H-B process is no
longer required; instead, the reaction is driven by electrochemical
reduction and the H source is water.

There are several modes of this process being actively researched:

eNRR in which an electrocatalyst enables direct electron and proton
addition to the N2 molecule; and indirect or mediated mechanisms in
which a redox mediator such as Li+ is first reduced and then, via a
series of reactions, ammonia is produced and the mediator is
regenerated"

Thought leaders should not think at cultural level of course. Cultural
thinking is for morons (and regular ppl who are morons on much of
politics which is a craft, a trade).

---

Politicians play this game a lot (part of what I call 'closing'). Do
not lose hope on democracy however; ppl vote on very general things,
and their well-being is one of them, if econ goes bad, they die, that
is reptilian. Fight or flight trumps culture.

---

Maybe Reps decided the outcome of COVID can be politically
damaging, so it was time to press some buttons to create cultural
divisions, to change the focus, shift blame. What better way to do
that then to rekindle some culture codes? If there is cultural
tug-of-war between prohibition and "freedom", you just reframe the
COVID situation around staying-at-home, working-not-working around
prohibition-freedom axis, and you got yourself a nice little bruhaha.

In terms of effectiveness the hierarchy in the brain goes 1) reptilian
brain 2) culture codes 3) intellect. You press a button at the second
level, intellect will be overtaken.

Rapaille, *The Culture Code*: "Life is tension.  Everything we
experience in life lies somewhere on an axis between two extremes.
One cannot truly know pleasure without knowing pain.  One cannot
legitimately feel joy without having felt sorrow.  The degree to which
we feel an experience depends on where that experience lies on the
axis (a little painful, overwhelmingly joyful, and so on)...

Similar tensions define cultures. Every culture is composed of an
endless number of archetypes and of the tensions between each
archetype and an opposing one.  For example, one of the primary
tensions in the American culture is the one between freedom and
prohibition. We consider freedom an inalienable right. We have fought
numerous wars to protect it, and our citizens are willing to die to
maintain it. At the same time, however, our culture is very strongly
inclined toward prohibition. We believe we shouldn’t drink too much,
play too much, or exhibit too much wealth.  While the axis itself
never changes, where a culture stands on a particular axis varies from
era to era.  At various times in our history, for example, our culture
has found itself in different places on the freedom–prohibition axis
(leaning heavily toward prohibition in the 1920s and far in the
opposite direction during the late 1960s and early 1970s), but the
opposing force was always evident (bootleggers in the 1920s, the
Silent Majority in the latter period). This tension is a constant in
our culture and it helps make our culture what it is"

---

Due to prohibition-freedom culture tug-of-war probably.

"@LaurentLessard

'The cubic model' for forecasting COVID-19 deaths has been in the
news lately.

Cubics (and polynomials in general) are a very bad choice of model for
this situation. Let's talk about why. 1/n

Cubics are functions that look like: f(x) = a + b x + c x² + d x³
'Fitting a cubic model' means choosing (a,b,c,d) so that f(x) is
approximately equal to the deaths on day x for the data you've
got. The hope is that this f could then be used to predict future
deaths.

A key property of cubics (and polynomials in general) is that they
grow really fast when x is large. Depending on whether d>0 or d<0 in
the expression for f(x), you will get f(x) going to plus or minus
infinity, respectively, as x gets larger.

This feature makes cubics an inappropriate model, because we expect
the number of deaths to eventually settle down to zero. Cubics can
NEVER do this. So no matter what cubic we use, its future predictions
will eventually be nonsensical. It's just a matter of when'"
