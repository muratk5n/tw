<p>This battery business will get ugly, everyone best head for the
exits..  Based on typical 10KW energy consumption per person, a day of
storage and with 60kg of lithium / 70kWh battery means demand will be
90 times greater than world lithium reserves. This road simply cannot
work. Batteries are the business of 1 percenters, like this <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1607170043110/united-tesla-company-widespread-condemnation-of-elon-musks-bolivia-coup-comments">cretin

Lithium is no problem for that guy, his father owned an emerald mine
in apartheid South Africa, so stealing national riches of a country is
in his blood. Others won't be able to stomach it, and trading one
rare, natural resource (oil) for another (litihum) will start looking
increasingly stupid as we dive deeper into the green revolution.</p>

<p>When directing becomes cuck, it basically stops being art. Then you
have no choice but create hierarchies. White women, black men, Asian,
white guy, it goes on.. If there is a fight scene, for example, who
beats who is decided by the hierarchy. Asian guy can be beaten by
black woman who can only be beaten by the white woman. Of course
everyone can beat the weird foreign guy, that's like the lowest point
in the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Yeah the old man didn't give a flying f--k about globalization, to put
it mildly. Technobabbling, style-over-substance centrists missed that
part too.</p>
<hr />
<p>I wrote about globalization, way back when, that it wasn't all that is
cracked up to be... It didnt fit the theory, so I left it out. Then I
noticed an overemphasis on it in the general media, so I hit it. I saw
a few squeak, I laughed at a couple, but that was pretty much it. The
feeling is largely like you are some jagoff mumbbling nonsense in a
corner...  It wasn't fashionable at all to write that stuff. I never
thought, in my wildest dreams, any anti globalization policies,
thoughts, anywhere coming to fruition within my lifetime.</p>

<p>The new anti-glob left-right combo (if fascism, very lite compared to
WWII standards) brought certain trolling with it... They make light of

21st century cannot give free healthcare to its people, after decades
of promises and grandstanding, shouldnt they be trolled? Or in UK,
through papers denying left, as "left" invading a country, right
diddling on EU then "asking" the people, having that blow in their
face, isn't something a trolling called for? Or in TR basically effin
up nearly everything? They made an ass of themselves, and they
deserved what followed later.</p>

<p>On one of those cruise ships which experienced the epidemic in an

<p>"Solutions" like this are based on half-assed reading of futurists
(Toffler). Newt used to babble this shit all the time; like, he'll sit
in front of a chatroom while in Congress, takes "input" from people,
while technobabbling about it "dynamic price discovery, Moore's law,
synergy between hardware and software blah blah". This is not helpful
tech. The singular Speaker of the House in front of a chatroom is a
non-change. If anything you have overloaded this person, with bunch of
unnecessary input which adds to the noise not signal. Chatroom is full
of trollers, they are jumping and down and screaming "his ears look

<p>Is not. This is key; when u apply tech, it needs to cause structural
change. New ed method <em>replaces</em> teachers. It doesn't, say, add an

mostly a dumbass, with questionable teaching ability and skill, with
students having to listen throughout a lecture that is delivered right

<p>Court packing/busting filibuster/adding states all make sense to
me. We were in cooperate/cooperate for decades, but we are obviously
in defect/defect now, so we need a punishment period and probably a
reconstituted Republican party to rebuild the efficient equilibrium"</p>

<p>Daily Poster: "If you get your news from the political press and
television ads, you might think the US supreme court is a forum that
only adjudicates disputes over the most hot-button religious and civil
rights issues. What you would not know is that while the court does
periodically rule on those important matters, it spends as much or
more of its time using business-related cases to help billionaires and
corporations rig the economy against ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>In light of that, Amy Coney Barrett’s US supreme court nomination must
be understood as the culmination of cynical tactics that Republicans
have perfected over the last two decades. The strategy is
straightforward: they nominate plutocrat-compliant judges knowing that
the corporate-owned media and political system will make sure
confirmation battles focus on partisan wrangling and high-profile
social issues – but not also on the economic issues that justices
often decide"</p>

<p>Invading Iraq, say for democracy, would undoubtedly goad Iran into
action (Iraq has majority Shite, same as Iran). And once beligerent
action starts, others would have a reason to step in. The endgame
still could be a whopping Iranian invasion.</p>
<p>TR? The odd thing is, after 2003 many nationalists in TR started to
get quesy... A bestselling 2004 novel <em>Metal Fırtına</em> (Metal Storm)
for instance depicts tiggers being invaded. But u r a NATO ally and a
democracy.. Why would u care? I remember thinking "what crawled up
your behind this time, f-nuts?". They are bothered some inane thing or
another all the time.. But then I realized if u think non-democracies
are in danger and you see yourself as one, then you would perceive a
threat, wouldn't you? All of a sudden there don't be a coup every 10
years, minorities might get representation. Alas post 2015 we saw a
decrease of democracy and a rise of nationalism. So maybe people who
saw a threat did act.</p>

<p>There are many tricks in self-guided education. A simple one, and it
works even for highest level of mathematics, is proving a theorem in a
book which already has the answer. Cover the answer, try to solve; if
successful, great. If not, look at the solution, but now we see it
with all kinds of questions in our head, we learn more from the
answer.</p>
<p>These tricks can be taught in a seperate class on their own.</p>
<hr />
<p>Maybe certifier can do more admin work in that sense, but in my
approach, ed will be mostly self-guided. "Not all kids can do
that". Maybe. But maybe not all kids are meant to sit down and stare
at writings all day long either. Wide-spread ed as its pursued today
pigeonholes people in so many ways.</p>
<p>"But in your ed system how would kids receive, and do homeworks? If
certifier will not be a teacher anymore?"</p>

<p>Wanting to come across as a first-rate power.. Anatolians want it so
bad. But I think these niggers confuse acting out end-goal with
actually being it. "If I act the end goal I'll be it". Have a white
house'y place, with briefings given other than that the exec. This is
some retarded dumb ass shit...  What happened to the process? US ended
up being what it is as a side-effect of many factors of its near past
and geo. It didnt <em>try</em> to be it, and even now, many are unhappy with
the state of empire. So how can a country hailing from the sidelines
of modernity simply acting out the end-product simply be that end
product?</p>

<p>Technobabbling centrism had a certain pull on Dems from another
direction.. Politics, as a job, is mainly knowledge work. It deals
with information, decision, having to adjust to an existing canon (the
law).. All that cld pull them towards financiers, Silicon Valley
honchos, etc. </p>
<p>Technical knowledge is good of course, we want technically aware
lawmakers, like LBJ was in his heyday (the Apollo Moon program was his
idea), but if this turns into a <em>class conciousness</em>, we have a big
problem. Low income ppl lose representation, and Dems lose power bcz
white collar, aflluent folk, forming a mere 20% + concentrated in big
cities, cannot be of help in deciding most elections.</p>
