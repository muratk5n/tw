in deals signed.. [President] Yoon hoped to see South Korean
companies' participation in projects such as the NEOM smart city
project in Saudi Arabia and further cooperation in the defence
industry and future energy such as hydrogen, his office said in a

unregistered securities and accuses them of violating Florida laws
protecting investors from fraud and deception. The suit was filed in
Florida because FTX has offices there. The company is based in the

Transportation Department and automakers after a series of electric
vehicle fires tied to Hurricane Ian.. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) raised
concerns.. 'This emerging threat has forced local fire departments to
divert resources away from hurricane recovery to control and contain
these dangerous fires,' Scott said. 'Car fires from electric vehicles
have proven to be extremely dangerous and last for a prolonged period,
taking in many cases up to six hours to burn out.'"

Davis: "Ukraine Got Its Miracle In Taking Kherson Without A Fight (But
Winter Is Coming).. By surrendering Kherson city without a fight and
blowing the bridges over the Dnipro, [RU General] Surovikin has
preserved 30,000 of his best-trained and experienced troops for use in
the coming offensive, sealed off the southern front from a risk of a
Ukrainian flanking action and will soon have a massive new force to
employ...

Once this force is ready to launch Putin’s winter offensive (likely in
late December/early January when the ground has sufficiently frozen),
it will likely be preceded by a massive new attack on the Ukrainian
energy infrastructure to plunge the country into darkness, cripple the
remainder of its electrified rail system, and significantly hamper the
government’s ability to supply its troops with basic needs"

Example, 490 polled say candidate A, 470 say candidate B, out of 1000
percentages say A is ahead 49% vs 47%. Compute conf

```python
def d(k,n): m=k/n; return m,1.96*np.sqrt(m*(1-m)/n)

n = 1000.; a=490; b=470
m,t = d(a,n)
print (np.round([m-t,m+t],2))
m,t = d(b,n)
print (np.round([m-t,m+t],2))
```

Intervals overlap. Can't be sure.

---

$X = X_1 + X_2 + .. + X_n $ approaches Normal due to CLT, standardize
w $Z = X - np / \sqrt{np(1-p)}$, create conf intervals.

---

Assume indiv poll results are distributed Bernoulli, then the sum via
CLT gives Gaussian approximation. Calculate conf interval from that,
for both candidates, if intervals overlap, the win ain't sure.

Staff, has made the case in internal meetings that the Ukrainians have
achieved about as much as they could reasonably expect on the
battlefield before winter sets in and so they should try to cement
their gains at the bargaining table"

strategy for aviation and other industries. Hydrogen fuel stock is

support for H2 development and adoption means that costs can come
down, making it possible to decarbonize transportation industries that
are not easily electrified at a rapid pace, like long-haul trucks,
trains, and planes"

Lerner, 1992, *The Big Bang Never Happened*: "Overwhelming mass of
scientific evidence still contradicts the Big Bang, as this book
endeavors to show. As of this writing.. [BB] remains in just as deep
trouble as ever, with even wider divergence from observation than when
the first edition of this book was completed in late 1990... In the
year and a half since this book was written, the evidence against the
Big Bang has grown stronger, and the COBE results, far from 'proving'
the theory, have not in any way resolved the problems raised by other
discoveries. The key problem.. is that there are objects in the
universe— huge conglomerations of galaxies—that are simply too big to
have formed in the time since the Big Bang, objects whose age is
greater than the age Big Bang cosmologists assign to the universe
itself"

Many dunk on 538 for their past failures but they are making raw data
available through simple URLs, that is great. The site is useful for
me. 

---

That average is the result of an in-house recipe; gives weight to
individual polls according to recency, trustworthiness of the polling
company (why include them if they are not trustworthy), their
bias.. I've seen such approaches in analytics codes, they aren't
usually robust, I wanted to rock'n roll so went for the raw source
instead. Following indiv raw polls for race can expose trends, it can
give an idea.. It worked fine.
