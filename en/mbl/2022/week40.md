# Week 40 

Newsweek Opinion: "[T]he United States' formal position on the [RU/UA]
conflict has changed markedly little. That overly simplified and
Manichaean position, in short, is one of Ukrainian maximalism: Putin
is evil, Volodymyr Zelensky is noble, and—here is the big logical
leap—the United States will thus support the Ukrainian effort to
retake every square inch of territory in the Donbas and Crimea from
its nuclear-armed adversary, seemingly no matter the cost to the
U.S. taxpayer...

At this stage in the war, virtually all of this pablum is asinine and
counterproductive to the actual U.S. national interest in these
contested areas. Our national interest in the Ukrainian theater is not
coterminous with Zelensky's absolutist stance; our interest is for
de-escalation, detente"

Heritage has little effect in defining culture. Behaviour is mostly
shaped by subconcious codes received through osmosis from the larger
society around, burned into psyche before teenage. The process is
automatic, does not need education, stories, or stupid shit being
mumbled in rote, in robes, or funky hats.

---

US bizarre distant heritage worship is likely part of a psyop.. If
your citizens think of themselves as near-peer to citizens in other
countries, such population would be more open to persuasion for
intervention in those other countries. It's easy to sell deep state
meddling in Italy, Poland, if you have bunch 2nd, 3rd generation fools
as citizens who still think they are intimately connected to people
there.

Let's not forget it was Nixon who ended the war in Vietnam, not JFK.

---

That's interesting take on guerilla wars.

Nixon: "[First Press Conf, 1969, answering the question 'do you
consider it possible to have a cease-fire in Vietnam so long as the
Vietcong still occupy Vietnamese territory?]'

I think that it is not helpful in discussing Vietnam to use such terms
as 'cease-fire' because cease-fire is a term of art that really has no
relevance, in my opinion, to a guerrilla war. When you are talking
about a conventional war, then a cease-fire agreed upon by two parties
means that the shooting stops. When you have a guerrilla war, in which
one side may not even be able to control many of those who are
responsible for the violence in the area, the cease-fire may be
meaningless"

Integrated Kinetic Energy

"Despite similar landfall locations, [hurricanes] Ian and Charley were
different in a couple of notable ways. First, Ian exhibited a much
larger wind field and radius of maximum winds. Consequently, Ian’s
maximum integrated kinetic energy (IKE) – a metric designed to convey
the destructive potential of a windstorm – was more than four times
that of Charley (46 terajoules - TJ to 10 TJ)... Second, Ian tracked
much more slowly across Florida after landfall compared to Charley,
amplifying the effects of wind and water"

H2 Fuel News: "Quantron has a hydrogen fuel cell truck with a massive
range of 930 miles...  The company unveiled several long-range
H2-powered vehicles at the IAA Transportation show.

Quantron has been working with Ballard Power Systems as a part of a
strategic partnership. Through it, the company has been able to
develop a hydrogen fuel cell truck that will be able to travel
considerable distances before needing to refuel.

This is a considerable achievement as it helps to further support the
viability of H2 as a fuel for the long-haul trucking industry,
particularly compared to the range available from battery electric
vehicles, which must also carry heavy batteries to stay powered and
that require notably longer recharging times...

The Quantron QHM FCEV (fuel cell electric vehicle) is equipped with an
FCmove-XD 120 kW fuel cell that is among Ballard’s latest
developments"

Rubin, Summers got burned 

"During the 1992 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Bill
Clinton had talked tough on China—at one point accusing George
H. W. Bush, then president, of cozying up to 'the butchers of
Beijing.' In his confirmation hearings Warren Christopher, Clinton’s
choice for secretary of state, served notice that he would take a
tough line with China. So, in a move that the Chinese later dubbed
'the Clinton coup,' China’s top diplomats developed warm relations
with two of Clinton’s top economic advisers, Robert Rubin and Larry
Summers, who were more sympathetic to China, and worked through them
to persuade Clinton to dial back his antagonism. The Chinese had used
the same tactic during the Bush and Obama administrations, and they
had largely succeeded" \#Kush

follow"
