power at datacenters.. A round of applause and shouts of joy from
engineers at Plug, who built the fuel cell system... The moment was
the latest milestone on Microsoft’s quest to find a zero-carbon

support continuous operations in the event of power outages and other
service disruptions.</p>

threshold on that.</p>

<p>Surely wage decrease sounds bad.. this is how the mechanism works
though - sadly.  That's the reason I advocate new money entering the

<hr />
<p>Certain MSM narrative is "if interest rates rise, spending decreases,
because people borrow to spend". That is not the primary driver of
price levels. The major transmission mechanism (though crude) is
through businesses borrowing and expanding less, so wages and spending
decrease, causing a decrease in prices.</p>

<p>Natgas emissions 400 g CO2 / kWh. After 95% capture (which can
actually go even higher for natgas) the result is 20 g CO2 / kwh which

<p>How to compare CO2 emissions from solar (yes there is some) vs fossil taking
into account the entire lifetime? <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00439.x">This paper</a>
puts that value at around 55 g / kwh thorughout the lifetime of a solar panel
(there is massive carbon emitted while producing the panel).</p>
<p>For coal that value is 1011 g CO2 / kWh. But once CCS is factored in,
assuming 95% is captured, lifetime emission of coal falls to 50 g /
kwh. Meaning, coal + CCS is cleaner than solar panels. </p>

<p>Hopefully the RU debacle strengthens parties not antagonistic toward

<hr />
<p>Davis: "[In Ukraine] Most Likely Scenario (Collapse of Western
Support).. Without remarkable levels of financial and military support
from Western countries, Russia might well have conquered far more
territory, and far faster, than it already has. Moscow might have even
forced an end-of-war settlement on Kyiv by now...</p>
<p>Most Western countries have a reflexive opposition to Russia. They
regard Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine with a combination of anger, fear,
and for some, hatred. All Western governments believe that Moscow’s
invasion was illegal and unjustified, and they want Putin to fail. But
each nation is also primarily concerned about its own national
security and interests. That self-interest balances their desire for
Russian failure. They do not want their support to cross a line and
draw them into conflict with Russia...</p>
<p>An additional and often overlooked factor is that some Western
governments view the threat of a conventional attack from Moscow to be
negligible. They have given minimal support – enough to be seen as
“doing something,” yet not enough to risk harming their own militaries
or their own economies, or to risk being dragged into the conflict
themselves...</p>
<p>Already the economies of the West are showing signs that a recession
is coming. In part as a result of massive sanctions levied on Russia,
gasoline prices have risen to historic highs, global food supplies
have risen to near crisis-levels (raising the price of nearly all
groceries), and inflation in the U.S. and UK remains at a four-decade
high. But the gas situation in Europe may prove to be the trigger for
a retrenchment of Western support to Ukraine..</p>
<p>The populations of Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and other Western
European nations, however, recognize there is effectively <em>no</em>
conventional threat to them from Moscow. Why, they will begin asking
with increasing stridency, should they sacrifice their own economic
security, struggle to put food on their tables, and scramble to heat
their homes during winter so that their governments can support
Ukraine in a war that is not necessary for European security?..</p>

<p>Actually according to analysis Russia did not structure its modern

being the S-series SAM tech.</p>

gigafactory at the firm’s existing Royston, UK site... Earlier in
2022, JM announced a new strategy for the purpose of being the “market
leader in performance components for fuel cells and electrolysers,”

<p>Take Germany. Their numerous <em>Mittelstand</em> the small-to-mid size
businesses represent the depth of that type of knowledge. There will
be one obscure guy producing some funky valve that noone in the world
produces. And guess what, he finds customers and can charge top dollar
(or euros). Further innovation builds on top of this diversity, if you
want to build a clean-fuel combustion engine, chances are you will
find the parts, the know-how associated with the subcomponents of that
engine.</p>
<p>Producing a piece, any piece of a "globalized supply chain" doesn't
necessarily get you there. Producing the cap of Coke bottles makes
country part of the supply chain but won't provide much deep
knowledge.</p>
<hr />
<p>As <a href="../../0119/2017/08/economic-complexity-hidalgo.html">Hidalgo</a> proved,
know-how is what makes economies tick and countries to advance (not
necessarily "education" which doesn't always translate into actionable
knowledge). Hidalgo measures this through the diversity of products a
country produces, which is a sign of the depth of a country's
actionable skillset.</p>

still have their know-how. They built up a lot of that over the years.</p>

<p>Davis: "It would take a country the size of Ukraine the better part of
a decade and a massive level of support from friendly nations to
recover from the devastation the Ukraine military has already
suffered. The idea that the UAF – or the armed forces of any nation on
earth – can recover from the level of destruction they’ve suffered to
date and rebuild the strength necessary to drive an invader out while
at the same time fighting an existential battle, is flatly
unrealistic.</p>
<p>Russia continues to take severe losses itself. Putin’s forces are not
immune to the consequences of losing trained and experienced
personnel, but as previously noted, Russia has millions more men from
which to draw new conscripts and hundreds of thousands of other active
troops that can be repurposed to ground combat. It is by no means
guaranteed that Russia would be able to achieve total victory over
Ukraine, but the fundamentals are present to give the idea some chance
of success. For Ukraine, however, there is minuscule chance of winning
and a higher probability of failure if they try to launch an
offensive.</p>
<p>An unemotional assessment of this war would lead to the conclusion
that the Ukrainian political leadership should seek the
best-negotiated settlement it could get now, while it still has
complete control of Kharkiv, Odesa, and most of Donetsk Oblast – and
before another significant city is turned to rubble and tens of
thousands more of its citizens killed or wounded"</p>

<p>H2 Central: "[T]he Wyoming Energy Authority has released a roadmap
that outlines the path to building a hydrogen economy in the state...
'Hydrogen’s role as a decarbonized energy carrier with unprecedented
transportation and consumption utility makes this a truly
transformational opportunity for the entire state.'</p>
<p>Hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks – including
coal, natural gas, wind and even nuclear power – bringing the
potential to help sustain the wide variety of Wyoming’s abundant
natural reserves. In addition, hydrogen’s flexible structure can be
converted and transported in various ways, allowing Wyoming to utilize
its existing infrastructure, including an extensive natural gas
transmission system.</p>
<p>Hydrogen can also be added to existing raw low-value energy sources to
significantly increase the resiliency of Wyoming’s value chain and
provide processing opportunities within the state"</p>

the importance of how green hydrogen will be transported cannot be
overstated...</p>

shipping hydrogen as ammonia or an LOHC may be more cost-effective, it

conceivable that they could invest Odessa even before Kharkiv was
completely captured. But whether simultaneously or sequentially, if
Russia moved on Odessa they would almost certainly employ the same
strategy they’ve used countless times already in this war, surround
the city, cut off its defenders, and then crush the city with
saturating firepower.</p>
<p>If Russia were to successfully take both Kharkiv and Odessa (after
having taken the Donbas before), then Russia would essentially be in
control of all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River. .. Once the
fighting gets to that point, however, Ukraine will have effectively
lost the war. The chances of it ever regaining any lost territories
would be virtually nil"</p>
