<p>15% of electricity, 3% of overall energy is from hydro. I guess that

<p>If made clean, NH3 from coal can be shipped to power plants that can
combust it for power.</p>
<hr />
<p>Can CCUS be added to this process easily?</p>
<p>Wiki: "Ammonia made from coal is a process mainly practised by
China. China produced about 32.6% of the global production in 2014"</p>
<hr />
<p>NH3 is key; it is an H2 carrier, can extract H2 out of it, pipe it to
homes, fuel cars..</p>
<p>Ammonia itself can be <a href="https://youtu.be/5ejL65tKsGM?t=107">combusted</a>
cleanly in turbines and generate power. Ammonia cld even be combusted
along with coal to reduce a plant's carbon footprint. Plus NH3 is
useful as fertilizer.</p>
<p>Carrier, fertilizer, fuel - no other base tech checks so many boxes.</p>

<p>Wired: "A series of papers described astonishing results from using
machine learning, the technique beloved by tech giants that underpins
[so-called AI]. Applying it to data such as a country’s gross domestic
product and unemployment rate was said to beat more conventional
statistical methods at predicting [an event] by almost 20 percentage
points...</p>
<p>'They were claiming near-perfect accuracy, but we found that in each
of these cases, there was an error in the machine-learning pipeline,'
says [researcher]. When [they] fixed those errors, in every instance
they found that modern AI offered virtually no advantage"</p>

<p>Between long covid and boomers retiring (earlier due to pandemic) we
could perhaps explain the missing worker numbers. How much of the wage
rises are due missing workers? Remaining ppl get more money, not a
signal for overheating (therefore inflationary), it is due to missing
ppl's money going to them, there is no significant increase.</p>
<hr />
<p>Brookings: Two studies of long Covid patients found that 23% and 28%,
respectively, were out of work due to long Covid at the time of the
study. That suggests there may have been about 1.1 million Americans
not working due to long Covid at any given time.</p>
<p>Additionally, some long Covid patients reduced hours rather than
taking time off: 46% according to a study in The Lancet. That is
another 2.1 million workers. If those workers reduced their hours by
only a quarter, that would increase the labor market impact to 1.6
million full-time equivalent workers. In other words, under reasonable
assumptions given the data available, long Covid could account for 15%
of the nation’s 10.6 million unfilled jobs.</p>

<p>Hydrogen was already used to remove sulphur during the refining
process, for fossil. That's why oil majors know a lot about our magic
molecule... Salt caves, hundreds of miles of <em>existing</em> H2 pipelines -
the know-how beind that was all due an existing need. Now they can put
that knowledge into use, for H2 as the primary energy carrier. </p>

<p>Ukraine is also trading its own soldiers' lives for time. They are
losing a lot of people that are hard to replace.</p>
<p>"It’s become a truism, in the sixth month of Russia’s wider war on
Ukraine, that Ukrainian forces trade space for time, staging a
fighting retreat from less important towns, especially in the east, in
order to bleed and stall Russian forces"</p>
<hr />
<p>Israel is the ultimate 'frontier country' for the outer alliance. That
is their function, and a role they liked to play recently. It is more
suitable for them compared to say "Turks" whose bizarre national
identity causes them think they are outsiders, but Israel at least
legitimately can claim, looking at its near past, that it was an
outsider, culturally different (European) and not liked by many of its
neighbors. Still it is better for them in the long run to play nice in
their own region. Can't keep playing Cowboys and Indians forever.</p>

<p>How did I process the data? File has towns in rows, dates in columns,
for a town on a particular date file has 'RU', or 'UA'; I replace
those with 1 and 0, then sum all the rows (which obviously adds only
1's) - the total gives a chronological progr of total towns under RU
control.</p>
<hr />
<p>Targeted gov intervention works better on the supply side,
incentivizing companies towards certain goals.. Incentivizing
consumers en masse has more backfire potential - too many student
cheap loans blows up tuition prices, easy credit for consumption,
mortgages can blow up prices on goods, homes. Tougher to control
effect on "the many". During 08 crisis gazillions were thrown at
corporations, yet no inflation (except in the stock market,
housing). Inflation did not show up bcz money did not reach people's
pockets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brian Williams: Did anyone [at the NSA] know or care that I Googled
the final score of the Rangers-Canadiens game last night because I was
traveling here?</p>
<p>Snowden: You might say, does anybody really care that I’m looking up
the score for the Rangers game? Well, a government or a hacker or some
other nefarious individual would say yes, they’re very interested in
that, because that tells a lot about you. First off, it tells you
probably speak English. It says you’re probably an American, you’re
interested in this sport. And they might know what your habits are.
Where were you in the world when you checked the score? Did you check
it when you travel, or did you check it when you’re just at home?</p>
<p>They’d be able to tell something called your pattern of life: when are
you doing these kind of activities? When do you wake up? When do you
go to sleep? What other phones are around you when you wake up and go
to sleep? Are you with someone who’s not your wife? Are you doing
something? Are you someplace you shouldn’t be? According to the
government—which is arbitrary, you know. Are you engaged in any kind
of activities that we disapprove of, even if they aren’t technically
illegal? And all these things can raise your level of scrutiny, even
if it seems entirely innocent to you, even if you have nothing to
hide, even if you are doing nothing wrong. These activities can be
misconstrued, misinterpreted, and used to harm you as an individual
even without the government having any intent to do you wrong. The
problem is that the capabilities themselves are unregulated,
uncontrolled, and dangerous.</p>
<p>Williams: All because I Googled “Rangers-Canadiens final score”?</p>
<p>Snowden: Exactly. </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Why does blanket surveilance matter? Even if it is for "inocous"
"harmless" data? I believe that issue was addressed through the
Snowden leaks. Let's recall that Brian Williams interview when he
asked something like 'why does it matter if they know I do harmless X
or Y?'. Remember how Snowden just rattled off bunch of things he could
do.. That should've scared the shit out of anyone. And that's just one
guy; imagine a team of capable people like him, planning for weeks.</p>
