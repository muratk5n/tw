Exports and imports are the primary factors on a country's currency,
unless save for money flows - it's all about the demand for a
country's currency, vs demand on others.

Let's look at TR import/export ratio compare it to its currency [here](../tr/2019/05/stats.html#impexp).

The relationship is pretty close. Since 2019 it breaks, after BJ
became UK PM? TR started doing UK's bidding in return they give cash?

The police is being blamed for not immediately turning on the super
soldier skillset and rush in as if acting in the movie
*Commando*. That type of violence is probably foreign to many of them
in that force.  The point is not to put them, any police, in that
situation, or having those situation be extremely rare. Sadly such
shootings aren't rare these days, due to lax gun laws. You can thank
to Bill Clinton and centrist gamma cuck Dems for that, their
triangulation finally brought the country to its ultimate
conclusion. 5G issues were meant to be the side-show, creating the
illusion of disagreement between parties while agreeing on everything
else (bipartisanship, unity), allowing corporations buy out
America. But side issues got worse, and now the unnecessarily funded
police is unnecessarily being accused of why they did not rush in as
if on the movie set of *Commando*.

The new *Doctor Strange*..  It was pretty average, weak story (also
based on shoddy science -multiverse-). WTF with the zombie stuff I
thought apparently the director had previous zombie cred. Raimi's
earlier work *Spiderman 2* was widely considered as the best comic
book movie adaption until that point, but I cant see that presence
here. He was likely straightjacketed by Marvel.

Hope to see Johnny Depp in future movies now that he cleared his
name.. Back in the day I used to watch *21st Jump Street*. I really
liked *Donny Brasco* BTW, read the book afterwards bcz of the
movie. Forget about it!

Do green fine. But then dont be confused when your gov is still
talking about refineries, oil price, crude, natgas.

---

Saw it again on the news "a renewable project in [blah] hoping to
'replace Russian gas'". I look for the wattage it says 100 megawatts
🤦‍♂️ Fossil sources can produce **six hundred times** of your yet
non-existing project with a single pipeline. Guy has no clue.

---

I said "know how to sell" but get the policy right first. 

---

If exclusively emphasized green production was the right play, after
all this investment and thought-energy going into them, this would be
their moment to shine. Where are they? All the talk is about Russian,
Qatari gas, Saudi Arabia and now coal (it's back!)  which people were
thinking was being phased out.

Shitlib Dems need to own this fuck up. The West Wing act failed you.
You weren't smart, just like the writers of that show, you were just
dumb as fuck as they were, you only tried made it look good.

---

Coal is making a comeback. Oil/gas is all people talk about.. Somebody
surely effed up big time.

---

The grid is an abomination.  Especially for long-distance power
transmission it makes no sense to use it. 

---

Policy can encourage clean fuel transmisson and discourage fossil at
all stages in the energy chain. The further fossil moves the more
taxes it can get levied on.

Produce natgas fine, ship as LNG but that can cost little more. LNG
arrives at port, if it isn't converted to H2 for the rest of the
transmission, costs more still. Natgas reaches individual homes for
heating, same.. Those taxes over time can gradually be raised, since
changes will build up, biz will see where things are going, and line
up their investments accordingly (for H2 conversion, CCUS).

---

Obviously "alternative media" followed MSM too. Notice how the said
"alternative" toe the line veeeery carefully, won't veer away from
established talking points. Basically what you get is MSM narrative
with a few spaz out sessions sprinkled in to make it look "relatable",
"down to earth". Thought leaders could emerge there and some have
promise but mostly it is dumb repeats and culture war.

---

MSM simply followed the "electrification" mantra without thinking much
about it, that's what they do, repeat what was handed down from Dem
gamma cucks.

---

During jury duty people (even if non-gov, dont know policy) spend a
huge amount of time on one case, they turn into a mini expert on that
subject for a brief amount of time. In this case collective opinion
(of semi-experts) will work. We saw on Johnny Depp's case, they heard
the evidence, made a good call.

"If regular people are clueless, have no expertise on larger issues,
why should they be given jury duty?"

---

Court cases, hearings are great. Let's have more of them. So much
stuff comes out, it's informative.

in the fiction that Ukraine still has a chance, the more Ukrainian
civilians will be killed, the more cities will be destroyed, and the
higher the probability that Russia seizes yet more territory before a
negotiated settlement can end the fighting – potentially including
Kyiv. You’d never know that, however, listening to high-ranking
current and former officials in the West"

---

A total transition to clean fuel based infra (generation through CCS,
or renewables where available) can reach Net Zero faster than waiting
for total renewable power generation to catch up hoping one day if all
power generation is clean, all will be clean. Earlier policy made a
huge mistake. First it bet on an inefficient transmision, storage,
end-use solution (electricity) and lived on hope for the generation
part to catch up and 'kill fossil'.

---

Fast is no joke. Standard electric tower can reliably transmit 2.2
GW. An H2 pipeline can transmit over 33 GW with near zero loss.

[[-]](2022/01/wirespipes.html#10calc)

---

Governments can easily mandate (after a transition period) that all
fossil fuel to be used only for H2 generation + CCUS. That guarantees
fast power transmission, plenty of options for storage. Infra becomes
emission-free by default. Put H2 in a car, it's an emission free
car. Use it in houses for heating, it's emission-free heating.

Elections are on the way, but Netanyahu voted against the bill, did a

law.. [the bill] served as a key test of the government’s prospects
for survival, creating a paradoxical situation where some of the
illegal settlements’ biggest opponents in the government voted for the
bill, while hardline parties that support the settlements voted
against the bill in order to weaken the government..

The failure to renew the bill on Monday highlighted the separate legal
systems in the occupied West Bank, where nearly 500,000 Israeli
settlers enjoy the benefits of Israeli citizenship and law while some
3 million Palestinians live under military rule that is now well into
its sixth decade.

The settlements, which are fortified, Jewish-only housing complexes,
are continuing to expand in the occupied West Bank as well as occupied
East Jerusalem. They are seen as a major obstacle to any potential

beat that price of fossil fuel,' Gross says. Heliogen has built a
“sunlight refinery”: a setup whereby thousands of mirrors.. reflect
beams of sunlight.. onto a single spot at the top of a tower, the size
of a basketball hoop. That concentration allows the collected sunlight
to reach temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees Celsius.. 

It then stores that thermal energy in tanks of gravel. 'Imagine a
thousand pizza stones in an oven where you close the door after you’ve
heated them up,' Gross says. 'Those are going to stay hot for a very
long time.' The energy can then be easily transported to less sunny
climes, wherever it’s needed. 'It allows us to run on cloudy days. It
allows us to run through any other kind of interruption. That’s what’s
crucial for the world because we all want to have uninterruptible
power.

They then convert that energy into green hydrogen via electrolysis,
which essentially splits the hydrogen from water (and an important
distinction from dirty hydrogen, which is traditionally produced from
methane). “When you burn hydrogen, it releases nothing,' Gross
says. 'It releases just water vapor to the atmosphere. That’s the
beauty of hydrogen.'"

H2 Central: "Engines equipped with H2-HPDI (High Pressure Direct
Injection) fuel systems run on hydrogen and offer a spectrum of
advantages over other technologies, making it possible to accelerate
H2 adoption as a component of sustainably operating heavy-duty
vehicles. Among the advantages of using H2-HPDI systems from Westport
Fuel Systems include its practicality for fleet managers that require
straightforward operations and maintenance in the transition toward
improved sustainability. Furthermore, engines equipped with these
systems can exceed the performance of current heavy-duty diesel
vehicles while simultaneously minimizing greenhouse gas emissions to
the point that they are nearly eliminated"

The increase in renewables is great, but we are still inching forward
megawatt by megawatt and 1 GW plant is considered a big deal. Still
tough to keep up with oil / natgas resources of eg US, Iran, Qatar or
Russia. Guy digs one hole in the ground and boom: 60 Gigawatts. Need
more? Another hole, boom. Another 60. Saudi Arabia's total energy
output is about 1 Terrawatt.

When dollar is strong, other countries have trouble securing the
dollars to buy the oil with, ergo oil demand (and global price)
decreases. Non-US demand would effect oil price more, there are more
people outside US.

The Balance: "When it comes to international trade for raw materials,
the dollar is the exchange mechanism... When the value of the dollar
drops, it costs more dollars to buy commodities. At the same time, it
costs a lesser amount of other currencies when the dollar is moving
lower"

Historically there was a reverse correlation between dollar and oil.
Strong dollar, weak oil, and vica versa. The relation broke recently
we'll see if it sticks. Is the petrodollar system broken already?

The coup culture is usually connected to a previous feudal culture;
Greece and Asia Minor suffered various coups because of their earlier
Roman / Byzantium / Ottoman past. Remember the Praetorian Guard? In
sum, if agrarian-taxer-plunderer parasitic-government culture becomes
entrenched, it creates the types of people in society who think anyone
with military power can and should take the reins by force. This is
the feudal way. Coups are, therefore, pre-modern creations experienced
in countries on the road towards modernity.

Quora: "Why there have been frequent military coups in Pakistan as
compared to it's neighbour India?..

The British always divided Hindus and Muslims by treating Muslims
preferentially by recruiting Muslims/Sikhs in army under the concept
of Martial races. Indian army had excessive percentage of Pujabi
Muslim Army units. The units were organised with people from single
regions or castes. They were led by British officers and this resulted
excessive allegiance by minority units like punjabi Muslims who
imitated British officers and this perceived superiority complex
exists even today in Pakistan society.  This was broken by India once
India became free and the rule of Martial races in recruitment was
buried. Chaudhries and sardars were thrown out of the window giving a
body blow to Feudals. Feudalism was weakened by land reforms.
Pakistan continued in the old ways.and new Feudals are the Army,
Sardars in NWFP, KPK, POK, Baluchstan, Bueraucrats, and now a small
bands of industrialists.

Janes Defense: "Reacting to pressure from NATO's former Warsaw Pact
members and Russia's brutal war tactics in Ukraine, the alliance is
ditching its thin, so-called tripwire line of defence along its
eastern flank for a military posture more redolent of decades past:
more troop deployments, more pre-positioned weapons and supplies
across the region, and a return to Cold War-like pre-designated areas
for particular allies to defend on short notice"

"A recent Bloomberg report called attention to the unwelcome but
predictable consequences of broad Russia sanctions: “But some Biden
administration officials are now privately expressing concern that
rather than dissuading the Kremlin as intended, the penalties are
instead exacerbating inflation, worsening food insecurity and
punishing ordinary Russians more than Putin or his allies.”.. These
harmful effects of broad sanctions should not come as a surprise to
anyone that has followed these issues closely, since this is what
almost always happens when a country’s entire economy is targeted for
punishment. The inability to change the behavior of a targeted
government is even less surprising, since it is extremely rare for
unfriendly authoritarian states to knuckle under in the face of
U.S.-led pressure campaigns"
