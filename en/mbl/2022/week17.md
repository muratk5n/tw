That beach in Thailand, the filming location of *The Beach* became so
famous, tourists flocked to the place and destroyed it. Gov closed it
to visits now it is coming back to life.

Otto was done-in by inter-wave conflict; second-wave industrial vs
first-wave agrarian. The newer wave always wins.

---

'Cob' as in 'corn on the cock'

---

Pre-modern agro implies certain lifestyle; staticity, unorthodox
relationships with the goat (let's define "what 'is' is" kind of
relationship) worshipping ancestors, and of course they were driven to
sacrifice the odd human here and there. These were feudal
cobsuckers. Then they would be run over by an empire like the Romans,
Otto (there is always a bigger cobsucker) and this pattern would
continue for centuries.

---

All agro societies had sacrifices, it comes with the territory,
or.. the material "superstructure" - see [Morris](../../2017/10/wtwrfn-foragers-farmers.html#eastwest).

BEVs are also an ineffective, retarded midway creations right? They
exist at the intersection of the wall plug and the auto
vehicle. Mostly cheered by white-collar office dwelling Dem limpdicks
whose view of the "outside" never goes beyond that wall plug, a
bastardized product was popularized which is the battery-electric
car. Electricity transmission is not efficient, refueling, sorry
'recharging', certainly isn't - but a certain crowd likes these
half-way, co-existing solution-looking non-solutions, and the world,
econ can pay a huge price for it.

Canceling the student debt this once is fine; before changing the system.
It will play well with the electorate. People are pretty stupid on
politics but they understand the difference between 'have money in pocket'
vs 'have no money in pocket'

---

Don't butt in the market mechanism, in a mishmash way; no more gov
backed loans for anything. Private schools can be mandated to accept a
certain percentage tuition-free (not through a grant, or scholarship),
those seats would essentially be completely outside the market
structure.  Clear-cut division. Bizarre interaction with the market
will backfire, or will sadly fall short (see Obamacare,
Fannie-Freddie, tuition crisis).

Bingo - Sallie Mae, founded in the 70s

Forbes: "Congress also created a new entity, Sallie Mae, with the
right to borrow at rock-bottom interest rates. Such a creature was
unprecedented: until then, only the United States government could
borrow so cheaply. In an eerie foreshadowing of the subprime mortgage
crisis, Sallie Mae flooded banks with cheap cash, purchasing student
loans directly or lending to banks using student loans as
collateral. The system gave banks the incentive—and the ability—to
make as many student loans as possible...

Everyone involved—from politicians to banks to universities—convinced
themselves they were heroes. It’s true that the convoluted system
enabled many young people of limited means to attend college. But at
the same time, student loan defaults soared. So did college tuition"

---

Er no, I dont think RR is the primary culprit here

CNBC: "Reagan cut higher education funding and student aid, and
college costs boomed as a result. "

---

If making it easier to 'afford' something blows up its price, where
else can we find such effects? College tuition prices are through the
roof; and voila - look at outstanding student debt (also at
stratospheric levels)

Making the case for nuclear with "we'll build smaller reactors" is not
a strong argument. What's the difference btw four small reactors
costing 250 mil each instead of one that costs 1 billion (w power
output equaling four plants)?  But a new type of reactor using
different fission material can fly. That would be a new argument.

---

Lookit; Asia Minor is 4th in the list of Th estimated abundance;
344,000 tons. 

---

"Thorium is three to five times more abundant than uranium in the
earth's crust..  produces less radiotoxicity than the U02 because it
produces fewer amounts of actinides, reducing the radiotoxicity of
long life nuclear waste. Th02 has higher corrosion resistance than
U02, besides being chemically stable due to their low water
solubility. The burning of Pu in a reactor based in thorium also
decreases the inventories of Pu from the current fuel cycles,
resulting in lower risks of material diversion for use in nuclear
weapons"

Wiki: "The discharged wastes are mostly fission products (nuclear
ashes) with shorter half-lives. This reduces the needed geologic
containment to 300 years rather than the tens of thousands of years
needed by a light-water reactor's spent nuclear fuel"

---

Wiki: "A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of nuclear fission
reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant and/or the fuel
is a molten salt mixture... 1960's Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
aimed to prove the concept of a nuclear power plant which implements a
thorium fuel cycle in a breeder reactor. Increased research into
Generation IV reactor designs began to renew interest in the
technology, with multiple nations having projects and, as of September
2021, China is on the verge of starting its TMSR-LF1 thorium MSR..

A further key characteristic of MSRs is operating temperatures of
around 700 °C (1,292 °F), significantly higher than traditional LWRs
at around 300 °C (572 °F).. economical hydrogen production."

---

Terrestrial Energy is a nuke energy play. But these guys do a
different kind of fission, "Generation IV molten salt fission
technology". Can use thorium instead of uranium. Th more abundant, has
better waste management features.

If we were to adjust for the water loss, pineapple is 87% water, 47.8 * (100/13.) = 367 mg.

True liberterians could actually affect some change here; they would
be for the abolition of F-F. If democracy worked they'd do their
thing, the left would do the outside-the-market help thing, overall
things would approach to some kind of working setup. Instead there is
a weird mush of market/non-market solutions, and the 'heated debates'
are on stupid culture war.

---

On the previously shared Eslake comment "Schemes that allow people to
pay more for housing than they otherwise would, will result in more
expensive housing". Then how can we help people to have housing?

Increasingly it looks like butting into market mechanism can
backfire. So best help in any area should aim to take entire swaths of
said area out of the market-based system. For health insurance,
single-payer is much better right (which takes nearly the totality of
health insurance out of private scheme) than trying to co-exist with
the market which fails to insure everyone (Obamacare).

For housing, gov can pay, employ, manage projects seperately, outside
the market structure to build, deliver housing. Slightly nudging one
rate here, fiddling with the market there can create unwanted
side-effects. In US we saw it happen; those orgs Eddie, Freddie,
Fannie, whatever, they've been there for decades, yet in US median
house price now reached nearly half a million dollars. Fannie, Freddie
being the bizarre in/out market creations they are, fueled the Great
Financial Crisis too and nearly caused the collapse of the system.

Instead, they’re eyeing more modest wins, and hoping for more dialogue
between the two leaders in the coming months. And, despite Johnson’s

Various paths from that Qandil mountain to TR; one from Iraq but they
cld easily enter through Iran, immediately cross the Iranian border,

The darker green areas are Kurdish regions of Iraq, recognized by
central gov, with three governates, associated with two seperate
Kurdish Regional Gov families (north vs south), KDP and PUK. PKK
nestled itself at the intersection of three of these actors, KDP, PUK,
Iran, and on top of the hightest mountain of Iraq (the red dot).
KDP/PUK fought before, while in alliance now, doesn't hurt to
stay right between them for max leverage.
