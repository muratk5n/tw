Hydroship will be able to produce renewable H2 by using wind and tidal
stream turbines to generate the electricity to power the

offloading (FPSO) is unnecessary, substantially reducing the overall
levelized cost of energy (LCOE) to generate cost competitive H2
fuel. The vessel will be constructed using off-the-shelf electrolyzers
and ready-made wind and tidal stream turbine"

'First commercial scale hydrogen-to-MCH' project.. Interesting.
Posted about MCH [here](../../2020/10/h2-lohc.html).

"PETRONAS Hydrogen.. and ENEOS Corporation.. have signed a Joint
Feasibility Study Agreement (JFSA) to advance the studies for a
commercial hydrogen production and conversion project in [Malaysia].

Under the JFSA, both parties will pursue detailed technical and
commercial feasibility studies for the production of low carbon
hydrogen from PETRONAS’ existing facilities, production of green
hydrogen from a new hydro-powered electrolyser facility, and hydrogen
conversion into methylcyclohexane (MCH). The agreement is part of the
long-term [MoU] signed last August for the development of a clean
hydrogen supply chain between Malaysia and Japan.

The facilities are projected to have a total hydrogen production and
conversion capacity of up to 50,000 tonnes per annum (50KTPA) by 2027
for export in MCH form to Japan, where the clean hydrogen will be
distributed to Japanese industries through ENEOS’ refineries. Once
onstream, the project could potentially be the first commercial scale
hydrogen-to-MCH undertaking in the world...

Through ENEOS, this hydrogen-to-MCH project has been selected as one
of the Green Innovation Fund project by the Japanese Government, a
testament to the project's viability and competitiveness which is a
critical aspect in the development of the nascent clean hydrogen
supply chain"

Forbes: "[March 2021] As Hydrogen’s Levelized Cost Projections Fall
Toyota Sends It Racing.. [H2] levelized cost, or the measure of
average net present cost of production as a fuel or heat source for a
generating plant over its lifetime, especially from renewable energy
via electrolysis of water, is likely to fall considerably over the
coming years..

Should the forecasts materialize, such 'low renewable hydrogen costs
could completely rewrite the energy map," says Martin Tengler, lead
hydrogen analyst at BNEF. 'It shows that in future, at least a third
of the world economy could be powered by clean energy for not a cent
more than it pays for fossil fuels.'..

Automakers and their partner fuel vendors in many quarters remain
suitably excited, and none more so than Toyota. The Japanese automaker
has consistently nailed its colors to the mast via its Mirai range. It
is now going one step further by testing the performance of a new
hydrogen [combustion] engine by installing it in a race car that will
compete in one of Japan's toughest motorsport events"

H2 View: "UK-based Levidian recently developed a device which uses
plasma technology to separate methane into its constituent atoms:
carbon, locked into high-quality graphene, and hydrogen, which can
either be used immediately or stored for future use. According to the
climate-tech company, their model means they can offer turquoise
hydrogen at little to no cost, as there is a thriving market for the
by-product produced during the process – high-quality graphene"

Am fine personally with individual, even positive rights. Just saying
countries can be on a different path, schedule. If a new non-military
org was to be founded for democracies, I'd argue it should only offer
carrot, no stick.

---

Liberalism is about the individual, who can think freely, but that can
lead to conflicts, so you need a state to protect rights. Therefore,
one can continue, if everyone has such inalienable rights, they do so
all over the world too, a liberal state can try to expand lib abroad
(wanting to become that intl watcher that protects right for others
too) -- through coercion, or sometimes by force, which can entice 'the
other side' to the same.

---

'Not understanding' states like Russia cld be due to liberalism's
mental block..  See [Meirsheimer](../../2022/03/liberal-dreams-intl-realities.html).

---

What was the deal w NATO chief Stoltenberg "Central Bank appointment
announcement" right in the beginning of the conflict? Is he being
'demoted upwards'? He was talking tough game early on, then NATO got
cucked.

---

NATO was sadly a disadvantage in this conflict. Motto "one for all,
all for one" works *if you are in it*. If outside, the deterrent
aspect becomes a disadvantage. They are built to kick some serious
ass, which means going all in, with everyone on board, which you
cannot do even partially in a situation such as in UKR. So they were
reduced to watching the whole conf from the sidelines. Putin finds
those blind spots, and exploits them well.

---

My assumption was since 2014 UKR had been loading for bear (no pun
intended), had all aspects of a possible war covered, with NATO's
help. Then found out abt the air/sea shortcomings, it became clear
this cld turn into another Aleppo, Grozny.

Failure of monarchs (first wave concept) being in disagreement with
the modern states (second wave concept) is actually normal. Feudal,
1st wave ruling is about land expansion, posh elites who do whatever
in their palaces (thanks beating on peasants, taking their
money). Second wave structures are different, waves cannot mix like
oil and water. The incompatbility could cause major suffering, as in
the alleged fueling of WWI.

---

WWI being caused by a family feud.. Sometimes real answers are avoided
bcz mainstream (history/politics) wants to hide something or mired in
self-delusion. While studying finance I'd read journos; columnists
would regularly throw up their hands and go "well, it's a mystery,
year after year, stimulus after stimulus, there is still no
inflation". The obvious was avoided -- the money was going to
corporations, not to people.

Same with WWI, the bigger reason is "unknown". The assasination of
Franz Ferdinand is the obvious 'trigger', but the plethora of equally
viable (and contradicting) theories fail to reach a conclusion. People
throw up their hands and say "still a big mystery to us". 🤨 Is the
consensus trying to avoid certain conslusions?

---

Yes you could say Ukraine 'ate the quince'

Q is somewhat tougher to chew on too, maybe that's another why is used

This could be where the tigger idiom *ayvayı yedi* comes from, 'he ate

Included within the project is the development of a hydrogen storage
facility in the Piedras Pintas Salt Dome. From this facility,
pipelines will deliver the green hydrogen to Corpus Christi and
Brownsville where it will be turned into green ammonia, sustainable
aviation fuel and other fuels... This also opens up opportunities to
potentially be directly transported to hydrogen power plants and other

H2 Fuel News: "Israel to roll out new hydrogen powered trucks.. The
introduction of the vehicles is the result of a new deal among

---

The road towards the conflict was full of images of EU getting cucked
on energy.  "We'll cut your pipeline (NS2)", "we'll find you natgas if
things go awry (from Qatar, while tying them into NATO in the
process)". We'll take care of you boy.. Don't you worry.. Are you
happy now, feel taken care of, BOY?

---

I repeat the scenario. This whole ordeal can still be an answer to a
long-running ploy to cut off EU/RU energy relation, to stop the
formation of an Eurasian Superpowah.. RU gets tired of the little
blocks, delays here and there, throws down the gauntlet. 'We either
form a good relationship, or there is trouble'

---

And I wonder why...

UK.gov: "Unlike other countries in Europe, the UK is in no way
dependent on Russian gas supply... There are no gas pipelines directly
linking the UK with Russia and imports from Russia made up less than
4% of total UK gas supply in 2021"

---

UK sounds more enthusiastic on banning RU energy

---

I'm glad Germany denied the ban.

I really wanted to see RU part of this whole H2/NH3 transition..
Hopefully latest events are not a show-stopper in the long-term.

All those relations could not stop (allegedly fueled) a World War, one
would assume relatives holding high positions in each country could
act as natural ambassadors to eachother's countries, but no. They failed
and now mostly disappeared.

---

They are all related, like inbred probably, everybody's somebody
else's mother, half-brother, father, cousin, they they all have weird
relations, maybe including the royal goat (royalty is a product of
agrarian era, you never know what goes on in there, at those
palaces. It's f--ked up).

---

I first heard this angle in a 2021 movie in all places, *The King's
Man*, was pretty well done historically.

End of WWI saw the fall of two of those monarchs, and others too in
Europe. Maybe they got what they deserved, paid the price for their
uselessness.

---

"Was WWI caused by a family feud?

Far from being remote rulers who knew nothing of their enemies, the
heads of state of Britain, Germany and Russia – George V, Kaiser
Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II – were first cousins who knew one
another very well.

A BBC documentary screened in 2018, *Royal Cousins at War*, told the
story of Wilhelm's difficult relationship with his parents and
antipathy towards all things British and argues that this helped bring
the world to the brink of war.

The three monarchs were like 'sleepwalkers stepping towards an open
lift shaft', Richard Davenport-Hines says in his review of Miranda
Carter's book on the subject, *The Three Emperors*. The events leading
up to the conflict are 'a study in the envy, insincerity, festering
rancour and muddle that only families can manage'.

Unlike many family feuds, however, disagreements between the royal
cousins exacted a geopolitical price. 'As relationships between the
royal cousins waxed and waned, so did the relationships between their
countries,' the Daily Mail's Ruth Styles says"

natural gas *both* generate H2, and cars and heating *both* use H2,
then supply problems with either NG, or crude will be less
important. Not to mention solar, hydro which can be used to generate
clean fuel as well, adding to the supply, increasing the overall
resillience of the energy system. H2/NH3 will be the "molecular lingua
franca" of energy transmission, allowing all kinds of raw energy
source to be used by varied types of consumption.

Asia has huge landmass compared to Europe.. US/Canada are far from the
West direction, but if RU becomes Asia/Pacific oriented, both sides
can go on bickering over there.. Could be good for my native hood;
Just get the f--k out, do your shit elsewhere

Extreme case for RU, if UKR is "pacified", it will be a true buffer
with the West, and RU will "decouple", the mega-sanctions will ensure
that, Russia lean towards Asia.

Need that IRN gas output in case RU becomes unavailable, or at least

"Now [some are] talking about a situation where you defeat the
Russians in Ukraine. This is a much worse outcome for the Russians
than what happened in April 2008, and a much worse outcome .. [than]
in February 2014...  [The R]ussians are not going to roll over and
play dead,.. they're going to crush the Ukrainians, they're going to
bring out the big guns, .. to turn places like [Kyiv] and other cities
in Ukraine into rubble. They're going to do Fallujas, they're going to
do Mosuls, they're going to do Groznies.

[Remember] what happened in [WWII] when the United States was faced
with the possibility of having to invade the Japanese home islands in
early 1945. The idea of invading the Japanese home islands after what
happened at Iwo Jima and then later what happened in Okinawa really
spooked us, so.. we decided to burn Japanese cities to the ground
starting on March 10th 1945. We killed more people the first night, we
firebombed Tokyo, than we killed at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and
we were systematically burning Japanese cities to the ground. Why?
Because we did not want to invade the Japanese main islands. [This is
what happens w]hen a great power feels threatened"
