H2 View: "easyJet: Hydrogen flights can’t come soon enough.. 'When
we.. looked back a few years ago, we realised clearly that the climate
emergency is coming our way and that we needed to address our
sustainability issue – and we knew that our passengers care about that
as well..

It was about the time when we started to see the first electric cars,
the Tesla vehicles.. and there was expectation that everything would
go electric. However, once we got into the detail and the physics and
the science behind electric, it became clear that battery-powered
aeroplanes were not going to have sufficient energy density to power a
large commercial aircraft'"

And the tech that can do long-distance, air flight, heavy-duty, will
end up doing it all

H2 View: "Transitus Energy has received new funds that will enable the
company to scale its operations in the UK and Thailand in order to
support the production of blue hydrogen... Jack Peck, CEO of Transitus
Energy, said, 'Hydrogen will be our best chance of reaching Net Zero
carbon targets, because hydrogen decarbonises those parts of the
economy that electrification cannot meet. Hydrogen is especially
suitable for domestic and industrial heating, long distance
transportation, industrial manufacturing, shipping, air travel, and
power balancing'"

H2 View: "A creative new method to produce sustainable hydrogen from
natural gas or biogas has received a $3.4m backing by the European
Union to scale the technology... Developed by Norway-based SEID, the
Project ColdSpark technology produces hydrogen in a low temperature
and pressure environment unlike other high-temperature pyrolysis
techniques"

CNBC: "German power firm RWE has signed an agreement with Neptune
Energy to develop a green hydrogen demonstration project in the Dutch
North Sea, targeting an electrolyzer capacity of 300 to 500
megawatts.. [and use an] existing pipeline used to funnel the hydrogen
to shore. The pipeline’s capacity ranges between 10 to 12 gigawatts,
the companies said.

'The energy transition can be faster, cheaper and cleaner if we

Offshore is too risky. Am fine with fossil as long as wildlife is not
harmed. For NG, no flaring, no fracking. 

"[Haaland's DOI's] highest-profile action so far has been
November’s auction of oil and gas drilling leases in the Gulf of
Mexico, the largest in the Gulf’s history, justified by spurious
logic. The department claimed it was compelled, hands tied, to hold
the sale due to an earlier court ruling that reversed the pause on new
drilling permits on public lands in the Gulf. In August, a memo filed
by the Department of Justice contradicted that assertion, finding that
the government was not, in fact, forced to issue new permits...

Among those top-level aides is David Hayes, special assistant to the
president for climate policy. A BigLaw alum from the firm Latham &
Watkins, Hayes first served under Bill Clinton’s interior secretary,
Bruce Babbitt, and then eventually as the Senate-confirmed deputy
secretary of the interior under Clinton. After spending the Bush years
at Latham, he returned [to the department... ] where he was the deputy
secretary of the DOI [.. during] the Deepwater Horizon spill"

Whenever I hear "tolerance" it sounds like ghetto toleration to me..

Some think relating to any minority should be like interacting with
aliens.. They like to play *Dances with Wolves* with "foreign

can peek into and tell their friends about to prove how cool they are.

"Seaborg Technologies.. is working ...  to develop a molten salt
thermal energy storage technology that can store large amounts of
intermittent wind and solar power... 'Normally no chemist in their
right mind would look at anything as corrosive as sodium hydroxide,
Seaborg CEO, Troels Schönfeldt, told pv magazine. 'However, in the
development of our reactor, we needed to use sodium hydroxide and were
forced to develop these methods.'..

Sodium hydroxide can be produced at low cost from seawater as a
byproduct from chlorine production. Seaborg said this is six times
cheaper that standard salts used for storage"

At the height of US's logistic support campaign to Britain during
WWII, it was building one cargo ship a week, these so-called Liberty
ships, which were monstreous vessels, quickly put together but they
did the job, carried necessary cargo to Britain. US could do that - it
had the know-how, could creatively speed up a major industrial
process.

Military is a function of a country's underlying economy, and the
economy is a function of its inherent diversity. If a country is
producing nuts and bolts it can put them together for a weapon during
the time of war. If one is producing only bolts, they can't build
shit.. This is why Beckley's power measure is ingenious; it captures
all that through a simple base econ value.

---

It's not entirely correct to judge a country's power by looking at its
military size, its ships, guns. Military power is also a function of
what a country *can build* on demand, when all the chips are
down.. That is deeply related to its industrial, tech capacity, its
economy.

The 'French Trump" is new but if its him against EM, voters will flock

Once I heard that "ala Kärcher" saying was still a hit in FR politics,
I thought 'they are still regurgitating old stuff from Sarko days over

side... Macron might just win this thing.

Not sure the Great Game (from the 19th century), and the Cold War is

If as an answer to any Ukraine invasion Japan/US take those disputed

to put a big fat base there.

Everyone who lived in US knows, mailboxes would get filled with offers

---

How do credit card companies end up as villains in a movie?
Easy. Perfectly fits with the stagnating "creditor-paradise" described
before. Stagnant wages, no inflation, low rates.. What does that lead
to? It creates an opportunity for a lender to borrow money cheap and
lending it, adding little interest, to the guy who has a low wage and
wants to buy stuff. Debt slavery follows. Unrest.

---

I actually joined a DOE Webinar and got that quote from the said expert. 🤓

---

CSP Expert: "There are several potential ways of generating hydrogen
using CSP. A number of researchers (and a couple of startup companies)
are developing 'solar thermochemical water splitting' which uses a
catalyst (like ceria) at very high temperature to split steam into
hydrogen and oxygen. CSP can also be integrated with high temperature
steam electrolysis (using solid oxide electrolysis cells) to
electrolytically split water at higher efficiencies than typical PEM
electrolyzers"

If Bulgaria spends four times as Sweden spends on heating, this means
their insulation is probably four times worse. Likely true for many
countries in the world. Fix that, cut emissions by 20%. Blend 20% to
existing natgas infra, another 10%.

---

That sounds right

"Buildings account for 36% of EU GHG emissions and 40% of its energy
use: energy efficiency is the most cost-effective method of reducing
their emissions.'.. Innovative SMEs based in the EU are developing a
range of solutions for a more energy-efficient building stock...
[such as a]dvanced low-carbon materials, including high-performance,
unobtrusive insulation techniques"

[[-]](https://www.cleantechforeurope.com/blog-posts/energy-efficiency-policy-proposals-from-the-eu-innovation-community)

---

Nearly 40% of energy use cannot possibly be causing 20% of the
emissions. 

"Heating, cooling is responsible for 20% of GHG emissions"

H2 View: "US Senators discuss clean hydrogen at an energy
committee.. US Senator Joe Manchin has discussed the positive impact
clean hydrogen could have on the domestic economy.. 'That is why I
made research, development, and demonstration of these technologies a
central part of the Energy Infrastructure Act..  In that bill, we fund
$9.5bn in research, development, and demonstration of clean hydrogen
and we task the Department of Energy to develop a national strategy
and roadmap to get us to a clean hydrogen economy'"

Doubling nuke plants globally sound far-fetched.. Too many are freaked

they'll be fine with that.. not here'

"EU sanctions would target Russia’s financial and energy sectors if

There were gazillion different ways of saying what he said that in a
debate. You say 'we'll look into the issue', 'I hear some of the
concerns of the parents' blah blah..  invite them in, even include
them somehow.. But then keep teaching the truth.

That's not what this mucker did. He blew a fuse, got all mad, bcz the
real issue is there were two people on that debate connected to the
Carlyle Group, they have nothing else to disagree on, so the Dem
libtard gets triggered. The situation could easily be deflected,
instead TM gave the other side ammunition for culture war. But guess
what - in culture wars Reps have a chance too, so he had his ass
handed to him, proving once again the bizarre Dem moderate centrism
has a long-term electability problem.
