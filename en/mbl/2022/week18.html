<p>Undoubtedly an H2 based economy will play into the strengths of some
new players who can reach sunshine regions easier then they could
reach oil/gas rich regions, and import energy cleanly through
renewable fuels. US was the king of an earlier era, it had its own
natural resources, and the military to get to OPP (other people's
petroleum). But we cannot keep the existing system forever.. The world
needs more energy, and climate change threatens to destroy us all. I
believe renewable fuels will democratize the use of energy and make
everyone richer. Power dynamics will change but that cannot be helped.</p>

<p>"Cancel the debt then change the system" - that comment from before
sounded conflated, actions with political ideologies..  What is
described would be the outcome, the long-run result of right-left
back-and-forth oscillation, not one party doing it all.</p>
<hr />
<p>Right-wing wouldn't remove functional programs. Look at Canada. They
had a few conservative governments since the enactment of single-payer
(Tommy Douglas!). Were they removed? No.</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually the permanent policy of left should be to <em>always</em> cancel the
student debt whenever they are in power. I bet that would encourage
the right to abollish those programs <strong>pronto</strong> when they can; and
that's fine too, the left can then later enact less market-intrusive
programs, they'd remain (bcz they'd f-ing work).</p>

<p>'Morgage stress'? But lower house prices would translate into lower
rent prices in a few years.. Renters don't matter? In Oz home owners
do not dominate as I understand even with historically low rates (bcz
low rates create a flurry of activity pushing the home prices up so
high most cannot afford them, even with low rates).</p>
<hr />
<p>Rates can go up just like they can go down.. it's party of a cycle.
There is nothing ultimately right or wrong about it..</p>
<p>The Mandarin: "[Oz] Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said the board
believed it was the right time to start pulling back the support it
has given to the economy during the pandemic."</p>
<hr />
<p>There is no deying that. But Nazis also created some fringe benefits;
would the US Apollo program be possible without Wernher von Braun?  He
developed his trade while building rockets for Nazis. If there is no
space program there are no additional inno that comes from
it. Scratch-resistant lenses, teflon, velcro.. Have a funky sport shoe
with velcro? You can thank the Nazis for that. You can thank the Brits
for..  some institutions here and there, fine.</p>
<p>"Britain's presence in some countries helped their democratic
institutions"</p>
<hr />
<p>Do I think Brits caused as much damage as Nazis? That's probably
true... The partition in India alone caused 1 million deaths. That was
done for strategic reasons, it didn't have to be done, but it was done
so UK could meddle easier in the region's affairs. Tally it all up
maybe you could reach the number of Jews killed by the Nazis.</p>

<p>Current cultural and genetic make-up of Anatolia is overwhelmingly
local. Similar people, culture have been in the land for at last ten

foreigners in their own land. Nationalists are deluded.</p>
<hr />
<p>For the outers having the Turkist ideology active in Anatolia was
useful; it reinforced an 'outpost' mentality among the
locals. Followers of the ideo foolishly believe they 'just' arrived,
right? Hence they are constantly 'fighting to hold on to their new
home land', they see everyone around them as enemies. That is useful
for the outers, here is a guy on guard, fearing every near neighbor,
well then they would be more willing to ask 'friendly' outers for
help, include them in their affairs more, wouldn't they?</p>

where it’s used today, industrial processes feedstock for chemicals,
opportunities for decarbonised heat and energy that's currently being
fulfilled by natural gas,” Nash explained. Transport, heavy duty long
haul municipal fleets, waste trucks, community buses are all potential
transport demand sources. And then with Kwinana’s access to fantastic
pipeline infrastructure will have the opportunity to support WA’s
target of 10% hydrogen blending [in the state’s gas grid] by 2030'"</p>

<p>Arab Nationalism could be a threat for France I guess through Algeria,
Morocco, so they wanted it 'handled' through Israel.</p>
<p>The National News: "Israel had long wanted a nuclear weapon of its
own, but was isolated diplomatically in the years after its founding
in 1948. But by the mid-1950s, that had changed. Western powers were
so concerned at the rise of Arab nationalism, and in particular the
leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser, that they conspired in 1956 to use
Israel to attack Egypt and bring down Nasser. That plan failed, but it
began a long association between the West and Israel.</p>
<p>It was France, in particular, enraged by the failure in 1956, that
began building Israel’s bomb. By the end of the 1950s, there were
hundreds of French scientists and technicians living in Dimona,
teaching Israelis how to master the nuclear fuel cycle..</p>
<p>In the years since, the Israelis openly lied to the United States
during inspections, supported brutal regimes like Apartheid South
Africa in order to get its hands on materials, conducted test
explosions in violation of international treaties, spied on allies and
censored the press at home. When a disgruntled technician, Mordechai
Vanunu, told the world Israel had nuclear weapons in 1986, he was
drugged by Israeli agents, kidnapped and jailed for nearly 20 years
after a secret trial"</p>

<p>China-Pakistan nuke share is widely known. France-Israel rel is
interesting.. What did FR have to gain from that?</p>
<hr />
<p>From an earlier share on nuke tech; Russia gave nuke tech to China and
India. One viewpoint seeks clues for RU-CH rivalry, but when RU could
withhold one of the most destructive weapons ever invented, they
didn't even blink an eye and chose to share - just gave it away to
those two countries. They wanted strong neighors IMO to stand together
with towards the outside, rather than weak neighbors they could lord
over inside. RU,CH,IN, likely feel more threathened from outsiders
than eachother.. That nuke share needs to figure into every analysis
on the region.</p>

<p>Bottom of his heart.. How <strong>sweet</strong>.</p>
<p>Wikileaks: "Sarkozy is the French politician who most supports the
role of the United States in the world.. His nickname is 'Sarkozy the
American' and his affinity for America is authentic and comes from the
bottom of his heart"</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06PARIS5974_a.html">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Sarko was little stupid, an odd duck.. Certainly no Chirac. After his
term he was dragged through the mud quite a bit, had the crap beaten
out of him.</p>
<hr />
<p>He forgot his country's future lies with the inner alliance, not
meddling outers, and went ahead and helped topple the guy who could be
useful for him / Europe, soon after that very same leader had declared
intensions of opening up Libya and sign energy deals with Europe.</p>
<p>"Sarkozy played a role in Libya's destruction"</p>

<p>How does liveuamap determine occupied regions during coflicts? "[It]
has a method to harvest, select, and curate social media
information... Liveuamap assumes control by drawing a polygon around
events and, given the large number of social media events it contains,
is able to generate areas of control"</p>

<hr />
<p>The RU advance is reverse-engineered from Liveuamap images; given two
known pixel-coordinate mappings, can calculate lat,lon from image. In
small areas it's close enough.</p>
