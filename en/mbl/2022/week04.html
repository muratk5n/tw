sustainable fuels.. The announcement regarding the contracts was made
by Saudi Arabia’s energy ministry. The contracts are for the
development of carbon-free projects such as hydrogen fuel cells for
transportation, and sustainable jet fuel production. They are meant to
help the largest crude exporter in the world to shift its leadership
into 'all areas of energy, as it has been in the oil industry for over
80 years,' explained energy minister..  in an official statement

<p>OO was seen as a way to be more "scientific" about IT software. The
approach did not save projects which typically went over-time and
over-budget at a rate of 1/2. They still do. For bigger projects the
failure rate is even higher, a whopping 4/5.</p>
<hr />
<p>For Valley, IT programmers the particle, and their interactions,
simulation viewpoint was comfortable.. Their bean counting is done
discretely, item-by-item basis, which makes sense you are automating
an office work, keeping lists, checking them off...  The so-called
object-orientation took hold in the industry possibly for this reason.
Interesting its widely used language C++ was based on an older
language called Simula, the first OO language, literally built for
simulations.</p>
<p>With OO the idea was coders would create "Customer objects" which
interacted with "Order objects", so the entire system would be seen as
a "simulation" btw these little particles..</p>

<p>The successful vaccine programme proved a 'super-weapon', [PM]
said. 'It has given us a solid defence against infection that
continues.. That's why the government decided that coronavirus should
no longer be considered a threatening disease for society.'</p>
<p>Faced with a lower level of hospitalisations than in previous waves,

<p>God does not need math, He has an obscene amount of computation power
embedded in nature. Mathematics is our invention, a tool that was

<p>CIA likely stirred shit up leading to pro-Russian Yanukovich's ouster,
but left to its own devices democracy long-term would have balanced
things out.. A major voter base for Yanukovich was the RU speaking
parts of Ukraine, so the next guy would have to pander to them, and
indirectly to Russia for votes. Those regions are now gone. If UKR at
least tried to balance RU against the West before, they'll never do
that now.</p>

<p>Language is not a good indicator for cultural similarity; Asia Minor
speaks Turkish but it is not Turkic.  US and UK speak English but are

Russians and Ukrainians are Slavic brothers, Russians won't understand

<hr />
<p>They cld make money from such a service; For every major event,
sharing up-to-date geolocated, structured data.. What happened, where,
to whom? People would curate it in the background, and more frequent,
special access could pay for the service costs..</p>
<hr />
<p>Military activity data shared by API (simple URL, JSON output) through
journos would be great..  Liveuamap has paywall. Just types of attack,

<p>From the book <em>The Meat Racket</em>: "GIPSA [is] the antitrust regulator
that was created before the Great Depression specifically to regulate
U.S. meat companies...  gained its authority over meat companies from
a law called the Packers and Stockyards Act, which was passed in 1921.
The act was passed with the goal of breaking up the 'meat trust,' a
collection of five companies that controlled about 85 percent of the
market (a lesser degree of concentration than existed in 2000).</p>
<p>By 2005, GIPSA seemed to have drawn into a shell of
nonenforcement. The reasons were partly due to the reorganization
overseen by James Baker, the Stetson-wearing GIPSA chief who ran the
agency during the Clinton era.  Baker’s prime initiative as the
antitrust regulator was to reshape the agency in the image of the
highly concentrated meat industry that it oversaw"</p>
<hr />
<p>It's Bill Clinton's fault</p>
<p>"In the US, meat processing is in the hands of a few corporations. For
beef, it is JBS, Tyson, Cargill and Marfrig that together control 85
percent of the market"</p>

Mr Senator, for six years so u feel less of a pressure the House deals

<p>Computation split into two cultures since its inception; one is
scientific computation (discretizing formulas), the other business
coding, w databases, "UI". The two cultures gathered around their own
computer languages, Fortran for sci, Cobol for biz. These are two
different ways of thinking about computation.. Silicon Valley is full
of the latter type - the business brogrammers. They pretty much have
zero understanding of science and how it is conducted. So it behooves
all tech watchers to pay attention to that difference as the typical
tech CEO is sci ignorant, bereft of any understanding on what makes it
tick.</p>

'coders' who are really digital bean counters.. They believe they can
fix all by 'knocking out some code', or now a "neural net".</p>

<p>That makes sense gold has no intrinsic value, brings no interest, pays
no dividends. In a potentially rising interest rate environment people
will sell it. Recently price went down, it will go lower as rates
rise.</p>

dollar hegemony. There isn't enough gold to form the backbone of an
intl system. Let's not goad people into stupid investments.</p>
