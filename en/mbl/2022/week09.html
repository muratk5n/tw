<p>Yahoo Finance: "ExxonMobil said today it is planning a hydrogen
production plant and one of the world’s largest carbon capture and
storage projects at its integrated refining and petrochemical site at
Baytown, Texas..  The proposed hydrogen facility would produce up to 1
billion cubic feet per day of "blue" hydrogen, which is an industry
term for hydrogen produced from natural gas and supported by carbon
capture and storage. The carbon capture infrastructure for this
project would have the capacity to transport and store up to 10
million metric tons of CO2 per year, more than doubling ExxonMobil’s
current capacity"</p>
<hr />
<p>They produce the neutral fuels by mixing in carbon into a clean fuel,
turning it into synthetic fossil fuel, since it is fossil existing
engines are already prepared for it. If the carbon is captured "from
the air" then putting it back through combustion would not change the
overall budget, voila.</p>
<p>Cant say I'm crazy about the approach, creates a path too easy to
cheat. Remember Volkswagen, a world famous company, w production at
huge scale, headquartered smack in the middle of Europe still cheated
on their emissions mechanism.. With synthetic fuels one day companies
might just burn some coal on the side, get its carbon, then we will be
back to square one.</p>

<p>IT has a long history now around adopting, popularizing, marketing
packages; lots depend on them. Each has its own way of use / access,
and professionals want to learn a few, stick to that, and sell it,
"evangalize" it to others. They mostly have no bleeping idea about
what goes on inside.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is another reason why this "AI" talk is prevalent, bcz IT types
picked up on it, they see it as a nice "package". And current
incarnation of this said AI is exactly that, a black box essentially,
you shove data into from one end, "predictions" come out from the
other (which of course is the problem as far as AGI is concerned).</p>

<p>IT profession today is mostly about packages, Gone are the days of a
"hacker" coding up everything from scratch (Linus Torvalds is probably
the last famous one who did). Now it's all about a package, picking
one, learning one.. IT professionals do not write a database from
scratch to insert a new record. There is a database <em>package</em> and they
just call a function named <code>insert</code> in that package, passing data as
parameter, and voila. A new record.</p>

<p>Business Insider: "[A]fter more than a decade of keeping interest
rates near zero, the Federal Reserve is all but assured to raise them
multiple times in the coming year to fight inflation. In the world of
finance, these hikes are akin to messing with the Earth's
gravity. Assets that were once attractive — companies that used cheap
capital to grow rapidly without making a profit — will be
shunned. Some of the investors who ate up those growth stories will go
out of business.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, the most pressing problem for central banks
around the world was the meandering recovery from the financial
crisis. Growth was sluggish, and inflation was well short of their
target, prompting the Fed and others to keep interest rates
historically low to encourage banks to give out loans and juice the
economy. A side effect of making money easy to borrow was that all
kinds of garbage ideas could get funding and all kinds of garbage
companies could stay in business. Combine that with lax corporate law
enforcement and you have Wall Street without consequences. Investors
were champing at the bit to pile into companies that used fantastical
metrics, like WeWork, and lapped up every utterance from billionaire
CEOs who promised flashy technology but consistently underdelivered,
like, say, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>And that was before millions of bored, homebound Americans jumped into
the market via Robinhood and other trading apps. Armed with their
pandemic-era stimulus checks, they bought crypto, piled into
blank-check companies called SPACs, and joined message boards claiming
that stocks like AMC and GameStop were going "to the moon." Awash with
capital, companies — especially in tech — saw their valuations leave
Earth's atmosphere and make a home somewhere on Saturn. Short sellers
were culled. Value investors went into hiding.</p>
<p>'We really did hit peak stupid, but peak stupid extended beyond truly,
truly stupid and then we went to
bottom-of-the-ocean-rare-earth-metal-companies stupid,' the value
investor told me.</p>
<p>This is the kind of bubble a financial professional should see forming
— one where investors lose sight of fundamentals like profitability
and cash flow and embrace a kind of Beanie Baby zeitgeist. In
fairness, on Wall Street you can make a lot of money dancing to the
music at a bubble party. Or you can stand by the snacks and
watch. What you cannot do is pretend that the music will never stop...</p>
<p>Investors Like Cathie Wood — perhaps the most starry-eyed of all the
investors betting on moonshot (at best) technology who've caught fire
during this bubble — will soon come to find that precious few are
interested in a stock that might quadruple in five years if it can't
show how it will generate the cash to fund its business until
then. Wood's Ark Innovation ETF made a truckload of money for
investors in 2020 until its peak in early February 2021 (yes, during
all the meme-stock insanity). But since then Woods' ETF has cratered,
losing about half its value from its peak to its current trough...</p>
<p>Hiking rates from their decade-plus doldrums is nothing short of
economic regime change. The stock market we had before isn't coming
back. It will take a year or two of the highs getting lower and the
lows never bottoming before it's all over. After that, we'll be living
in another world. In the meantime, get your bathing suits on and
prepare for the washout"</p>

<p>RU is self-sufficient, have meat, grain production, and hell, lots and
lots of hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>Biden is not talking to MBS? Why not? Bcz he is bad? Had a journo
killed (which is bad)... but Putin flattened Grozny and everyone was still
talking to him afterwards.</p>

<p>Barron's: "Members of the OPEC+ oil producers' group will meet
Wednesday to discuss loosening the taps -- just days after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine sent crude soaring past $100 a barrel"</p>
<hr />
<p>Politico: "After just one day of the invasion, Russia effectively
controlled nearly a third of the world’s wheat exports.. Importantly,
while hydrocarbon production can be immediately surged in different
places to meet shifts in requirements, grain production cannot be
surged in the same way, and even a major expansion cannot make up for
the sheer volume of agricultural output that Russia now controls
either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Most of the focus has rightly been on the invasion’s impact on people
in Ukraine’s most populous cities — but in the background, Russia is
completing a hostile takeover of the country’s grain-rich regions and
their associated transportation infrastructure...</p>
<p>[T]here are only two points of maritime access that Russia needs to
dominate in order to be in control of Ukrainian grain shipments: the
Kerch Strait that connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov, and the
17 ports in and around Odessa.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Russia had closed access to the Sea of Azov, and, ...
Ukraine has closed all its commercial ports. Ukrainian grain is now
offline"</p>

<p>Near history:</p>
<p>Aug 2010: Once in a century draught in Russia devastated wheat crops
forcing Russia announce a ban on wheat export. 80% of Middle East's
wheat came from Russia.</p>
<p>Dec 2010: The Arab Spring is sparked by the first protests that
occurred in Tunisia, following a street vendor's self-immolation</p>

<p>WSJ: "Germany to Raise Defense Spending Above 2% of GDP.. The nation
will boost defense spending and create a strategic natural-gas
reserve, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, marking a significant shift in
reaction to Russia’s war in Ukraine"</p>
<hr />
<p>If it is not important why are some trying to expand it? It clearly
<em>means</em> something to be in it, as well as outside, and it is
potentially against someone, even in defensive form.</p>
<p>"But NATO is not that important, RU is making a big deal of it"</p>
<hr />
<p>It was the former IMO</p>
<hr />
<p>Mustache is now saying 'Trump was too buddy-buddy with Putin but we
sent ATWs to Ukraine behind his back, that's why there was no
invasion during his time' 😆</p>

<p>The fail is so pure, it is now in solid form, it is shit. It's
everywhere.</p>

<hr />
<p>What more could they occupy? Beyond Belarus and Ukraine there is
NATO. Putin wont attack a NATO country - he is not stupid. On the
other side, NATO already expanded as far it could, reaching its
limit. Right? Otherwise UKR's NATO membership would be
discussed.. That clearly did not happen, not after 6/2021 by this
President, not even after 2014 after Ukraine lost pieces of itself to
Russia. On the downside the current limbo status is not enough to
deter, creates further chaos. It is probably a good idea to finalize
it now.</p>
<p>"But will giving in on UKR neutrality entice RU to attack more?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Yeah - there are still no Nazis in Ukraine... Barking up the wrong tree son</p>

<hr />
<p>Go for neutrality. Finlandization. Or maybe in the future we will call
it "Ukranianization".</p>
<p>"Ukraine agrees to hold talks with Russia at the Belarusian border"</p>
<hr />
<p>Additional manpower, weapons did not help in Syria. Sanctions did not
help for post-Ukraine invasion 2014.</p>
<p>Trying to "shame" RU on moral grounds is useless. Even if they are an
evil force, there is a rational way to deal with them. Their actions
do not reflect on full democracy, as RU cannot claim to be one. But
democratically elected leaders, being responsible for the safety of
their citizens, are on the hook to provide safety. They need to have
the capability to handle this "evil force". You might be
democratically elected, but then have democratically get bit in the
ass by a wild bear, and democratically have your ass handed to you.</p>
<hr />
<p>Its clearly about tanks, as we see now.</p>
<p>Not just tanks, I dont want to nag on the "weapon help" countries are
providing to UKR, even manpower, but it's more than that, you need to
have an integrated warfare capability just like RU (and US).</p>
