At the mid level K could be thousands, D could be millions, for small
M and N, you end up with a small M by N matrix.

I bet some started to realize what the approach could be used for ;) 

---

Can have probabilities on those transitions, and each cld represent a
decision, each "type" of decision could be one level. Then example M
by A in the beginning, leading to A by K, K by D, D by N... on and on,
no matter how long the path is, simple multiplication will sum over
all those paths you end up with likelihood of being at an N cell
(decision) starting with an M starting point.

---

What's more, the paths can be as long as possible, mat mult will
collapse them, will summarize "all paths".

Col Macgregor: "Moscow’s determination to destroy Ukrainian forces at
the least cost to Russian lives prevailed. Ukrainian casualties were
always heavier than reported from the moment Russian troops crossed
into Eastern Ukraine, but now, thanks to the recent failure of
Ukrainian counterattacks in the Kherson region, they’ve reached
horrific levels that are impossible to conceal...

The recent Ukrainian advance to the town of Izium, the link between
Donbas and Kharkiv, seemed like a gift to Kiev. U.S. satellite arrays
undoubtedly provided Ukrainians with a real-time picture of the area
showing that Russian forces west of Izium numbered less than 2,000
light troops (the equivalent of paramilitary police, e.g., SWAT and
airborne infantry).

The Russian command opted to withdraw its small force from the area
that is roughly 1 percent of formerly Ukrainian territory currently
under Russian control. However, the price for Kiev’s propaganda
victory was high—depending on the source, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000
Ukrainian troops were killed or wounded in a flat, open area that
Russian artillery, rockets, and air strikes turned into a killing
field...

Given Washington’s inability to end the war in Ukraine with the defeat
of Russian arms, it seems certain that the Beltway will try instead to
turn the ruins of the Ukrainian state into an open wound in Russia’s
side that will never heal. From the beginning, the problem with this
approach was that Russia always had the resources to dramatically
escalate the fighting and end the fighting in Ukraine on very harsh
terms. Escalation is now in progress.

Washington always mistook Putin’s readiness to negotiate and limit the
scope and destructiveness of the campaign in Ukraine as evidence of
weakness, when it was clear that Putin’s aims were always restricted
to the elimination of the NATO threat to Russia in Eastern Ukraine"

H2 Fuel News: "Cummins has.. unveiled a medium-duty concept truck
using an H2-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE), which drew
substantial attention in Germany at the IAA Transportation
exhibition. Similarly, Westport Fuel Systems also unveiled its own
HPDI hydrogen ICE engine for heavy duty vehicles earlier this month...

There are a number of benefits that hydrogen combustion engines have
to offer over fuel cells. To start, the technology used by ICE is
already familiar to engineers and mechanics worldwide who provide
maintenance and repairs to trucks and other medium- and heavy-duty
forms of vehicle, equipment and machinery. The technology could be
incorporated into a spectrum of types of vehicles and machinery, not
just trucks...

Cummins demonstrated the ease of H2 ICE deployment by exchanging
a Mercedes-Benz Atego 4×2 truck’s diesel engine for a 6.7-liter H2 ICE
engine. Performance, cargo capacity and payload were all fully
preserved.

Westport has gone so far as to say that its own H2 ICE engine offers a
notable increase in performance when compared to its diesel
equivalent, including 20 percent more power and 18 percent improved
torque.

By using diesel engine architecture and engine manufacturing
infrastructure already in place, Westport has said that its engine
offers the lowest-cost opportunity for achieving CO2 reduction target
compliance. This could also help to minimize a company’s transition
cost while decarbonizing.

'We like to think of it as a game changer without the change,' said
Westport Fuel Systems CEO David Johnson when referring to hydrogen
combustion engines"

The HDS product suite handles conversion of H2 to LOHC (hydrogenation)
and taking H2 out of LOHC (dehydrogenation). Storage capacity of the
products isn't even listed; IMO storage is practically unlimited,
anywhere diesel is stored, the organic carrier can be
stored. Conversion rates are reported (2018), 400 m3/h hyd, and 640
liter/h dehyd.

---

Could oil pipelines can be repurposed to carry LOHC since it is an
oil-like substance? Natgas pipelines with some refurb carry H2 gas,
oil pipelines carry this liquid.

---

LOHCs, Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers, have seen some commercial
development lately, there is a suite of products from a company called
Hydregenious, partnered with MAN Diesel&Turbo (known name in the
petro-chemical industry). If advertisement is true, H2 can be
transported as an oily, diesel-like substance, at room temperature,
inert.. Therefore any infra (trucks, trailers) that can carry oil can
be used to carry LOHC.

"Poland amended laws to speed investment in nuclear energy In September
last year, it was announced that six large pressurized water reactors
with a combined installed capacity of 6-9 GWe could be built by 2040
as part of Poland's plan to reduce its historic heavy reliance on
coal.

S. Korea will raise nuclear power to one third of energy
supply.. France [is looking to] build up to 14 new nuclear reactors by
2050.. China alone expects to invest some $400 billion over the next
15-20 years to build –hold on to your seat– 150 new nuclear reactors.

But what does make Japan a special case is that it had been one of the
most anti-nuclear countries of the last decade.  And at the same time,
also one of the most serious about nuclear research, before Fukushima
of course.  Thanks to this situation, one of the major players in the
Japanese plan is now the so-called High Temperature Engineering Test
Reactor, the HTTR [or HTGR], which Japan wants to be the type of
reactor that will shape the long-term future of nuclear energy in the
country..

In fact, [HTTR] reactor, which is located in Ibaraki Prefecture, has
been undergoing tests for more than two decades. And now it seems that
its time has come..

[We talked about] three main types of hydrogen: gray, blue and green.
Well, the truth is that there is another one, a fourth type of
hydrogen: pink hydrogen. Which is, precisely, the one produced with
nuclear energy..

Japan is one of the countries that is taking the hydrogen issue most
seriously. And as you can now see, their new civil nuclear program has
a lot to do with it. And if we’re talking about hydrogen and Japan, we
are not talking about an idea or a futuristic pipe dream, but a
fact..

Japan's Strategic Energy Plan, approved in October 2021, states that
precisely this type of high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor
will be used to produce hydrogen.  In addition, the Green Growth
Strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, dated June 2021, states
that HTTR reactors will be required to produce emission-free hydrogen
in large quantities and at low cost by 2030. Which, in strategic
infrastructure terms means it’s just around the corner"

---

"[O]ne of the major players in the Japanese plan is now the so-called
High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor, the HTTR, which Japan wants
to be the type of reactor that will shape the long-term future of
nuclear energy in the country... The main peculiarity of this
helium-cooled reactor is that it does not need water, which means that
it can be located practically anywhere on the planet. What’s more, due
to its design, the core cannot go into fusion. So, in theory, it is a
revolution.  In addition, and this is very important, it can operate
at very high temperatures, over 900 degrees. And so [with high heat],
it is able to produce large amounts of hydrogen"
