<p>H-Tec Systems presents scalable Hydrogen Cube System..The company
H-Tec Systems from Augsburg presented the Hydrogen Cube System, HCS
for short, to a wider specialist audience at the Hanover Fair 2022...</p>
<p>The Cubes are available both as a closed container solution for
outdoor installation and open for indoor installation. They are
equipped with 18 PEM stacks S450 and integrated process water
treatment and power supply...</p>
<p><img width="340" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hzwei.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-H-TEC_HCS_5-gross.jpg"/></p>
<p>Several 2 MW cubes of this system can be combined to form a
multi-megawatt system. A system that is intended to achieve 50 MW in
the long term can also be designed in this way. According to H-Tec
Systems, the cubes achieve a system efficiency of 74 percent. They are
equipped with an integrated process water treatment and power
supply. An HCS system with five units, i.e. with an electrolysis
capacity of 10 MW, can therefore produce 4,500 kg of H 2 per day. That
makes 40 to 50 tank fillings for trucks or buses.</p>

<p>#Delegation Trip to Austria and Italy! Here are the main take-aways</p>
<p>1) When it comes to decarbonization, the new language is “hydrogen”
(besides #renewableenergy) 💙</p>
<p>2) #Hydrogen will partly be transported via pipelines (e.g. European
Hydrogen Backbone Initiative #EHB) – so we must take the right steps
and find the right partners now </p>
<p>3) The #energytransition is a joint goal ➡️ only achievable through
international cooperation – hydrogen is a perfect example!</p>
<p>4) Our #LOHC technology = a great solution for transporting
#greenhydrogen via ship to Italy, where the hydrogen could be injected
into pipelines💪 </p>
<p>And: #Hydrogen will come from all over the world, so we need all
transport options and act in a #technology-open manner!"</p>

<p>For two teams we can look at their past K games, within that calc goal
avg, passes per minute, bad passes per minute, fouls per minute,
number of completed passes per minute in the attacking 30%/20% of the
field (see how detailed it is), it goes on... Taking such stats for
two teams even eyeballing one can probably gauge a winner. "AI" just
automates that, adds another layer of (let's be honest here) extremely
simple linear regression, and reports a result.</p>

<p>A lot of soccer games can be predictable. If you feed in gazillion of
base data points through "feature engineering" than even simple stupid
logistic regression will predict something. There are companies
providing such raw, so-called touch-by-touch data. See

<p>RFK was ok on some left issues, but fell short... Supported the war in
Vietnam in the beginning, and promised to send 50 fighter jets to
Israel if elected president. That's why that Palestenian assassin was
radicalized and shot him literally one year after the Six-Day War.
Why support the civil right movement but be ok with Palestenians
getting bombed go bits?? Half-assed left - the perennial problem of
America. That is why RFK is dead.</p>
