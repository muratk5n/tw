<p>Hot molten <em>magma</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Magma goes as high as 1600 C and is liquid so we know high temp allows
liquids. The sun surface is 5600 C. Easy experiment, take frozen lava
pieces, heat them up to 5600 and see if they become "plasma".</p>

FUKKED</p>

<p>Calc assumed known distance between Sun and the Earth, known period of
revolution, the constant $G$ (already known from experiment, not
through reworking same equation). Sun's distance, volume could be
estimated optically or now through spacecraft having actually traveled
there. We then calculate mass, divide by volume, obtain density.</p>
<hr />
<p>Water's density is 1 $g/cm^3$. Sun's estimated density 1.41 $g/cm^3$,
greater. So not less dense than solid or liquid. </p>

<p>Inner/outer bickering is not a mere extension of a "post-WWII order".
China was on the winning side then (notice the seat at the UNSC), but
they are now the competition. After the fall of the Berlin Wall Russia
transitioned into free markets, democracy, yet they still had NATO
crawling up their ass. No the reason for the animosity is beyond the
so-called spread of freedom. Russia could be a bastion of democracy

<p>Excessive love for immigration, wanting open-borders is likely a
deluded by-product of rabid liberalism with its focus on
individuality.. To them the immigrant is 'expressing his/her
individuality' by choosing to emigrate to a liberal country like the
US. They want to fight for the immigrant just like they fight for
people's inalienable rights abroad and topple governments in their
name (which actually benefit oil and arms manufacturers but hey it's
the thought that counts). However such free love creates a point of
contention with traditionally left-leaning labor as more people
increase competition for wages. Cesar Chavez, a Hispanic union leader
