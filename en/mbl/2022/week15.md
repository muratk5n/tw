Hydrogen Central: "DOE announces $4 million for improving hydrogen
turbine performance and reducing hydrogen-based energy costs.. [DOE
announced] funding to advance the development of ceramic-based
materials to improve the efficiency of hydrogen-fueled turbines that
may one day be used in clean power plants.

Specifically, this R&D will enable operation at 150 degrees Celsius
(°C) higher than current CMC technology and 450 °C higher than
existing nickel-based materials allow, while reducing the amount of
cooling air required"

Well if value of NFT art is its direct connection to the true
originator, then second, third resale would have no meaning, in
digital realm. With a real Picasso painting, the connection to the
originator is through the hard painting itself.

AFP: "NFT of first-ever tweet a dud in online auction. The highest
offer so far is just shy of $10,000 -- a year after it was bought for
2.9 million dollars."

Hot molten *magma*

---

Magma goes as high as 1600 C and is liquid so we know high temp allows
liquids. The sun surface is 5600 C. Easy experiment, take frozen lava
pieces, heat them up to 5600 and see if they become "plasma".

---

If the sun is not gaseous a lot of the theories on the Universe are
FUKKED

---

Calc assumed known distance between Sun and the Earth, known period of
revolution, the constant $G$ (already known from experiment, not
through reworking same equation). Sun's distance, volume could be
estimated optically or now through spacecraft having actually traveled
there. We then calculate mass, divide by volume, obtain density.

---

Water's density is 1 $g/cm^3$. Sun's estimated density 1.41 $g/cm^3$,
greater. So not less dense than solid or liquid. 

---

Oh yeeeaaa

[[-]](../../2022/04/gaseous-sun.html)

---

Then if we can prove the sun is more dense, say than water, do we
sprove the Sun is not plasma?

---

I see, less dense..

"Like gases, plasmas..  are less dense than solids or liquids"

---

The sun is plasma some say

---

[facepalm]

PBS: "[2020] Astronomers still don’t know exactly what the sun is made
of.. It's not just the true nature of dark matter that eludes them; so
does the essence of the stars that speckle the sky and populate the
many galaxies throughout the cosmos. Surprisingly, no one knows the
stars' exact chemical composition: how many carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen atoms they have relative to hydrogen, the most common element"

H2 View: "[With a new] process.. methane pyrolysis is used to produce
hydrogen. The input is methane (or natural gas)... Rather than CO2,
the process creates carbon black as a by-product. Unlike CO2, carbon
black is a solid product and hence easy to capture and use or
sequester. Carbon black in turn is used to produce the rubber for
tires amongst other applications, giving it resale value rather than
being a pure waste product"

actively involved in the market.. This was a show about the life of
government employees BTW.

Inner/outer bickering is not a mere extension of a "post-WWII order".
China was on the winning side then (notice the seat at the UNSC), but
they are now the competition. After the fall of the Berlin Wall Russia
transitioned into free markets, democracy, yet they still had NATO
crawling up their ass. No the reason for the animosity is beyond the
so-called spread of freedom. Russia could be a bastion of democracy
tomorrow, they would still not be accepted as an ally.

Excessive love for immigration, wanting open-borders is likely a
deluded by-product of rabid liberalism with its focus on
individuality.. To them the immigrant is 'expressing his/her
individuality' by choosing to emigrate to a liberal country like the
US. They want to fight for the immigrant just like they fight for
people's inalienable rights abroad and topple governments in their
name (which actually benefit oil and arms manufacturers but hey it's
the thought that counts). However such free love creates a point of
contention with traditionally left-leaning labor as more people
increase competition for wages. Cesar Chavez, a Hispanic union leader
[did not support](../../2021/03/ship-of-fools.html#chavez) open borders.

Another advantage of ranked-choice system over the two-round approach;
TRS cuts off the next round candidates at two. With RCS the third
candidate close to the second (and the first) might have shot up with
