Lockdown parties.. bad bad. Britain's culture code for itself is
CLASS. By ignoring the rules BJ said "I'm above you" (reaches emo
brain, very powerful). It's particularly damaging for BJ bcz his whole
shtick was being "against the elites". "Elites" wanted Bremain,
"people" needed Brexit. Cameron looked like an "elite", BJ was the
pudgy, everyman looking guy (both grads of Eton but ssshhh), so when
BJ did the elite thing, it became 10 times more damaging.

---

The new off kilter ideology backdrop cld also be partly why UK BJ was
too gung-ho on Russia (even before the war); conservatives are
generally hawkish, well, this was one 'conservative' thing he could
still do..

---

Politics in some Western countries are off-kilter.. During the UK
trucker shortages I actually heard PM BJ say "well if there are
shortages, maybe businesses should pay better wages". A Tory
PM. Asking higher wages. It's like someone said the moon is made of
cheese, or I walked to school and back, up the hill both ways..
It's good to hear but from a supposedly con party?

For 80g prot intake daily, for 10 days, u'd need roughly 3 kg of red
meat. Dam.

---

It's not uncommon to get 70-80% mass reduction on poultry/meat after
dehydration. Makes sense we know we are 70% water. That hints at max
protein content; cant possibly get more than 30% protein from red meat
(lit says 26%), bcz the rest is water.

Many simple dishes out there. Toss raw spinach, diced onions, some
olive oil together, cook 5 mins medium heat. Wait until cold, mix in
plain yogurt. [Boom](twimg/FQm9U8BWUAcMm_F.jpg).

Similar to Persian borani, Greeks have a version too. Rich in lutein,
iron and with yogurt u get lots of calcium, protein.

The persecution of the religious folk played a major role for
enshrining freedoms into law in US, not "the affluents" feeling
slighted by bakers when denied a cake.

---

Things go off the rails sadly when they ask children to "choose" a
gender identity (be individual, early). But these are kids at an age
when they are busy playing make-belief games. One thinks he is a
robot, the other an elf.. One says he is a garbage truck. How do you
handle that one? Now your kid is a garbage truck. Do you treat him as
such?

---

US libs are so fervent believers of individuality that they will
create previously non-existing categories to give ppl "more
opportunities" to exercise that individuality. Notice the ever
increasing new letters to that already huge moniker, L, G, B, T, Q, it
goes on, I, A, 2S,.. They added a + on there too just to signal there
could be more. Pick any letter, pick two or three, see how that makes
you unique.

Forbes: "Angeles Link - by California utility SoCalGas, [will produce]
hydrogen from electricity generated by wind and solar power.. [Its]
infrastructure will include hundreds of miles of new pipelines
necessary to move the hydrogen to market... Once completed, the
company says the project will “allow four natural gas plants and 20
percent of big diesel container trucks to convert to zero-emission
hydrogen fuel – with the potential to reduce diesel fuel use by as
much as 3 million gallons per day in California.”  SoCalGas also
estimates that its new green hydrogen pipeline system will deliver the
clean energy equivalent of almost 25 percent of the natural gas
delivered by SoCalGas today"

which mix in existing gas pipelines 30 pc of hydrogen.”

Houston Chronicle: "Texas companies embrace hydrogen to retain energy
crown.. The world is determined to move away from burning fossil
fuels, but Houston could remain the energy capital of the world thanks
to a coalition of Texas businesses and nonprofits betting on hydrogen
helping the city retain the crown. The gamble is sound. Climate
activists agree that hydrogen molecules in either gas or liquid form
will help replace oil, natural gas and coal"

Some versions of HS missiles dont even have explosives - just sheer
kinetic energy; a mass of metal crushing into something else at Mach 5
speed or greater. Simple, fundamental works; mass, speed, pressure,
heat.

---

Hypersonics can be a big problem for ships.. I dont think a swarm of
HS can be stopped, they could potentially take out an aircraft carrier
if attacker knows where they are. With high-res satellite imaging
pinpointing a fleet could be possible too. Then during a war
satellites become a target. Enter Space Force. It goes on and on.

I hear there are some engine issues though..

J-20 is CH next-gen combat fighter plane. I dont think it can take on

Oz Economist Saul Eslake \#ABC: "Schemes that allow people to pay more
for housing than they otherwise would, will result in more expensive
housing, rather than more people owning housing. I dont think it's any
coincidence home ownership rate has been declining ever since the
first census after the first homeowner's grant was introduced by the
Menzies government in 1964.. The reality that all politicians are
aware of is that there is at least 11 million voters who own at least
one property, within that there are at least two million who own two
or more, and of course those voters want governments to keep doing
things that push house prices up... [the latest gov proposal] is yet
another example of that kind of scheme"

The claim is BW III will be based on a new commodity based Asian
currency - replacing the dollar-based system.

Pozsar: "If we are right, and if this is a “crisis of commodities” – a
2008 of sorts thematically, if not in terms of size or severity – who
will provide the backstop?  We see but only one entity: the PBoC!
Western central banks cannot close the gaping “commodities basis”
because their respective sovereigns are the ones driving the
sanctions. They will have to deal with the inflationary impacts of the
“commodities basis” and try to cool them with rate hikes, but they
will not be able to provide the outside spreads and won’t be able to
provide balance sheet to close “Russia-non-Russia” spreads.  Commodity
traders won’t be able to either. Remember that Glencore rose from the
ashes of Marc Rich + Co, and with Switzerland along with the
sanctions, Swiss-based commodity traders will think twice about
arbitraging the spreads.

But the PBoC [Chinese Central Bank] can…

.. as it banks for a sovereign who can dance to its own tune. To make
things more complicated, China is probably thinking deep and hard
about the value of the inside money claims in its FX reserves, now
that the G7 seized Russia’s...

The Fed and other central banks will be able to provide liquidity
backstops.. .. but those will be Band-Aid solutions. The true problem
here is not liquidity per se. Liquidity is just a manifestation of a
larger problem, which is the Russian-non-Russian commodities basis,
which only China will be able to close"

---

Pozsar: "[I]f you believe that the West can craft sanctions that
maximize pain for Russia while minimizing financial stability risks
and price stability risks in the West, you could also believe in
unicorns"

---

By CC=1 he means individual commodity prices are going up and down in
sync.

Pozsar: "Commodity correlations are also at 1, which, to stress, is
never a good thing. But that’s precisely what happens when the West
sanctions the single-largest commodity producer of the world, which
sells virtually everything..

The commodities market is much more financialized and
leveraged today than it was during the 1973 OPEC supply crisis, and
today’s Russian supply crisis is much bigger, much more broad-based,
and much more correlated. It’s scarier"

---

Did Russkies leave that big fat pile of reserve dough out there so they
could be seized, giving them excuse to demand rouble for gas? Makes
u wonder.

Pozsar: "Bretton Woods II was built on inside money [as in
petrodollar], and its foundations crumbled a week ago when the G7
seized Russia’s FX reserves"
