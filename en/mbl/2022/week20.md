Seperate vid talks about problems with long-distance electricity
transmission, and the ill-fated DESERTEC plan. All of the issues
raised there are moot for H2 pipelines which can transmit ten times
more energy at one eighth the cost compared to the grid.

NH3 is still useful as energy vector, it can be combusted in a turbine
(Japan Mitsubishi has the tech), used for carrier for other kinds of
fuel-cells.

---

That must be why ammonia company GenCell tout alkaline fuel-cells, the
tech works even with non high-purity H2, as opposed to PEM which needs
high-purity.

[[-]](https://www.ammoniaenergy.org/articles/gencell-launches-commercial-alkaline-fuel-cell-using-cracked-ammonia-fuel/)

---

Looking at the PE presentation again; they are especially focused on
compression, bcz apparently getting high-purity H2 is easiest that
way. Ammonia can carry huge amounts of H2, but getting high purity is
tough. From pg 10,

- Compression is integral to all three supply chains to increase the
volumetric energy density of H2

- Compression has minimal technical barriers..

- LH2 [liquid form] supply chain is significantly more complex with
additional energy intensive processes as well as onshore storage
requirements

- NH3 involves mature and well-developed technologies. However, if the
end user requires high purity hydrogen, then technical barriers and
energy penalty to crack and purify (reconversion)

BTW the heating energy calc [here](../../2022/01/heating-calculation-fourier.html) actually
takes energy used for cooling into account, indirectly; It calculates
the energy needed to raise (the average world temperature) from 13
to (room temperature) 22. Well, there are many temp levels
during the year that contribute to  that average. Sometimes it is -20,
sometimes 10, or 30. So by calculating 13->22 switch, we are
also calculating 40 to 22, for some places.

The Guardian: "But air conditioning and refrigeration are doubly

It is great Europe is creating the demand upfront, that can spur
companies to get their tech in order; Provaris CEO attended an H2 conf
and says the demand from EU is there, they want tons of this
stuff. Where there is demand, there will be supply.. so PE is building
tech for it. Enter the snowball effect; seeing supply, products will
arrive, which will create more supply. Only policy could start that
chain, bidness could not do it on its own.

Suiso ship used low temperature. The GH2 ship uses compression. The AU
company that built it is Provaris Energy. Presentation on the tech and
planned infra below. First ship is 26,000 m3 another planned 120,000
m3, compressed H2 at 250 bar can carry 700 kwh/m3 which means one trip
will carry 84.0 Gigawatt-hours, that is mid-size crude oil tanker
equivalent. Very good.

Can work backwards from capacity to output. LNG replacement? Get ship
capacity, number of trips, or simply an annual export amount giving a
Gwh, now work backwards from there, divide by 365, then 24 - once we
have calc down to Watt-hour within an hour, we can drop the hour, get
Wattage.

---

Converting energy numbers to a Wattage (kilo,giga) as in power input /
output helps to gauge how much of a power need can be met by existing
sources, and compare sources with eachother, no matter how long that
power would be needed (which takes us into Watt-hour, storage capacity
territory). A TV pulls in 60 Watts, an oven 1500 W. Russian NG export
to Europe is 167 Gigawatts (a lot of TVs can run on that
energy). Typical nuclear plant output is 1 GW, Fukushima (the one with
the meltdown) was 5 GW. Then it takes 33 Fukushimas to replace Russian
exports to Europe. Now in terms of environment policy that is probably
a non-starter.

If people's buying patterns truly changed, and -per WSJ supply chain

problems. And covid also effected the production itself.

Econ structure is a convoluted mess. Credit is given to companies who
use it to pay salaries to people. To increase salaries you have
increase credit. But there is no assurance that credit will go to
salaries, it can end up in the stock market. If money does go to
salaries, in excess, this can cause inflation which decreases the
benefit of that increase 🤦‍♂️ Also too much wage increase can hurt
company bottom line, then biz has to cut costs, fire people - now you
have no salary.

Money system: new money is given as credit to business, who in turn
give (some) of that money to people as employees. Money reaches
regular people through employment. That creates too much dependency on
biz, also gives them too much power.

The direction of money flow needs to turn upside down; people get the
money first, and *maybe*, businesses get credit down the line. Growth
should not be the primary goal, nor full employment. Right now both of
these issues command an overriding attention because, well, people's
livelihood depend on them.

Energy content, capacity is reported in kilowatt-hour or
gigawatt-hour; this is the amount of energy. Gigawatt (wout the hour)
is a rate, a flow of sorts; I lift a tons of water up, it has
potential stored energy (kwh, gwh). Poke a hole, water will flow out,
which has power in kw or gw, flow can turn a wheel, do work. Water can
have 2 KWh of (potential) energy, if I poked a hole for 1 kilowatt
worth, water runs out in two hours.

If there is fuel amount produced in a certain time period, eg x
barrels per day as below, I calculate GWh from that, divide by 24, I
get the power. It's easier to compare when all output is brought down
to unit time level.

The study confirms the optimal transport capability of H2; we can
project that scenario to onshore-onshore as well.. Producing green
fuel in North Africa pipelining it into Europe, or within the states
of US. See [Wires vs Pipes](../../2022/01/wirespipes.html).

Aquaventus: "In all three dimensions examined, offshore electrolysis
with pipeline connection emerges as the best approach: According to
the study, a pipeline for hydrogen generated offshore can be realized
up to five and a half years faster than submarine cable connections
for offshore electricity.. In addition, the investment would require
up to 6 billion euros less, reducing the production costs for green
hydrogen. From a permitting perspective and with a focus on
environmental protection, 610 kilometres of pipeline versus 3720
kilometres of high-voltage lines as well as the location of
electrolysis on the high seas also mean significant advantages in
terms of environmental impact"

It just occurred to me - if you zoom out enough - working from home is
the norm - not the exception.

For a bajillion years people worked in the local vicinity of where
they lived. Farming, hunting, and caring for their house and home.

"40% of the American public has less than a thousand dollars of savings
and they rent. Those people are seeing a huge reverse wealth effect
because.. they don't own a home they don't have a stock
portfolio. Because of the inflationary spurt through 2021 their
paycheck bought less and less they had a huge reverse wealth effect. I
think now FED policy is now oriented towards those 40 percent they
need to get inflation down.. Now we've got the politicians demanding
that they raise rates and raise rates aggressively to deal with
inflation because that 40 percent is behind" \#JimBianco

"@TheRealHoarse

Infant formula is a near monopoly. It is an oligopoly. Two main
producers. They serve a captive market without real alternatives...

People have no idea how many industries have consolidated down to only
a few very large players. The results are anti-competitive. The infant
formula shortage isn’t the crisis. The crisis is the country’s willful
failure to regulate capitalism. A formula shortage because of one
hiccup at one producer is just a symptom.

Davis: "In the modern era of warfare, there are a few key factors that
almost always result in victory for the side that best employs
them. In this war, Russia has advantages over the Ukraine armed in
important categories that will be hard for the UAF to overcome. First
is a clear Russian command of the skies. Yes, as many have pointed
out, Russia was unable to completely knock out the Ukrainian air
defenses, but they have badly degraded them such that Russia is
routinely able to fly between 200 to 300 sorties per day.

About a month ago, there was much notoriety that Ukraine had gained
the use of 20 fighter jets owing to supply parts provided by the
West. Yet there has been no apparent increase in the number of
Ukrainian jets attacking Russian positions beyond the five to 10 per
day reported earlier in the war. The reason is clear: Russian air
defense capabilities remain fully in tact and employ modern S-400
systems that makes any attempt to fly by Ukrainian pilots a likely
death sentence. Ukrainian air defenses still exist, but were badly
degraded at the start of the war, and continue to be knocked out by
Russian attacks. These realities underscore how hard it would be for
Ukraine to reverse the momentum in the Donbas"
