<p>To repeat, US sunshine states are CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM, CO, ID, WY. They
clearly have other resources too.. And perhaps expertise around

Sakai Port near Osaka. Upon reaching its destination port the ship was
even able to steer itself into its designated bay, with drones
dropping its mooring line.</p>
<p>The Mikage wasn’t purpose-built to be autonomous; the seven-year-old
ship was retrofitted with a system of sensors, cameras, and satellite
navigation. It followed a carefully-planned route while a control
centre on land monitored relevant wind, current, and weather data, as
well as details on nearby ships and potential obstacles.</p>
<p>Similar to how it’s easier for self-driving cars to operate
autonomously on highways than in unpredictable urban settings, the
Mikage didn’t have too hard of a time navigating itself through open
waters"</p>
