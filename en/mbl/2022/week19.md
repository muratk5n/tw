H2EG: "The landmark agreement [btw Shell and ZeroAvia] is expected to
be Europe’s first with eyes on creating a 100-metre-long hydrogen
pipeline that will run alongside the ZeroAvia hangar... With this
development, a suitable hydrogen refuelling infrastructure will be in
place in order to establish hydrogen technologies at the airport
leading to further innovation within the aviation industry.

Oliver Bishop, General Manager of Hydrogen at Shell, said, 'Shell
recognises the aviation sector has unique challenges in
decarbonization and needs practical and scalable net-zero
solutions.. We believe ZeroAvia’s technology is a viable option, and
this agreement will allow us to demonstrate successful provision of
low-carbon hydrogen supply while supporting development of codes,
standards, and refuelling protocols for hydrogen-powered aviation.'"

Aaand here is another port - great. 

H2 View: "Port of Duisburg and Port of Rotterdam to jointly develop
hydrogen hubs.. A letter of intent (LOI) has been agreed between the
Port of Rotterdam and the Port of Duisburg with plans to establish
hydrogen hubs in the surrounding areas of Germany and the Netherlands"

---

Rotterdam is a huge port sure, but still, there could be more, energy
cld be generated in Spain, Portugal, or imported into them from
anywhere in the Atlantic or NW Africa..

---

OK.. If Rotterdam will import 20 million tonnes of hydrogen (per year
I assume),


```python
print ('%d Gigawatts' % (33.6*20*1e6*1000/(1e6*365*24)))
```

```text
76 Gigawatts
```

That's pretty good... And that's just one port.

---

Europe imported 380 million cubic meters per day of gas by pipeline
from Russia in 2021. Natural gas has 10.55 kWh per cubic meters,

```python
print ('%d Gigawatts' % (10.55*380*1e6/(24*1000*1000)))
```

```text
167 Gigawatts
```

That is f--ing massive amt of energy; 167 nuclear plant worth right
there. Dam

H2 View: "The Queensland Government has signed a Memorandum of
Understanding.. with the Port of Rotterdam to jointly develop green
hydrogen export supply chains... [Minister for Energy] said, 'This
landmark agreement is another ringing endorsement of Queensland’s
quest to be a green hydrogen superpower'. The Port of Rotterdam has a
target to import up to 20 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050, starting
with imports of ammonia in 2025"

'No free-lunch' is a figure of speech (also a theorem in optimization).

In real-world it holds true. Most do not eat for free, but someone
else can pay for it ;) Left can say that other person can be gov. The
government already pays for many things that pro-business folk take
for granted (and exist because of it). SValley makes use of the
presence of great professors whose research is paid by the government,
roads paved, energy infra created by the government, the security
provided by the government and the open-source software provided by
mostly nameless contributers around the world. Well it is easy to be
'wild and innovative' a budding entrepreneur in this
scenario... providing the topping of the cake while making use of
free. We need free.

---

Start-ups or many estab players mostly dont pay for databases either;
Bigger players build their own DB software eventually but there is
Postgresql, and various other choices for all.

---

Before Linux, before open-source, commoditization, it would cost a
fortune to build a server farm.. I used to work in software consulting
partially during pre-OSS days, the price tag we gave to clients for a
few commercial machines with commercial OS, and databases would make
anyone's eyes pop today.

---

It makes sense, they spend a pittance to make that money. Big tech's
top item costs are probably mostly talent and server farms. The
machines in those farms are nowadays commodity hardware and run a
variation of open-source software Linux. Cheap and cheap.

Davis: "At present, most indicators, fundamentals of war, and current
battlefield trendlines support the prospect of a Ukrainian defeat...

In mid-April, Russia captured the critical transportation hub of Izyum
near the northern shoulder of the Donbas lines. Just days ago, after
nearly a two-month battle, Putin’s troops captured another key city in
northern Donbas that controls several essential road junctions in
Popasnaya. Kremlin forces have now pushed deeper into Severdonetsk,
putting Ukrainian troops at risk at Lysychansk, just to the southwest
of Severdonetsk...

Whether Putin has enough troops, ammunition, and time to complete the
destruction of the UAF positions in the Donbas without mobilizing some
portion of its reserve forces is an open question. What is clear,
however, is that Russia’s current operations are slowly strangling
Ukrainian troops in the Donbas and that despite optimistic rhetoric
out of Kyiv and Western capitals, the battle is trending towards a
Russian tactical success, possibly within two months...

Militarily speaking, there is very little hope that even all the
promised support of heavy weapons and ammunition from the West can be
delivered to the front, the Ukrainian troops adequately trained, and
firepower brought to bear in time to change the course...

By continuing to seek a military victory in Ukraine, Ukraine’s troops
will continue fighting, no negotiated settlement will be realistically
sought, and most likely Russian troops continue making progress. As a
result, more Ukrainian civilians and troops will continue to be killed
and wounded, more cities destroyed, and the economic and food crises –
for both Ukraine and the world – will worsen. The most likely outcome
will not change (a negotiated settlement, not a Ukrainian military
victory), but the cost to Kyiv will be much, much worse"

AP News: "[New] post-Brexit rules, which took effect after Britain
left the European Union, have imposed customs and border checks on
some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. The
arrangement was designed to keep an open border between Northern
Ireland and EU member Ireland, a key pillar of the peace process.

But the rules angered many [DUP members], who maintain that the new
checks have created a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of
the U.K. that undermines their British identity. In February, the
DUP’s Paul Givan resigned as first minister in protest against the
arrangements, triggering a a fresh political crisis in Northern
Ireland"

The party that wants broken island calls themselves 'unionists' BTW;
effective word play. They actually want to 'unify' with England.

UK limped on by playing an inner-outer game; it tried to balance both,
until it couldn't - enter Brexit.

I hope Ireland is unified, leaves UK. Ditto for Scotland.
England-centric UK proved it doesn't deserve to remain as single
entity. Now solidly in the outer alliance, they flail around in
desperation f-ing shit up everywhere.

Sinn Fein wants the eventual unification of Ireland, their rival DUP
is pro-England.

Brexit England is getting the shit kicked out of it; I like it

NYT: "Northern Ireland Turns to Sinn Fein.. Election results reflected the
demoralization of unionist voters, the disarray of their leaders and
an electorate with new priorities — much of which can be traced to
Brexit"
