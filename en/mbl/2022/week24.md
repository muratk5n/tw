cooled.

How to make beef tallow? Axe the butcher, 'need beef fat', they'll
have it on the side. Tallow has CLA, can't do without. No wonder
American Indians mixed fat into pemmican.

What would the military-industrial complex have to gain from JFK's
death? He was good to them. Increased their budget many times over the
years (whenever he was smacked around by the Soviets he'd go to
Congress and ask for more money, give it to mil).

If there was a conspiracy for the assasination of JFK it was a
conspiracy originating from Cuba; Castro might have wanted payback for
USA trying to assasinate him.

Gas-fired plants with CCS generating electricity is relatively clean
but inefficient. Electricity as a transmission mechanism has problems;
it is slow, generation has to match demand, exactly, every time. That
causes power plants to unnecessarily ramp-up, ramp-down their
production, and/or complicated mechanisms to try to predict power
usage. Storing electricity is expensive, batteries are too heavy,
based on rare earth materials, and prone to catch fire.

The problem likely is when your domestic resources become part of an
international supply/demand mechanism pricing problems can
ensue. You'd have the resources locally, but essentially be competing
against international customers to get at those resources. No wonder
some countries even nationalized the resource production capacity
outright.

Suspended? Daam

Renew Economy: "[Oz] Energy Market Operator has suspended the National
Electricity Market across all five participating states, saying the
market has become 'impossible' to operate because of the soaring cost
of fossil fuels and generators withholding their capacity from the
market... The extraordinary situation has been triggered by the
soaring cost of coal and gas. Generators who have to purchase coal on
the spot market"

---

Load shedding basically means there isn't enough supply so delivery is
cut (shed). Oz has vast natural resources though, they should be fine.

ABC AU: "In the electricity industry no two words instil a greater
sense of fear or failure as load shedding.. In order to avoid
circumstances where supply and demand become dangerously out of whack
the market operator can cut power to big numbers of customers to
restore balance — it sheds the load"

The spread of white collar work did not create smarter people who can

Need to reflect on the last great American thinker; Mark Twain and why
he was extremely negative on the virtues of the common man. US

---

Similar cultures modernize similarly; I look at the history of Greek
military coups I see a similar history to Asia Minor. Greece "the
birthplace of democracy" experienced numerous coups well into the end
of 20th century - the one in 1967 was the worst; it lasted until 1974,
their chief figure was a guy nicknamed "Greek Gaddafi". This guy
helped orchestrate the initial coup, did another coup while inside the
coup, and a seperate one all the way in Cyprus. Characters like that
were dime-a-dozen in homieland during the same era.

CCS at the source is ideal bcz if natgas travels in the pipes, goes

The amount of potential energy sitting in reserves in the form of
natural gas is huge, it would be foolish not to use it. Shared a post

world since the 40s - NF tops that!

---

That is great actually.. With some additional cost for CCS, blue H2
production can have little or no emissions. Until green forms of
production, if it arrives, the natgas path will increase H2 adoption.

H2 Fuel News: "US hydrogen production gets support from $8 billion

Markets only really crash from oversold conditions. Equity markets are
confronted with the unholy trinity of rising interest rates, a rising
oil price and a rising dollar. Selling by retail has been
minimal. Last Thursday saw record one day inflows. $ARKK has seen
inflows in 10 of the last 13 weeks despite a 50% YTD decline in share
price.. These are things one does not see at a bottom. The complacency
is staggering.  I fear that the investing public will soon get the
memo and that there will be a rush for the exits. The Fed safety net

You could replace the word Greece with Asia Minor and the story would
still make sense. Means of production defines (nearly)
everything. Cultures around near regions are similar (bcz they produce
similarly). Asia Minor has a lot of Hellenic culture in it. Obviously
as countries modernize they go through changes, but I argue similar
countries still modernize similarly.

Davis: "Throughout the first three months of the war, there were
almost universal positive statements by U.S. and Ukrainian leaders,
suggesting Kyiv’s troops would 'drive Russia from' Ukrainian soil and
that Kyiv would not accept any negotiated settlement that ceded any
territory to Russia. Yet earlier this week London’s *The Independent*
revealed portions of a leaked classified intelligence report out of
Kyiv that exposed a much harsher battlefield reality than had been
admitted publicly..

According to the report, Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukrainian
troops over the first 100+ days of the war had destroyed major
portions of their Soviet-era equipment and depleted their stocks of
artillery ammunition. The result is that frontline Ukrainian units are
outgunned 20-1 in artillery and an eye-popping 40-1 in artillery
rounds. Combined with the fact Russia continues to have significant
advantages in air power (up to 300 air sorties per day compared with
three to five for Ukraine) and manpower, it is not surprising Ukraine
is losing its grip on the Donbas...

While it is entirely understandable that no Ukrainian leader would
ever want to cede any of its country to an invading power, there are
other, harsher realities that must be taken into account.. Zelensky
and the Ukrainian people will soon come face-to-face with the ugly
prospect that continuing to fight will only bring more death and
destruction to its people, cities, and armed forces – but be
insufficient to stave off defeat. The truth is, military fundamentals
and simple capacity are in Moscow’s favor"

H2 based tech requires substantially less rare earth materials. There
are even some likely tech routes that wld require zero.

Pitron: "For example, there is 1,000 times less neodymium and 2,200
times less gallium than there is iron in the ground. The properties of
these metals make them essential resources for the [pure
electrification] energy transition. For instance, the engines of most
'zero-emission' cars and the rotors of offshore wind turbines are both
made of neodymium, a rare metal particularly prized for its magnetic
properties. Likewise, batteries of a large share of electric cars
could not be manufactured without resources such as cobalt, graphite,
or even lithium...

By seeking to break free from fossil fuels and create a new, greener
world, we are setting ourselves up for a new and more potent reliance

All that in dinky little Qatar.. The neighbors musta want a big bite
out of their NG reserves..

North Field.. Its reserves on discovery stood at 176 gboe, larger than
the largest oil field in the world, in terms of comparable raw energy (boe).

Al Monitor: "Qatar on Sunday named France's TotalEnergies as its first
foreign partner to expand the world's largest natural gas field and
eventually help ease Europe's energy fears... The French energy major
will spend an estimated $2 billion for a 6.25-percent share of the
giant North Field East project that will help Qatar increase its
liquefied natural gas (LNG) production by more than 60 percent by
2027, TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Pouyanne told AFP.

China has an extensive internal pipeline network, where are they
connected to / take gas from?  Eyeballing possible sources..  I see
some from "the Stans", but not much. A big source could be the LNG

makes sense \#ngmap

There isn't much going on betwen Japan and Russkie; they clearly do
not get along. Even before the Ukraine war, likely due to disputed
islands and other issues (inner/outer divide) their energy relation
was small. Japan gets oil via supertankers from Saudi Arabia, but not
ng via pipeline from neighboring Russia \#ngmap

---

The pipeline map.. The route around West Africa is nuts; It is between
Nigeria and Spain, but all the countries in between likely wanted a
cut, so little pieces go into all of them during transit \#ngmap

At the very least AUKUS presentation was off. The group projected a
"running the world" vibe, an "Anglo" formation evoking the previous
(and current) imperial structures. Execution was off; Macron was
slighted, he took a dig in the AU PM later which became campaign
fodder and it hurt the libs at the polls. China too, made a move in
the Solomon islands, very publicly, and I believe speficially timed to
influence the Oz election because they felt attacked through the AUKUS
deal.

Might have even annoyed Russia; All of a sudden all your detractors
are up on a stage looking like the *pezzonovante* of the region,
seemingly gearing up to go after China, they'd think who is next?

UP Jobs News: "Gas Networks Ireland joins major European hydrogen
project.. The European Hydrogen Backbone initiative is focused on
planning for the future development of a European hydrogen market
through new pan-European hydrogen transport infrastructure.

Five large-scale pipeline corridors are envisaged. These new corridors
will initially connect domestic local hydrogen supply and demand in
Europe, before expanding and connecting European regions amongst each
other, and then connecting neighbouring regions with hydrogen export
potential... The planned backbone network will largely be based on
repurposing existing natural gas infrastructure.

Gas Networks Ireland’s director.. David Kelly [says] 'Mapping the five
corridors in the new pan-European backbone will create more certainty
about the deployment of this new hydrogen infrastructure.. [T]he need
for hydrogen pipeline transport in the future European energy system

Neolib econ was more of a "trickle-up economy".. The gov funded
research, cheap credit, cheap global labor, commodity hardware, free
software created conditions for money flowing towards the top, from
the base. Not a mere trickle either, it was a flood.

Why is gross profit margin over 80% noteworthy? My friend, that is a
crazy number. Let's remember the Buffett criteria.. 20% is ok, 40%
great. This is over *eighty percent*. If you farted into a bottle and
sold it as a new fragrance you could not reach that number. The
bottling cost would kill you. But Big Tech just shifts some bits
around, builds on a monopoly position, uses open-source *free*
software, and commodity hardware in the backend - voila! Money pours
down like rain.
