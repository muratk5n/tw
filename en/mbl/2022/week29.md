Aha this is the famous methane pyrolysis process.. Nice.

"C-Zero's technology, which was initially developed at the University
of California Santa Barbara, uses high temperatures to split methane -
the primary molecule in natural gas and renewable natural gas- into
hydrogen and solid carbon in a process known as methane pyrolysis."

Nordstream 2 has same capacity as Nordstream 1. It is blocked though,
first by US (due to its persistent strategy around sowing discord in
Eurasia), now it won't get turned on due to the war in Ukraine. 1 and
2 combined gives 130 GW. 

---

As a comparison.. Nordstream 1 has a full daily gas capacity of around
150 million cubic meters. Natural gas has 10.55 kWh per cubic
meters, 10.55 * 150 * 1000000 / (24*1e6) equals 65 Gigawatts.

Crises' happen because the system insists on printing new money for
business credit which can cause bubbles, inflation, wage stagnation,
unemployment, and everything in between. The transmission mechanism is
too kludgy.

---

It would be ideal if the econ system was ready for a pandemic from
get-go; Lockdown caused savings build-up and supply disruptions,
globally. A money system prepared for that would have used digital
money that "prints" UBI monthly for everyone, by default, business
credit would get doled out of this new money, therefore people always
have money to keep them afloat. There can never be excessive printing
bcz printing at pre-decided level is the norm.

There is a place for the thriftiness in the pol spectrum, it
contributes to the average. I'm not interested in the spectrum which
actually indicates failure of analysis. The aim for analysis should be
to pinpoint the optimality before it is reached.

---

When govs decided to protect employment the direct result of that
would be inflation. No escape from that. The spend-thrift guy has no
extra analysis, he keeps repeating the same thing over and over.

---

Govs around the world wanted to protect businesses, through payment protection
schemes, encouraging them to keep employees. So many people stayed at home
getting payments, building up savings. After opening up those savings
became excess demand which helped a rise in inflation. Since many countries
(especially in the West) followed similar schemes, global inflation was
pushed up. Then there was the supply disruptions.

Renew Economy: "'Eureka moment' as Australian researchers make
hydrogen storage breakthrough.. A team from Deakin University’s
Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) in Melbourne says it has found
a new mechanochemical way of separating and storing gases, which is
safe, uses a tiny fraction of the energy compared to traditional
methods and creates zero waste.

The hero ingredient in the breakthrough is boron nitride powder, which
is has a knack for absorbing substances, being small, but with a large
amount of surface area. It’s also classed as a “level-0 chemical,”
something that is deemed perfectly safe to have in your house.

The researchers put boron nitride powder into a ball mill – a type of
grinder containing small stainless-steel balls in a chamber – along
with the gases that need to be separated.

As the chamber rotates at a higher and higher speed, the balls collide
with the powder and the wall of the chamber triggers a mechanochemical
reaction resulting in gas being absorbed into the powder.

One type of gas is absorbed quicker, separating it out from the
others, and allowing it to be easily removed from the mill. The
process can be repeated over several stages to separate the gases one
by one.

<img width="200" src="twimg/FX9zA-MWAAAxXrO.jpg"/>

All up, the process consumes 76.8 KJ/s to store and separate 1000L of
gases, which means it uses at least 90 per cent less than the current
gas separation process commonly used in the petroluem industry...

Even more significantly, once the gas is absorbed into the powder it
gas can be transported safely and easily. When the gas is needed, the
powder can be simply heated in a vacuum to release the gas unchanged...

[The team shows] there’s mechanochemical alternative, using ball
milling to store gas in the nanomaterial at room temperature. It
doesn’t require high pressure or low temperatures, so it would offer a
much cheaper and safer way to develop things like hydrogen powered
vehicles.

The next step for the IFM team is to gather industry support and scale
the process up to a full pilot. A provisional patent application has
been submitted for the process"

Missing ratings on either side are not a problem (most ppl dont watch

not stored, dot product calculation is smart enough to skip them and
treat them as zero. If nothing matched dot product gives a zero which
is cosine of 90. You are at 90 degrees to this person, "orthogonal",
at odds shall we say - no matches.  I don't pick that person's movies

H2 Central: "Monolith, a global leader in clean hydrogen, carbon black
and ammonia, announced its latest investment round of more than $300
million..

Monolith cleanly produces essential materials including hydrogen and
carbon black by utilizing an innovative and proprietary breakthrough
in commercial-scale methane pyrolysis, and was the first
U.S. manufacturer to produce clean hydrogen using methane pyrolysis at
scale.

This innovation attracted worldwide attention, prompting organizations
like SK to sign a memorandum of understanding last October with
Monolith to produce clean hydrogen and carbon black in South Korea. It
also generated a collaboration agreement and letter of intent with The
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company late in 2021...

The company has attracted the interest of numerous high-profile clean
energy investors and recently received conditional approval for a more
than $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy Loan Programs
Office to expand its production facilities in Nebraska"

Try sending electricity from UAE to Japan. That would be a pretty
stupid experiment, right?

Article prefaced that comment with 'still' assuming both previous
projects listed were not related to oil and gas? The clean ammonia
project was blue ammonia, meaning it was generated from natgas + CCUS.

Al Monitor: "[R]ecently, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company sent the
experimental energy form clean ammonia to Japan. In May, the Emirati
renewable energy company Masdar unveiled a plant that turns garbage
into energy. Still, gas and oil remain integral to the Emirati economy"

---

Al Monitor: "Clean ammonia from Abu Dhabi has made its way to
Japan.. [said] The Japanese oil company Inpex... The ammonia was made
via natural gas from ADNOC’s Fertiglobe joint venture with the Dutch
chemical company OCI...

Ammonia is a compound of hydrogen and nitrogen that can be used as
fuel. Blue ammonia refers to ammonia that is derived from hydrogen in
natural gas. Green ammonia is produced using green hydrogen, which is
made from renewable energy. So-called 'clean ammonia' comprises both
blue and green.. ammonia from Abu Dhabi is “clean” because the carbon
dioxide emitted from the ammonia production process was 'sequestered
and injected into Abu Dhabi onshore oil fields,' meaning it was not
released into the atmosphere"

Hubble tension.. When you assign a new term to ignorance all of a
sudden it sounds scientific. Why dont you say *we dont know what the
fuck is going on here*

"Multiple methods have been used to determine the Hubble
constant. 'Late universe' measurements using calibrated distance
ladder techniques have converged on a value of approximately 73
km/s/Mpc. Since 2000, 'early universe' techniques based on
measurements of the cosmic microwave background have become available,
and these agree on a value near 67.7 km/s/Mpc. (This is accounting for
the change in the expansion rate since the early universe, so is
comparable to the first number.) As techniques have improved, the
estimated measurement uncertainties have shrunk, but the range of
measured values has not, to the point that the disagreement is now
highly statistically significant. This discrepancy is called the
Hubble tension"

Is US in recession? Econ defines it as two consecutive quarters of neg
growth. Q1 quarterly growth rate annualized [was](../../2021/01/stats.html#gdp)
already -1.57%. Guesstimate for last Q, from FRED (the
so-called GDPNow number) is

```python
import util; df = util.get_fred(2021,"GDPNOW"); df.tail(1)
```

```text
Out[1]: 
            GDPNOW
DATE              
2022-04-01 -1.5245
```

Then there might be a recession declaration when the GDP number for
the last quarter comes out.

Davis: "Supporting Ukraine For ‘As Long As It Takes’ Is Not A Strategy..

Russia was presumed to require an operational pause after taking
Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in late June, but current evidence
suggests that, to the contrary, Moscow has kept the pressure on the
Ukrainian defenders. When the Ukrainian troops withdrew from
Lysychansk, they repositioned along a new line of defense,
north-to-south from Seversk, to Soledar, to Bahkmut.

As of Thursday, Russian and Western media were reporting that Russian
troops were already in the outskirts of Seversk, and within a few
miles of both Soledar and Bahkmut – and all three are receiving
withering artillery and rocket fire, along with air strikes. Once
Russian forces break through this new line of defense, the twin-cities
of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk lie barely 25 miles to the west. The
Ukrainian troops would be hard-pressed to put up a successful defense
of either, as Russia could drive the attack with its forces from three
sides"
