'But he resigned due to this reason, that reason'.. The last scandal
wasn't any more 'scandalous' than the one before it; the truth the
matter is the opposition, inside and outside, wanted BJ gone and they
threw everything but the kitchen sink to finish the job.

---

He has a chance, was considered as one the more capable ministers in
BJ cab. His resignation was also the last domino to fall, possibly due
to being lobbied by Tory internal oppo, likely coupled with promise
that if he resigned, he'd have their support as next PM.

Forbes: "This summer, when the first bulldozers rumble across central
Utah and begin excavating brine ponds, the Advanced Clean Energy
Storage hub will be breaking ground in multiple ways.

The construction will create massive underground salt caverns, giving
rise to the largest renewable energy storage facility anywhere in the
world. It also will kick off a new phase of the energy
transition. This unique project – part energy conversion, part
long-duration storage – promises to empower the technological and
infrastructure advances needed to realize hydrogen’s potential in a
net zero carbon future...

In June, the Department of Energy announced a $504 million loan
guarantee for the hub’s first phase, allowing construction to get
underway. As Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm put it, “This is a big
deal for the clean hydrogen space.”

Noise-canceling tech is a fantastic invention

"Sony’s MX5 headphones use microphones to pick up low-frequency noise
[from outside] before it reaches the ear by playing ambient sound,
effectively canceling out the invasive sounds... the music you’re
listening to is outputted at a lower frequency... less damaging to
your ears than just turning up the volume on your earbuds to make
external noise quieter. These next-level headphones truly mute.. the
volume of the outside world, making a simple walk around the
neighborhood feel like a cinematic experience or focusing while
working from home with loud roommates well, possible"

The Atlantic: "Not too long ago, I heard one of the leading Brexiteers
describe his political philosophy in a room full of CEOs and senior
politicians. He started by talking to this elite group about the great
division between 'elites' and 'the people,' the victors and the
victims of globalization, the haves and the have-nots of
modernity. The longer he spoke, the more his words began to seem rote,
remote, and stale. The energizing slogans of the Brexit campaign of
2016 sounded hollow and clich​​éd in 2022. Partly, this is because the
slogans were not true.

Globalization was indeed bad for some people and good for others, but
those groups didn’t split neatly along a rural-urban or rich-poor
divide, or along any other easily defined demographic line. Some
farmers in the distant countryside turned out to be huge beneficiaries
of Britain’s European Union membership. Some of the least-well-off
Britons benefited from foreign investment.

Besides, many of the people loudly attacking the “elite” were not
actually among globalization’s losers themselves. Boris Johnson was
the standout example of this phenomenon: He attended Eton and
Oxford.. , and his campaign was paid for by hedge-fund managers and
billionaires. More important, Brexit, the solution to the problem
Johnson and his supporters described, was based on a series of
lies. The electorate was promised that departure from the EU would
lead not only to fewer immigrants but to greater prosperity, more
welfare spending, less crowded hospitals. Instead, six years after the
vote, Britain is less prosperous and more unequal. Brexit reduced the
U.K. GDP by at least 1.5 percent even before it took full effect; the
U.K. has the highest inflation rate in the G7; small businesses,
especially importers, have been crushed by Brexit-related red tape and
supply-chain problems. Though committees have been set up to look for
'benefits from Brexit,' few are available"

The restrictions on the gas-fired plants sound fine.

Politico: "EU lawmakers Wednesday voted in favor of a European
Commission proposal to allow nuclear and natural gas-fired power
plants to be marketed as sustainable investments on financial

plants built through 2030 will be recognized as a transitional energy
source as long as they replace a coal- or fuel oil-fired plant, switch
to a low-carbon gas like hydrogen by 2035 and stay under a maximum
emissions cap over 20 years"

This was my worry... focus on pure green sources, while welcome, would

Sadat played for a post-conflict settlement to get Sinai back rather
than through military action itself.. New friends in US would be
necessary for that to work, so he sent the Soviets packing.. Smart
move. See, don't have to win militarily all the time to win something
valueable in military terms. 

History Channel: "Israel’s stunning victory in the Six-Day War of 1967
left the Jewish nation in control of territory four times its previous
size. Egypt lost the 23,500-square-mile Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza
Strip, Jordan lost the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Syria lost
the strategic Golan Heights. When Anwar el-Sadat became president of
Egypt in 1970, he found himself leader of an economically troubled
nation that could ill afford to continue its endless crusade against
Israel. He wanted to make peace and thereby achieve stability and
recovery of the Sinai, but after Israel’s 1967 victory it was unlikely
that Israel’s peace terms would be favorable to Egypt. So Sadat
conceived of a daring plan to attack Israel again, which, even if
unsuccessful, might convince the Israelis that peace with Egypt was
necessary.

In 1972, Sadat expelled 20,000 Soviet advisers from Egypt and opened
new diplomatic channels with Washington, D.C., which, as Israel’s key
ally, would be an essential mediator in any future peace talks. He
formed a new alliance with Syria, and a concerted attack on Israel was
planned"

H2 Central: "Refueling milestone to bring fuel cell hydrogen trucks
closer to reality. Federal researchers hope in July to reach a key
milestone to refuel heavy-duty fuel-cell hydrogen trucks in 10
minutes, paving the way to prototype hardware and protocols for
fueling stations...

Shaun Onorato, project lead at.. [NREL] hydrogen infrastructure
program for heavy trucks, described.. steps being taken at the
U.S. Department of Energy to make this cutting-edge technology evolve
from the drawing board into a reality...

'I kind of equate it to when the automobile first came out, people
were trying to figure out how to fuel cars and with what rates and
components. It’s really neat to be on that side of things where this
is just completely brand-new territory.'

He has been working with NREL’s heavy-duty hydrogen fueling station —
the world’s first — that was created to be highly configurable to
enable a greater variety of research tests.

'Currently nothing exists in this realm for this type of fueling. NASA
does things like extremely high-mass transfer rates of liquid
hydrogen, but this is completely new territory for the [FC] truck
market,' he noted, adding that hydrogen-fueled trucks in operation are
for light duty and use that type of refueling hardware.

'Some manufacturers use one nozzle or two to fuel the
trucks. Everything is based now on light-duty. This work will enable
the creation of a whole new set of components and protocols,' Onorato
said"

NYT: "Now Russian forces and their separatist allies control about 80
to 90 percent of the Donbas, according to Ukrainian officials.To take
complete control of Luhansk, Russia first devoted its full force at
the city of Sievierodonetsk, just across the river from
Lysychansk. After battering that city and eventually seizing control
on June 24, Russian forces set their sights on neighboring
Lysychansk.The twin cities were the last major population centers in
Luhansk Province under Ukrainian control. Now with both in hand,
Russia effectively controls all of the resource-rich region and can
regroup with Donetsk in its cross hairs. Controlling Sievierodonetsk
and Lysychansk means Russia could position its forces to mount
offensives on cities to the southwest, notably Sloviansk, Kramatorsk
and Bakhmut. Kramatorsk is one of the last major cities still under
Ukrainian control in Donetsk. If Kramatorsk falls, Mr. Putin's forces
will in effect control the whole Donbas region"

Centrist Democrats caused this whole mess by inflaming culture wars,
then not being able to fight it, were hammered, the current SCOTUS is
the result of that. But it cld be a sign of desperation too, pols
could not find a working political setup at the federal level, so they
resorted to these secondary issues, measures (and were pummeled by
them, making the system look like a joke -the country who fought for
abolishing slavery cannot guarantee basic freedoms to half of its
population-). Cant handle the federal level? Then well, maybe soon
won't have a federal level.

---

One could argue United States became united without proper discussion,
without proper debate, in a modern context. There was the civil war
around slavery, federal/local divide was always an issue, but division
settled.. too soon..? Post WWII the war-state bulldozed over
everything anyway and took over, without much discussion.

Europe is going through that discussion now, how states work together,
while still being distinctly seperate, we see some states join (and
some leave).  Stuff is being worked on... Maybe US needs to go back to
a clean slate, then start over. Be less united, then try again.

---

What to do about the "useless tinkering" approach commonly seen in US?
Maybe the latest SCOTUS stance against the "administrative state",
will have the side effect of US eventually disintegrating. Then there
won't be any experimentation of any kind at gov level, bcz nothing
will get done at that level.

The Atlantic: "In May, the Tribune was acquired by Alden Global
Capital, a secretive hedge fund that has quickly, and with remarkable
ease, become one of the largest newspaper operators in the
country. The new owners did not fly to Chicago to address the staff,
nor did they bother with paeans to the vital civic role of
journalism. Instead, they gutted the place...

The hollowing-out of the Chicago Tribune was noted in the national
press, of course. There were sober op-eds and lamentations on Twitter
and expressions of disappointment by professors of journalism. But
outside the industry, few seemed to notice. Meanwhile, the Tribune’s
remaining staff, which had been spread thin even before Alden came
along, struggled to perform the newspaper’s most basic
functions. After a powerful Illinois state legislator resigned amid
bribery allegations, the paper didn’t have a reporter in Springfield
to follow the resulting scandal. And when Chicago suffered a brutal
summer crime wave, the paper had no one on the night shift to listen
to the police scanner"
