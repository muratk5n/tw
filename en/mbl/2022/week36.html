<p>"Oxford quantum physicist Nikita Gourianov tore into the quantum
computing industry this week, comparing the 'fanfare' around the tech
to a financial bubble.. Despite billions of dollars being poured into
quantum computing, Gourianov argues, the industry has yet to develop a
single product that's actually capable of solving practical
problems... Contemporary quantum computers are also 'so error-prone
that any information one tries to process with them will almost
instantly degenerate into noise,' he [said]...</p>
<p>Despite the industry's less-than-stellar results, investors are still
funneling untold sums into quantum computing ventures. 'In essence,
the quantum computing industry has yet to demonstrate any practical
utility, despite the fanfare,' Gourianov wrote. 'Why is then so much
money flowing in? Well, it is mainly due to the fanfare.' The money,
he argues, is coming from investors who typically don't have 'any
understanding of quantum physics,' while 'taking senior positions in
companies and focusing solely on generating fanfare.'</p>
<p>In short, Gourianov believes it's only a matter of time until the
'bubble will pop' and the 'funding will dry up' — at which point, it's
already too late"</p>

<hr />
<p>Truss was the better campaigner.. That became clear at those
one-on-one interviews. There is journo, candidate, and live audience
but the format was geared towards the questioner. Sunak had a tendency
to forgo the journo, and say something to rile up the audience, as if
in an effort to drown out question.. Then you sorta break the format,
the questioner is annoyed, that reflects badly on you. Maybe not for
people in the audience but others watching through broadcast would
pick this up.. Gave the impression of a lack of media management
skills. Truss handled one-on-ones better, spoke direcly to
questioner. Also overall messaging was consistent.</p>

<p>Parties sticking to ideologies matters because people don't vote in
policies, they vote out people. Ergo when a new admin comes in, voters
should automatically get a different way of governing through that
different party. If voters are switching between globalist centrist

<p>Peter Voit: [See] <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6d2e34ab-f9fd-4041-8a96-91802bab7765">The quantum computing bubble</a> 
at the Financial Times, where Nikita Gourianov argues that there’s a
speculative bubble going on in this field, [he says]:</p>
<p>'Well, when exactly the bubble will pop is difficult to say, but at
some point the claims will be found out and the funding will dry up. I
just hope that when the music stops and the bubble pops, the public
will still listen to us physicists'...</p>
<p>I think Gourianov makes an important point for physicists to keep in
mind. Having this sort of hype blow up in physicist’s faces is not
going to help with the credibility problems physics already has with
the public due to decades of hype about non-existent breakthroughs in
fundamental physics</p>

<p>The ABC hasta la vista comment was funny because BJ said earlier "I'll

<hr />
<p>Nuclear fission is also free energy in many ways, the ratio of energy
obtained with energy applied is immensely large. It is possible to get
something for nothing.</p>
<hr />
<p>That sounds like free energy..  No additional energy input is applied,
when the catalyst splits water, is not reduced itself in the process
so it could do the splitting forever creating energy.</p>
<p>H2 Fuel News: "[Researchers] at UCSC [found] a way to complete [water
splitting for H2 generation] process at room temperature, without the
requirement of the electric input. They have done so through the
development of a special aluminum composite that causes a reaction
with the water at room temperature. Aluminum is naturally a reactive
material that will cause the oxygen to split away from water
molecules, allowing the H2 to remain...</p>
<p>The researchers discovered that by applying an easily created
composite of aluminum and gallium, the aluminum will react with water
even at room temperature, resulting in the production of H2 without
CO2 emissions"</p>

states.. suspended their gas taxes, which artificially pushes prices
lower. But the main reason for the fall is the decline in oil
prices. Crude is the single largest factor influencing gas prices,
accounting for more than 50% of what we pay at the pump"</p>

<p>SCMP: "Sinopec sets green hydrogen goals to help China reach carbon
neutrality by 2060.. China’s largest refiner aims to have an installed
capacity to produce 120,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year by the end
of 2025"</p>
<hr />
<p>If this election was about selecting the most un-BJ person, that was
actually Truss. Sunak's attitude was more like BJ, energetic speaking,
a whatever it takes attitude..</p>
<hr />
<p>Likely wont be a need to die anywhere, new PM can be more popular than
BJ for the mere fact she is not BJ.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why did Tories under BJ went after working class votes? Some of that
is due to Brexit.. Brexit could only be sold to the working class
(they were duped obviously), the EU was an "elite thing" and once it
passed, Tories were now 'stuck' with their new constituency, different
than their usual.. With BJ as PM they could appeal to them due to his
personality, but that all put the pro-business conservatives in a
funk..</p>
<p>Hopefully the new PM will act more a con, and end this bizarre
charade. If you will lose as a con, lose as a con. Die on that hill.</p>

<p>Growth potential of a country has an upper bound. Given a skillset
level, know-how, labor, access to materials, growth can reach a
certain amount, no further.  Any new money that exceeds that growth
potential will be inflationary. </p>
<hr />
<p>Credit to businesses can be inflationary.. This is key; most, for some
reason, exclusively focus on government spending a view goaded by MSM
likely to deflect the attention from the real source of money printing - credit.
When businesses go to banks for credit the bank does not use customers'
savings to hand out loans - they'll just print the money.
Once that money makes it to people's pockets through wages, if
in excess amounts, it becomes inflationary.</p>
