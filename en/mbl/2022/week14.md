the cardboard container, the plastic fork or the plastic chopsticks
that are with it and the little metal container. The whole thing can
go into our system. I don’t have to separate all that and we take it
wet, which is really unique. Many processes have to dry it. Many
processes have to be very selective on their waste, so it gives us
that ability to work very closely where waste is, whatever that waste
might be.. [This is] why Raven SR’s technology is making such waves in
the industry. Several waste products can be taken, including negative

strategy to deal with that is to reduce the varieties of products
manufactured"

War crime

Politico: "After a period of testing, on this day in 1962, President
John F. Kennedy gave final approval to.. a massive effort to defoliate
the forests of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos with an herbicide known as
Agent Orange...During the decade of spraying, more than 5 million
acres of forest and 500,000 acres of crops were heavily damaged or
destroyed...

Dean Rusk.. had told Kennedy.. that '[t]he use of defoliant does not
violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of
chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been
established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use
of aircraft for destroying crops by chemical spraying.'

In 1967, 17 Nobel laureates and 5,000 other scientists signed a
petition asking for the immediate end to the use of herbicides in
Vietnam. The administration ignored it...

The spraying program led some 3 million Vietnamese to suffer health
problems caused by exposure to Agent Orange, including a million birth
defects"

Some claim the dimming event triggered seismic changes in history;
famine displaced people who displaced others, discredited some
existing religions increased interest for new ones (eg Islam, Mohammed
was born in 570).

History Channel: "[I]n 536 A.D., much of the world went dark for a
full 18 months, as a mysterious fog rolled over Europe, the Middle
East and parts of Asia. The fog blocked the sun during the day,
causing temperatures to drop, crops to fail and people to die... 

Now, researchers have discovered one of the main sources of that
fog. The team reported in Antiquity that a volcanic eruption in
Iceland in early 536 helped spread ash across the Northern Hemisphere,
creating the fog. Like the 1815 Mount Tambora eruption—the deadliest
volcanic eruption on record—this eruption was big enough to alter
global climate patterns, causing years of famine.

What exactly did the first 18 months of darkness look like? The
Byzantine historian Procopius wrote that 'the sun gave forth its light
without brightness, like the moon, during this whole year.' He also
wrote that it seemed like the sun was constantly in eclipse"

Hey I like this "neomodernism"

Wiki: "Neomodernists maintain that truth still exists in a universal
form and directly refute existentialist and postmodern viewpoints that
the essence of an existent is formed in the observer's
bias. [N]eomodernism rejects postmodernism as:

Unscientific: the ability of science to generate useful knowledge
cannot be waved away as "scientism".

Journalism: as not giving any explanation as to how or why things
happen.

Local: as being unable to recognize patterns that occur across time or
location.

Unverified: as lacking any validation process, and therefore
proceeding by fad and hierarchy"

Simple fuel, projectile, molecule based approach is much better than
bitch-electric, bitch-magnet, bitch-laser approaches. Heat, pressure,
mass, molecules, protons, neutrons - these form the crux of what's out
there, ie reality.

"First Light is taking a unique projectile fusion approach to solve
[the] challenge, which it believes offers the fastest, simplest and
cheapest route to commercial fusion power. This means that instead of
using complex and expensive lasers or magnets to generate or maintain
the conditions for fusion, First Light’s approach compresses the fuel
inside a target using a projectile travelling at tremendous speed"

T. Frank: "Frederick Dutton, Democratic Party power
broker.. identified workers, the core of the New Deal coalition, as
'the principal group arrayed against the forces of change'... The
culture in those years was saturated with depictions of blue-collar
bigots doing scary things like shooting the main characters in Easy
Rider and rioting in support of the Vietnam War...

Still, a man like Dutton should have known better. A glance at the
union placards carried by marchers at Martin Luther King’s 1963 March
on Washington —or at the way the United Auto Workers lobbied for the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 —or at the 1968 strike of black sanitation
workers in Memphis—should have been enough to suggest that the Archie
Bunker stereotype was not the whole story. Besides, what kind of
Democrat gives up on basic economic issues in order to focus on
matters of 'the psyche' and 'the soul'? This was not politics; it was
psychotherapy. Worse: it was aristocratic hauteur disguised as
enlightenment"

shortage of drivers that threatens to derail — OK, further derail —
the supply chain. Except, the actual problem isn’t too few truckers,
it’s too few truckers willing to put up with all the terrible bullshit
truckers are forced to put up with"

Subtract imports from GDP (to see locally produced goods with locally
worked hours), divided total hours worked with it - gives numbers of
hours worked per unit GDP. Ratio has been decreasing for the past 70
years.

The reason for that decrease IMO is either technology, or too much
efficiency is being squeezed out of employees at the expense
of.. something. Wages? Maybe at Amazon you won't be allowed to take a
bathroom break?

*Bourne Identity*, the first movie in the series, isn't exactly a post
9/11 movie. It was written, filmed 1999/2000, due to delays it hit the
theathers 2002. That is clear to see in the content; plus the director
Liman's father was Senate chief counsel on the Iran-Contra affair, so
he was making a movie around that stuff, shady biz, underhanded
spycraft etc. Later two Bourne movies are different.

*Casino Royale* was a good action movie, no arguments there.

The migration that resulted due to the partition was especially bad
with deaths reaching up to a million. That too is on the Brits.

Al Jazeera: Before leaving India [1947], the British made sure a
united India would not be possible... East and West Pakistan were
hacked off the stooped shoulders of India by the departing
British.. Within months, India and Pakistan were embroiled in a war
over Kashmir, the consequences of which still affect us today. The
creation and perpetuation of Hindu-Muslim antagonism was the most
significant accomplishment of British imperial policy: the colonial
project of 'divide et impera' (divide and rule) fomented religious
antagonisms to facilitate continued imperial rule"

TDB: "IBM’s Watson, who trounced the greatest Jeopardy! players on the
classic game show—but needed to be hard-wired to the show’s
question-posing system. He was incapable of doing an autonomous task
that any three-year-old could do: listening for the host to finish a
question before buzzing in"

Sounds like bunch of unnecessary pain.. Test based restrictions are
excessive.. Left over policy from beginning of pandemic.

TDB: "On the day my wife and I were to fly home from London after a
brief visit, we took a COVID-19 test.. My wife’s test was negative. My
test was positive. She flew out.... So I was looking at 10 days of
hotels, which are not cheap in London. It’s not as if I can call a
friend here and say, “Hey, I got covid. Can I crash on your living
room sofa?”

[Gets covid] My symptoms quickly went away, and after four days I felt
fine again... But, now, how do I get back? Here’s the problem. There
is a chance that some little piece of the virus remains in my body. So
if I take another test and it’s positive, I’m stuck here again—with no
symptoms except a bleeding wallet"

Besides the need to provide bed-time stories for their shoddy
nation-building, Asia Minor Turkist propaganda was useful for British
interests; they could use it as a cudgel for the continuation of the
Great Game in Asia, eg if you can create an illusion of unity between
TR and "the Stans", some of which are "ethnically similar", u could
then be provoke those countries against their immediate neighbor.

But the act is getting old.. Plus TR's problems compound whose very
foundation was crooked (that's what you get with second rate
founders). People live in a bastardized world of their true culture
which is incompatible with national narrative that constantly leads
them astray, or at best, keeps them stagnant which is the case today
(middle-income trap).

Because US was caught doing undemocratic shit, its protests on the

Sisi the PR cover he needed for the coup.

Timeline reminder

Orban wins again. He is lambasted on immigration, but on process we

NYT: "Syrian mercenaries deploy to Russia en route to Ukrainian
battlefields Hundreds of Syrian fighters are en route to join Russian
forces in Ukraine, effectively returning the favour to Moscow for
helping President Bashar Assad crush rebels in an 11-year civil war,
according to two people monitoring the flow of mercenaries"

Moldova is NATO-friendly? If they were opportunistic they would give
Russia access for Western Ukraine in return for Odessa Oblast.

---

TBH Ukraine had ownership of some prime land that was beyond its
capacity to hold onto. They needed massive deterrence, or major
forsight on diplomacy to make self less threathening to others
(RU). Ukraine had neither.

---

Moldova was screwed, historically speaking; had zero sea access until
2005, now have a *tiny* port, and had to trade land with Ukraine to
get it. Reminds me the bitch borders of Iraq drawn up by Western
powers..  Sad.

In a natural evolution of borders Moldova would have the land reaching
all the way to the Black Sea, areas currently belong to Ukraine.

Immediate UKR south is in danger being closed off to sea access for
Ukraine. No wonder Odessa is being attacked.

---

The map suggests a possible region for attack would be that pocket
shown with arrow, and yes, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Lysychansk,
Kreminna, Hirske, Popasna Berezove, Toshkivka - all being shelled. If
RU takes the region the red block will get bigger.

MSM is not even providing Liveuamap level reporting here. See the red
regions in the map. Those are RU areas; not newsworthy?

there was just some extra hardware, they'd finish the war today

They had a seperatist group Tamil Tigers.. A coworker of mine was from
Sri Lanka and Tamil Tiger symphatizer. The group was defeated later, I
looked it up now, in 2009, with 40,000 ethnic Tamils dead throughout
the conflict. Is Sri Lanka getting some karma blowback here?

"How Sri Lanka Has Fallen Into Darkness..

April is the hottest month in Sri Lanka. Just unbelievably hot, like a
fever that doesn’t break until the rains. Heat makes everybody cranky,
irritable, and I suppose violent. April is the cruelest month, as they
say.  This is the worst April in Sri Lanka’s history. I don’t mean
that worse things haven’t happened—we’ve had pogroms, a tsunami,
various insurrections, a good thirty years of war—I just mean this
catastrophe is happening to all of Sri Lanka, all at once. No one is
safe from this disaster. It affects every single home.  At a very
fundamental level, the island has just fallen into the sea...

Why did this happen? Many reasons, and one family (the Rajapaksas).
Sri Lanka was an ancient irrigation civilization and in modern times
50% of our electricity comes from water (hydro). However, after
‘liberalizing’ in the 1980s we stopped building anything
useful. Instead we built giant generators that burn fucking oil for
the rest of our needs. This has been a farce forever. Now it’s a
tragedy.  Now we’re run out of oil for this generator, foreign capital
flows have dried up, and the whole thing has been managed
abysmally. The ruling family’s elder brother ran up the credit card a
decade ago and now the younger brother is paying off those commercial
bank loans instead of providing for our families.  And so the entire
country has blackouts, every day, for hours at a time. The entire
country waits in petrol and diesel queues"

There is a sequel too.. In this one Bruce Wayne decides to lobby the
government for his tax dollars to be spent more on social help, less
on stop-and-frisk bust-head-and-crack-skull approach mostly used in
Gotham. The sequel is titled "*Batman: Defunding the Police*". It
works, Joker, Two-Face get bored after a while, they declare they wont
show up for the whole trilogy, or even the prequels. 

---

Batman movies could be much shorter.. Bruce Wayne sees lots of crime,
then he thinks about what to do.. he think.. thinks.. while the camera
moves closer; the last scene is a near shot on BW when he says "I
guess I should pay my taxes". Done. The movie ends.

---

The saddest part in the Batman movies is when they lit up that 'bat
sign', essentially making city gov look like bufoons; the
establishment sales pitch here is "wouldn't an ultra-rich twat be
better to save your ass then the elected government?"

The gun is symbolism for a dick basically
