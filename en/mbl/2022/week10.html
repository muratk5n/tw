<p>"PETRONAS Hydrogen.. and ENEOS Corporation.. have signed a Joint
Feasibility Study Agreement (JFSA) to advance the studies for a
commercial hydrogen production and conversion project in [Malaysia].</p>
<p>Under the JFSA, both parties will pursue detailed technical and
commercial feasibility studies for the production of low carbon
hydrogen from PETRONAS’ existing facilities, production of green
hydrogen from a new hydro-powered electrolyser facility, and hydrogen
conversion into methylcyclohexane (MCH). The agreement is part of the
long-term [MoU] signed last August for the development of a clean
hydrogen supply chain between Malaysia and Japan.</p>
<p>The facilities are projected to have a total hydrogen production and
conversion capacity of up to 50,000 tonnes per annum (50KTPA) by 2027
for export in MCH form to Japan, where the clean hydrogen will be
distributed to Japanese industries through ENEOS’ refineries. Once
onstream, the project could potentially be the first commercial scale
hydrogen-to-MCH undertaking in the world...</p>
<p>Through ENEOS, this hydrogen-to-MCH project has been selected as one

<p>Am fine personally with individual, even positive rights. Just saying
countries can be on a different path, schedule. If a new non-military
org was to be founded for democracies, I'd argue it should only offer
carrot, no stick.</p>
<hr />
<p>Liberalism is about the individual, who can think freely, but that can
lead to conflicts, so you need a state to protect rights. Therefore,
one can continue, if everyone has such inalienable rights, they do so
all over the world too, a liberal state can try to expand lib abroad
(wanting to become that intl watcher that protects right for others
too) -- through coercion, or sometimes by force, which can entice 'the
other side' to the same.</p>

<p>What was the deal w NATO chief Stoltenberg "Central Bank appointment

cucked.</p>
<hr />
<p>NATO was sadly a disadvantage in this conflict. Motto "one for all,
all for one" works <em>if you are in it</em>. If outside, the deterrent
aspect becomes a disadvantage. They are built to kick some serious
ass, which means going all in, with everyone on board, which you
cannot do even partially in a situation such as in UKR. So they were
reduced to watching the whole conf from the sidelines. Putin finds
those blind spots, and exploits them well.</p>
<hr />
<p>My assumption was since 2014 UKR had been loading for bear (no pun
intended), had all aspects of a possible war covered, with NATO's
help. Then found out abt the air/sea shortcomings, it became clear
this cld turn into another Aleppo, Grozny.</p>

palaces. It's f--ked up).</p>
<hr />
<p>I first heard this angle in a 2021 movie in all places, <em>The King's
Man</em>, was pretty well done historically.</p>
<p>End of WWI saw the fall of two of those monarchs, and others too in
Europe. Maybe they got what they deserved, paid the price for their
uselessness.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Was WWI caused by a family feud?</p>
<p>Far from being remote rulers who knew nothing of their enemies, the
heads of state of Britain, Germany and Russia – George V, Kaiser
Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II – were first cousins who knew one
another very well.</p>
<p>A BBC documentary screened in 2018, <em>Royal Cousins at War</em>, told the
story of Wilhelm's difficult relationship with his parents and
antipathy towards all things British and argues that this helped bring
the world to the brink of war.</p>
<p>The three monarchs were like 'sleepwalkers stepping towards an open
lift shaft', Richard Davenport-Hines says in his review of Miranda
Carter's book on the subject, <em>The Three Emperors</em>. The events leading
up to the conflict are 'a study in the envy, insincerity, festering
rancour and muddle that only families can manage'.</p>
<p>Unlike many family feuds, however, disagreements between the royal
cousins exacted a geopolitical price. 'As relationships between the
royal cousins waxed and waned, so did the relationships between their
countries,' the Daily Mail's Ruth Styles says"</p>

<p>Different core energy sources all generating H2 fuel will
automatically ensure supply availability. Most cars use gasoline -from
crude oil-, much of heating uses natural gas.. But if crude oil and
natural gas <em>both</em> generate H2, and cars and heating <em>both</em> use H2,
then supply problems with either NG, or crude will be less
important. Not to mention solar, hydro which can be used to generate
clean fuel as well, adding to the supply, increasing the overall
resillience of the energy system. H2/NH3 will be the "molecular lingua
franca" of energy transmission, allowing all kinds of raw energy
source to be used by varied types of consumption.</p>

<p>"Now [some are] talking about a situation where you defeat the
Russians in Ukraine. This is a much worse outcome for the Russians
than what happened in April 2008, and a much worse outcome .. [than]
in February 2014...  [The R]ussians are not going to roll over and
play dead,.. they're going to crush the Ukrainians, they're going to
bring out the big guns, .. to turn places like [Kyiv] and other cities
in Ukraine into rubble. They're going to do Fallujas, they're going to
do Mosuls, they're going to do Groznies.</p>
<p>[Remember] what happened in [WWII] when the United States was faced
with the possibility of having to invade the Japanese home islands in
early 1945. The idea of invading the Japanese home islands after what
happened at Iwo Jima and then later what happened in Okinawa really
spooked us, so.. we decided to burn Japanese cities to the ground
starting on March 10th 1945. We killed more people the first night, we
firebombed Tokyo, than we killed at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and
we were systematically burning Japanese cities to the ground. Why?
Because we did not want to invade the Japanese main islands. [This is
what happens w]hen a great power feels threatened"</p>
