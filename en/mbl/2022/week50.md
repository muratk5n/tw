NDTV: "Peru's leftist president Pedro Castillo was ousted by
lawmakers..

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, one of Castillo's
staunchest allies, blamed 'economic and political elites' for a
hostile environment since the beginning of his 'legitimate
presidency.'

The government of Gustavo Petro, Colombia's first left-wing president,
called for dialogue involving 'all political actors,' adding that
'democracy requires the recognition of the popular will expressed both
in the elections for president and for Congress.'

Brazil was more critical of Castillo's actions, calling his attempt to
dissolve Congress a 'violation' of democracy and the rule of law"

can move electrons with light. The other was naphthol, which is a
fluorescent organic compound.. These combined molecules were exposed
to light and each molecule absorbed a photon and then worked together
to produce hydrogen fuel."

The draft might have played a role; >2 mil was drafted into Vietnam,
1% of population, that means more money was spent on people. Now
population of >300 mil has mil active personnel less than 1.5 mil. Gov
still deficit spends but if it all goes to Reytheon, Lockheed, from
there to some offshore haven, then to stawks, no inflation.

---

There is strong correlation with gov spending and inflation, but also
between growth and unemployment which makes sense, wages are major
contribution to inflation.

Doc mentions gov spending wasn't entirely for the war; LBJ did some
social spending (money went to ppl direct).

Inflation wasn't too high pre-73. Starting 73 it was but oil shortages
started then, and bunch of other stuff. Glad LBJ spent on social programs.

H2 LOHC Tech: One VLCC ship can carry up to 350,000 DWT which would be
equivalent to 17,000 tons H2. One train in Europe can pull up to 35
wagons which would be equivalent to 59 tons of H2.

A quick calculation shows the amount of energy that can be carried
across Atlantic by a fleet of 20 ships using LOHC techology,

```python
trip = 17000*1000*33.6 / (365*24*1e3)
print ("One trip, single ship %0.1f MW" % (trip))
print ("Fleet %0.1f GW" % (one_trip*12*20 / 1e3))
```

```text
One trip, single ship 65.2 MW
