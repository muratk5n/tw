# Week 30 

A MOON-LANDING MOMENT 

Microsoft: "Hydrogen fuel cells could provide emission free backup
power at datacenters.. A round of applause and shouts of joy from
engineers at Plug, who built the fuel cell system... The moment was
the latest milestone on Microsoft’s quest to find a zero-carbon
emissions replacement for the backup diesel-powered generators that
support continuous operations in the event of power outages and other
service disruptions.

'What we just witnessed was, for the datacenter industry, a moon
landing moment,” said Sean James, Microsoft’s director of datacenter
research. “We have a generator that produces no emissions. It’s
mind-blowing.'"

Customer churn analysis has these type of problems..  Tough to pin
down what churn is. Two months of non-activity considered churn? Maybe
the guy will be back after 65th day..? Maybe he was on vacation. One
approach I saw formulates the reverse (surv analysis), try to predict
how long 'not churn' will last. Then can ask the model for a
probability of certain 'not churn' period ahead, apply cutoff,
threshold on that.

---

How to prove that from data..? Data would have armament levels of both
sides over the years, plus whether they fought a war.. But how about
armaments which did *not* result in war..?

'Not war' is hard to pick from the data. If left out will introduce
(survivorship) bias. We see in data what we *can* see, not what is
actully happening.

cause another to arm, we can prove it"

Electricity is partially suitable as the *last* step in the energy
chain, not the first nor the middle. It can be generated close to its

is problematic.

Surely wage decrease sounds bad.. this is how the mechanism works
though - sadly.  That's the reason I advocate new money entering the

---

Certain MSM narrative is "if interest rates rise, spending decreases,
because people borrow to spend". That is not the primary driver of
price levels. The major transmission mechanism (though crude) is
through businesses borrowing and expanding less, so wages and spending
decrease, causing a decrease in prices.

This electrification business is a complete racket. Fish bait for

---

Lithium? You have to drive the electric car for two years before it
offsets the CO2 emitted while digging up, preparing its lithium. And
that's just the lithium. 

---

Natgas emissions 400 g CO2 / kWh. After 95% capture (which can
actually go even higher for natgas) the result is 20 g CO2 / kwh which
makes it nearly twice better than solar panels.

---

How to compare CO2 emissions from solar (yes there is some) vs fossil taking
into account the entire lifetime? [This paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00439.x)
puts that value at around 55 g / kwh thorughout the lifetime of a solar panel
(there is massive carbon emitted while producing the panel).

For coal that value is 1011 g CO2 / kWh. But once CCS is factored in,
assuming 95% is captured, lifetime emission of coal falls to 50 g /
kwh. Meaning, coal + CCS is cleaner than solar panels.

Davis: "[In Ukraine] Most Likely Scenario (Collapse of Western
Support).. Without remarkable levels of financial and military support
from Western countries, Russia might well have conquered far more
territory, and far faster, than it already has. Moscow might have even
forced an end-of-war settlement on Kyiv by now...

Most Western countries have a reflexive opposition to Russia. They
regard Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine with a combination of anger, fear,
and for some, hatred. All Western governments believe that Moscow’s
invasion was illegal and unjustified, and they want Putin to fail. But
each nation is also primarily concerned about its own national
security and interests. That self-interest balances their desire for
Russian failure. They do not want their support to cross a line and
draw them into conflict with Russia...

An additional and often overlooked factor is that some Western
governments view the threat of a conventional attack from Moscow to be
negligible. They have given minimal support – enough to be seen as
“doing something,” yet not enough to risk harming their own militaries
or their own economies, or to risk being dragged into the conflict
themselves...

Already the economies of the West are showing signs that a recession
is coming. In part as a result of massive sanctions levied on Russia,
gasoline prices have risen to historic highs, global food supplies
have risen to near crisis-levels (raising the price of nearly all
groceries), and inflation in the U.S. and UK remains at a four-decade
high. But the gas situation in Europe may prove to be the trigger for
a retrenchment of Western support to Ukraine..

The populations of Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and other Western
European nations, however, recognize there is effectively *no*
conventional threat to them from Moscow. Why, they will begin asking
with increasing stridency, should they sacrifice their own economic
security, struggle to put food on their tables, and scramble to heat
their homes during winter so that their governments can support
Ukraine in a war that is not necessary for European security?..

Take Germany. Their numerous *Mittelstand* the small-to-mid size

(or euros). Further innovation builds on top of this diversity, if you
want to build a clean-fuel combustion engine, chances are you will
find the parts, the know-how associated with the subcomponents of that
engine.

Davis: "It would take a country the size of Ukraine the better part of

recover from the devastation the Ukraine military has already
suffered. The idea that the UAF – or the armed forces of any nation on
earth – can recover from the level of destruction they’ve suffered to
date and rebuild the strength necessary to drive an invader out while
at the same time fighting an existential battle, is flatly
unrealistic.

Russia continues to take severe losses itself. Putin’s forces are not
immune to the consequences of losing trained and experienced
personnel, but as previously noted, Russia has millions more men from
which to draw new conscripts and hundreds of thousands of other active
troops that can be repurposed to ground combat. It is by no means
guaranteed that Russia would be able to achieve total victory over
Ukraine, but the fundamentals are present to give the idea some chance
of success. For Ukraine, however, there is minuscule chance of winning
and a higher probability of failure if they try to launch an
offensive.

An unemotional assessment of this war would lead to the conclusion
that the Ukrainian political leadership should seek the
best-negotiated settlement it could get now, while it still has
complete control of Kharkiv, Odesa, and most of Donetsk Oblast – and
before another significant city is turned to rubble and tens of
thousands more of its citizens killed or wounded"

Al Jazeera: "Hungary’s Orban says EU sanctions on Russia have
failed.. 'A new strategy is needed which should focus peace talks and
drafting a good peace proposal … instead of winning the war,' Orban
said in a speech in Romania on Saturday... Orban said this strategy
has failed as governments in Europe are collapsing 'like dominoes',
energy prices have surged and a new strategy was needed now. He said
Ukraine will never win the war this way 'quite simply because the
Russian army has assymetrical dominance'.

Orban called for Russia and the United States to hold negotiations to
bring about an end to the war... He said 'only Russian-US talks can
put an end to the conflict because Russia wants security guarantees'
only Washington can give"

"[T]hrough gasification (H2 + CO), then water gas shift
(H2O + CO --> H2 + CO2) so then what you have at the end is H2 + CO2.
You can either capture the CO2 with an amine leaving H2 with some CO2 in it,
or you use pressure swing adsorption to capture H2 at high purity, leaving
CO2 with H2 in it"

I dont think that's true... Checking the BP file

"Germany generates half of its energy through renewables"

---

Producer can send clean fuel over pipes, if natgas is sent it is
converted at the receiving end.

Ammonia is sent via ship, if LNG is used, a plant at the port does the
conversion. #H2

---

In terms of clean energy transition (not necessarily exclusively
renewables based) priority-wise my vote is going gung-ho on blue
H2 + CCUS. Let's convert every bit of CH4 (natgas) into H2
whereever possible.

The new CEO is somewhat less for electrification (good), talks abt

synthetic fuels which use carbon through budgeting schemes that makes

"Whereas the pizza sauce I lazily pick up from Trader Joe’s
refrigerator section [is..] loaded with spices, the pizzas in Italy
had very fresh tasting sauce, without much else in them. Could it
really as simple as using crushed tomatoes alone? After a bit more
research, I found that my suspicion was correct"

H2 Central: "[T]he Wyoming Energy Authority has released a roadmap
that outlines the path to building a hydrogen economy in the state...
'Hydrogen’s role as a decarbonized energy carrier with unprecedented
transportation and consumption utility makes this a truly
transformational opportunity for the entire state.'

Hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks – including
coal, natural gas, wind and even nuclear power – bringing the
potential to help sustain the wide variety of Wyoming’s abundant
natural reserves. In addition, hydrogen’s flexible structure can be
converted and transported in various ways, allowing Wyoming to utilize
its existing infrastructure, including an extensive natural gas
transmission system.

Hydrogen can also be added to existing raw low-value energy sources to
significantly increase the resiliency of Wyoming’s value chain and
provide processing opportunities within the state"

---

H2 Central: "While scaling up the production of electrolyser systems is paramount,
the importance of how green hydrogen will be transported cannot be
overstated...

For distances below 1,500km, transporting hydrogen as a gas via
pipeline is “generally the cheapest delivery option”; above 1,500km,
shipping hydrogen as ammonia or an LOHC may be more cost-effective, it
said, citing data from the International Energy Agency’s ‘The Future
of hydrogen – Seizing today’s opportunities’ report"

Baba Vanga predictions.. "a psycic seer" who died 1996.. Two of the
2022 predictions came true apparently, floods and drought. Now let's
assume this psycic truly had some skill, some wires crossed in the
"simulation" and information is leaking and that is what's being
reported...

But the predictions are still open to interpretation. Like one that
said "the Russian city of Kursk would be covered with water and the
whole world will weep over it".  Nothing happened to the city, but the
the Kursk *submarine* sank and 118 military personnel died. So a name
and a general nationality was right, the sinking, the scale is
completely off. How do we treat other predictions now? One mentions
alien invasion, does that simply mean alien signals being confirmed,
or outright invasion? We don't know.

Davis: "Bucking Basic (Western) Beliefs: Ukraine is in far worse shape
than portrayed – Ukrainian officials claim their forces are ready to
launch a “million-man offensive” against Russian forces next month,
while retired U.S. generals talk confidently about the war ending on
Ukraine’s terms by the end of this year. But an unemotional and
realistic assessment of the war’s most likely trajectory paints a
different picture...

Ukraine War Scenario Two: Russian Capture of Kharkiv & Odessa.. 

If Kharkiv falls, Ukraine will have even fewer troops left with which
to defend Odessa. If Russia were to mobilize enough men, it is
conceivable that they could invest Odessa even before Kharkiv was
completely captured. But whether simultaneously or sequentially, if
Russia moved on Odessa they would almost certainly employ the same
strategy they’ve used countless times already in this war, surround
the city, cut off its defenders, and then crush the city with
saturating firepower.

If Russia were to successfully take both Kharkiv and Odessa (after
having taken the Donbas before), then Russia would essentially be in
control of all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River. .. Once the
fighting gets to that point, however, Ukraine will have effectively
lost the war. The chances of it ever regaining any lost territories
would be virtually nil"
