H2 View: "In a bid to secure US Department of Energy (DOE) funding for
the development of a hydrogen hub, the West Virginia Hydrogen Hub
Coalition has officially submitted its proposal. The state becomes one
of the first to officially submit a proposal with the Mountain State’s
abundance of renewable energy set to be coupled for mass hydrogen
production and the integration of several end applications to boost
the hydrogen economy..

West Virginia already has a rich background in coal, gas and oil and
thus could have an extensive list of potential hydrogen customers that
can be utilised to surge demand for the clean energy carrier. Another
important factor is the availability of skill energy workforce and
with West Virginia’s already established energy sector, the jobs could
transition to hydrogen and support the emerging technologies and
wprojects.

US Senator Joe Manchin, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said, 'With our abundant energy sources and
strong partnerships, our state is uniquely situated to compete to
develop a hydrogen hub..'"

Salt caverns, and lined rock caverns.. There is a third method, using
pipeline pieces, underground..  We know a pipeline network itself is
also a storage mechanism, well, why not use pieces of pipeline
hardware and stack them on top of eachother underground, creating an
uber storage system?

---

Here is another method

CNBC: "[2020] Caverns can be created in salt domes by drilling into
the salt dome and injecting the rock with water, which dissolves the
salt. The resulting brine is extracted, leaving a large cavity. The
next step is storing hydrogen in the cavern...

'[One] formation has the potential to create up to 100 caverns, each
one capable of holding 150,000 MWh of energy,' says Browning [CEO of
Mitsubishi Power US, now at Fortesque]. 'It would take 40,000 shipping
containers of batteries to store that much energy in each cavern.'"

26.7 million dollars for 100 m3 storage. At 250 bars H2 has energy
density is 700 kwh/m3, this is 70 MWh of storage. It's pretty cheap.
The equivalent lion battery install would cost over $50 million.

Daily Scandanavian: "Hydrogen Storage Facility in Sweden Has Reached
Halfway Point in Construction..  Construction of the 100-cubic-meter..
rock cavern storage facility 30 meters below ground is done by
Vattenfall AB in collaboration with Swedish steel company SSAB AB..,
iron ore miner Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB..  The three owners
invested around USD 21.4m.. in three equal parts, with the Swedish
Energy Agency contributing just over SEK 52 million towards the
hydrogen storage construction.

The cavern is being built via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC)
approach, which involves covering the walls of the cavern with a
selected matter. The technology for storing gas in a lined rock cavern
(LRC) is well proven and has been used in southern Sweden for about 20
years for storing natural gas. However, the technology is now taking
another step forward as it’s being developed for the first time with
hydrogen gas on a large pilot scale... The finished plant will contain
hydrogen gas pressurized up to 250 bar"

H2 View: "Green hydrogen prize is huge for Middle East if strategic
hub approach is adopted.. Momentum is building to scale up green
hydrogen production in the Middle East..  to support industrial
decarbonisation and create a new export economy..

The UAE’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure chose COP26 in Glasgow
as the launchpad for its Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap. And earlier this
month one of its senior officials said hydrogen will be ‘crucial to
decarbonise industries, transportation, and the fossil fuel sector.”..

There is clear evidence across the region of buy-in to hydrogen’s
potential, epitomised by Saudi Arabia’s stated aim of becoming a
leading global supplier of hydrogen. Plans are already in motion for a
multi-billion dollar production plant in the country’s north western
region, with a daily production target of 650 tonnes of green
hydrogen, planned to be on stream by 2026"

WION: "EU aims to form a rapid reaction force.. US-led military
alliance NATO has for decades provided the bedrock for European
defence and the war in Ukraine has reinforced the instinct among many
EU members to keep Washington close.. But there has also been a push
led by France for the bloc to bolster its own capacity to act. The new
strategy is designed to strike that balancing act while boosting
defence cooperation between EU states"

---

Daily Mail: "Missile attack on Ukrainian military base launched after
Russian troops hacked into British phones.. As a result, Kremlin
agents were able to confirm the presence of former British servicemen
on the massive base — and choose which buildings to hit"

---

The uber-antagonism backfired. Russians are now gunning for your ass,
in a recent UKR attack they specifically chose buildings so they could
smoke out Brits. See above.

---

Remember the July 2021 [event](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/world/europe/russia-uk-destroyer-crimea.html).
It was just bizarre.. 

Kinda like [this move](twimg/FOY3EccX0AQuQqa.jpg).

But Putin isn't impressed, guy doesn't f--k around.

---

UK was part of the inners (the EU), but left it due to a stupid choice
(that's what you get when you ask 'people' on policy) and naturally
became part of the 'outer belt'. The recent Johnson
[comment](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60809454) on UKR/Brexit
makes this clear; in the Brexiter mind these two issues are linked,
not in the way BJ expressed obviously, but in a larger sense,
exclusively being in that alliance forced them to be a "good soldier",
extremely pro-Ukraine, antagonistic against RU which was unavoidable
after Brexit.

---

Japan has been the ultimate "money guy" for the group. They picked up
the tab for the entire Iraq war effort (the first one).

---

Japan after giving up on its imperial ambitions became a pacified part
of the 'outers'. They are a recent addition to the Five Eyes network
too actually (I guess now the org is Six Eyes).

---

Wapo: "[After little job-well-done, pat in the back, the inevitable
'but' arrives here] Finally, the Western democracies need to think about
how the war ends. While the ideal outcome would be a complete defeat
for Putin and a humiliating withdrawal of all his forces from Ukraine,
that appears unlikely — especially given the nuclear arsenal with
which Russia can in effect blackmail the world.

Here the lesson of the Russo-Finnish War is that a diplomatic
compromise may be necessary. Ukraine may have to provide a guarantee
of neutrality and agree to give up some of the territory that is
already de facto in the hands of Russia: Crimea and the Donbas region
in the east"

RU is a weapons exporter would not have urgent need for weapons from

RU invades UKR, an outer outpost on its border, the most fervent
denials come from US, UK, Oz. Distance-wise these countries are far,
far away, the feverishness of the protest makes no sense; but from a
larger view it does.

---

France has been active on the high-seas, a seafaring nation, but its
history and strategic needs is too tied to the greater Eurasian
landmass, so it mostly behaves like an inner. That is why FR is never
accepted to "the club", the "Five Eyes"; see the recent AUKUS debacle.
They didn't just kick out France, they reveled in it.

---

It might make sense to look at the broad IR landscape through a inner
vs belter (outer) lens, using terminology of *The Expanse*. China,
Russia, Europe are the "inners", US, Oz, UK the outers. Outers want
the inners to stay where they are, contained. 

---

Interesting to note during WWII when Japan was attacking Soviets, and
China, the US was fine with that. After the northward attack stalled
though, and Japan changed focus to the south, the islands, then US put
sanctions on Japan cutting its oil (which triggered a Japanese gamble
on Pearl Harbor to cripple US while it could take all those resources,
US responded).

But US priority was clear, attack the land-based powers, keep them
locked in their places, that's fine.. If you try to be a naval power
yourself, you are in trouble. When Japan tried that it was nuked,
firebombed into submission.

Devine, *Laptop from Hell*: "Five days after Costello’s late-night
call, on Wednesday, October 14, 2020, the *New York Post* published
the first of a series of front-page bombshells,.. culled from the
contents of Hunter’s laptop. The story, headlined 'Biden’s Secret
Emails,' revealed a bombshell 2015 email indicating that Joe, as vice
president, had met in Washington with a high-ranking representative of
the corrupt Ukrainian energy company that was paying his junkie son a
million dollars a year to sit on its board. Eight months after the
meeting, Joe flew to Kyiv and threatened to withhold $1 billion in US
aid unless the Ukrainian government fired its top prosecutor, Viktor
Shokin, who was pursuing Burisma for corruption at the time. The email
was news, in anyone’s language.

But soon after the Post’s story broke online, social media censored
it. Facebook announced it had throttled the story’s reach. Twitter
locked the Post’s account for two weeks, then admitted after the
election that it had made a mistake. It was a chilling exercise of raw
political power by an unaccountable Big Tech—the term given to the
oligopoly of global corporations that dominate the information
technology industry.

The coordinated censorship of America’s oldest newspaper, with the
fourth largest circulation in the nation, amounted to election
interference. It was a historic moment that rang alarm bells around
the world and would harden resolve on Capitol Hill to rein in the
power of the social media giants"

---

Even some in the establishment must have seen the current state of
play in UKR is no good, largely US's fault. The Hunter Biden thing
resurfacing might be a message to WH..  The HB expose is key bcz it
has the word 'Ukraine' written all over it.

F24: "Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky made a fresh appeal for
meaningful talks with Moscow on Saturday to end the war as Russia said

---

Various end results for UKR-RU are possible .. One assesment I saw
claimed RU will take everything east of the Dnipro river; i.e. all of
Eastern Ukraine. UKR is close in culture to Russians, but the East is
even more so.. Then maybe RU is feeling out how things develop, doing
a little head fake on the North, but invading strongly from Southeast,
and if no agreement is forthcoming, no substantial concessions in tune
of what they wanted, they'll just take Eastern Ukraine and call it a
day.

Combined geographically w previously acquired regions, the whole block
actually makes sense, there is a geographical boundary between East
and West anyway, a river, and it connects nicely with the 'seperatist'
regions, plus Crimea. RU's needed 'buffer' will get bigger, and the
remaining gov in the West will probably not utter the word NATO ever
again.

---

Today India and Russia need eachother in case of a resurgent China and
China needs Russia against what they view as a overly meddling
West. So I dont think "the Quad", or any other pact can override the
India-Russia relationship.

Whether it’s describing Saddam Hussein as a 'madman,' Gaddafi as

political objectives by simplifying any conflict into a clear binary
of 'good' versus 'evil'... The Israeli state often indulges in such

Such framing is now being tactfully employed to
