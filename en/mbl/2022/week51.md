MD can scale both ways; either through seperate name groups / blocks,
or internally for each block adding extra hardware. Twitter, Facebook
can only scale internally, which makes them monolithic,
architecturally lacking.

---

BTW when ppl speak of "adding Mastadon servers" they usually mean a
new name, a new URL. But technically speaking that name, that access
point could also be scaled internally by adding "more physical server
machines", same way netflix.com can be scaled behind the scenes, user
is rerouted to a cluster of machines in the background.

The bit about a lawyer being stopped from entering a music hall in the
US because its facial recognition system picked up that she's part of
a law company that's suing them is even crazier than I thought. The
law company isn't suing the music hall - it's suing a restaurant, in
another state, which is owned by the hall's parent company MSG
Entertainment. MSG gone ahead and harvested photos of all the lawyers
in the firm and fed it to an image recognition system to ban them from
every MSG Entertainment owned location"

Sagan quote reminds me of people who are conned into battery-electric

Carl Sagan: "One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve
been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the
bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The
bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge,
even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken"

There is a [pic](twimg/FkfEieXWYAEMoAy.jpg) too...
Evolution is wild.

LA Times: In Alaska, wood frogs freeze for seven months, thaw and hop
away.. Each September, the wood frogs of Alaska do a very strange
thing: They freeze. They do not freeze totally solid, but they do
freeze mostly solid. Two-thirds of their body water turns to ice. If
you picked them up, they would not move. If you bent one of their
legs, it would break.

Inside these frozen frogs other weird physiological things are going
on. Their hearts stop beating, their blood no longer flows and their
glucose levels sky rocket.

“On an organismal level they are essentially dead,” said Don Larson, a
graduate student at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks who studies
frogs. “The individual cells are still functioning, but they have no
way to communicate with each other.”

The craziest thing of all may be that in this frozen state, they can
withstand temperatures as low as zero degrees Fahrenheit for as long
as seven months, and then, when spring arrives, thaw out and hop away.

Also let's consider the extra burden HPs will bring on the grid -
which is a fragile system to begin with. A clean gas pipeline would be
much more robust, scalable. Pipes can deliver energy 10 times faster
compared to the grid.

"Before.. heat pump went in, we were paying £250 a month in oil..
January had a lot of really icy days and it’s been the longest
sustained bout of cold weather we’ve experienced since moving in. Last
month, we consumed 2,231 kWh of electricity electricity, just for the
air source heat pump, which is a crazy amount at around 72kWh per day"

[[-]](https://myhomefarm.co.uk/potential-air-source-heat-pump-running-cost-issue)

---

I see some efficiency numbers for heat pumps that are plain
non-sense. I'd look at how much extra is paid after HP is installed, a
simple before/after comparison.

---

Heat pumps cannot power stoves - but H2 piped into homes can provide
both heating and help with cooking. Heating is extremely power hungry
and work best through molecules, fuels; currently natgas, LPG,
hopefully later clean fuels.

hydrogen, and finally ammonia itself can be used in turbines to

AFR Map - Added Western Sahara, Central African Republic, and Tunisia - 
"a major non-NATO ally". TUN is surely not enjoying the pressure it

now sides with it against Morocco (see item 21/2).

This is a real problem with "AI" -the current reincarnation of neural
networks with gazillions of free parameters-.

Paper: "We surmise silent bugs are especially insidious in [deep
learning] libraries and applications built on top of them. The primary
reason is that DL applications.. belong to the family of 'non-testable
program', for which, strictly speaking, oracles do not
exist. Moreover, finding such bugs in DL libraries can be very hard
and tedious. A DL model developed by a user typically consists of many
floating point parameters and operations (up to billions). Even with a
few bugs, the model may still be created, trained, and appeared to
work...  While there are various explanations for an unexpected
behaviour that need to be ruled out, the worst is the fact that the
faulty computation is not explicitly developed by the user, but
implicitly produced by the library. However, little information can be
obtained from the DL model’s internal mechanism and training/inference
due to the 'black-box' and stochastic nature of DL
training/inference. Hence, any bugs in DL libraries may lead to bugs
in the user’s program that the user might not, easily, become aware
of"

HTGR nuclear plants (see Japan, RU) don't have to be near the sea;

The CEIP article below seems to downplay the rise of terror attacks in

in 2016". I checked GTD (all incidents, all deaths, monthly, ends
2020-06), there is a spike. I'd call the increases significant. Since
2016 numbers went down now they are lower. See [post](../../2023/01/confstats.html#gtdafrica).
