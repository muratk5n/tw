Don't have suitable salt cavern location for H2 storage? [Pipe storage](../../2022/02/h2-underground.html#pipe)
is possible, feasible, cheap.

---

Vacancy rate, the number of job openings per unemployed which shows
"labor market tightness" is through the roof. The great resignation
might have had an effect here.

"@blackpillreport

Alex Jones gets [a] thing wrong.. apologizes dozens of times, and he
has to pay $4M via court order. MSM deliberately lies every day, yet
no court orders to pay anyone anything"

That is a good campaign jab

legend, musician-actor Steven Van Zandt, telling Oz.. 'What are you
doing in Pennsylvania? Everybody knows you live in New Jersey..  come

Excellent.

Long-ass numbers. To pick something out of a list (song, video) take
mod (divide, use remainder) by number of items, that's your random
item picker.

---

Says 'find an output that is transient'; I guess the output of a Unix
process list is pretty transient - new programs get created,
destroyed, their uptime, ordering can change that changes the output,
which will give a near-random looking digest.

---

Unix book suggests take output of `ps gaux` generate a digest (single
number) from it.. Good idea

---

Random num generator not looking good.. I started noticing repeats on
my jukebox. New one is needed.

---

If international institutions had muscle and foresight coulda preempt
some of this - but now navies are patroling the area, there can be a
nice little war one day with gazillions of interests at risk.

---

According to 1923 Lausanne Treaty the islands near Asia Minor were
supposed to be demilitarized. This rule has not been followed by
Greece. 

---

Now here's some crazier stuff; TR/US rel soured. Russkie has access to
EastMed (through Syria) and soon perhaps most of northern Black Sea
EEZ. A confluence of interest occured, TR can increase RU rel, provide
transit to RU exports, and buy more military hardware from Russia, and
in return receive some naval RU help in the EastMed.  TR/RU on one
side, Greece, Egypt, Israel, (EU?) on the other.

---

Planned EastMed pipeline, first found problematic (by US/EU now back
in play due to problems with Russian gas) goes right through
disputed areas

---

Greece and Egypt have a counter-agreement that contradicts Libya-TR,
it's a big "EEZ off".

---

That's why the so-called "Blue Homeland" EEZ was enacted unilaterally
since 2013, and is now being followed. The corridor with Libya was
agreed upon based on this EEZ.

---

The problem between Greece and Asia Minor is Greece has too many
islands close to AM restricting its access - combined with Cyprus
(the whole of which is still considered Greek) the EEZs become massive.
That ain't fair for homie.

12 nautical miles off coast is territorial waters.

200 nautical miles is EEZ (exclusive econ zone, rights for
exploitation of resources).

If EEZ of two countries overlap, a line is drawn in the middle
usually. Example Sri Lanka and India [here](twimg/FZf0YjmXoAYKHEh.png).

:) Good one.. But that too isn't exactly original (see 2019 news [item](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/vladimir-putin-russia-body-double-17083215))
