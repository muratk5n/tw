<p>Lockdown parties.. bad bad. Britain's culture code for itself is
CLASS. By ignoring the rules BJ said "I'm above you" (reaches emo
brain, very powerful). It's particularly damaging for BJ bcz his whole
shtick was being "against the elites". "Elites" wanted Bremain,
"people" needed Brexit. Cameron looked like an "elite", BJ was the
pudgy, everyman looking guy (both grads of Eton but ssshhh), so when
BJ did the elite thing, it became 10 times more damaging.</p>
<hr />
<p>The new off kilter ideology backdrop cld also be partly why UK BJ was
too gung-ho on Russia (even before the war); conservatives are
generally hawkish, well, this was one 'conservative' thing he could
still do..</p>
<hr />
<p>Politics in some Western countries are off-kilter.. During the UK
trucker shortages I actually heard PM BJ say "well if there are
shortages, maybe businesses should pay better wages". A Tory
PM. Asking higher wages. It's like someone said the moon is made of
cheese, or I walked to school and back, up the hill both ways..

<p>The claim is BW III will be based on a new commodity based Asian
currency - replacing the dollar-based system.</p>
<p>Pozsar: "If we are right, and if this is a “crisis of commodities” – a
2008 of sorts thematically, if not in terms of size or severity – who
will provide the backstop?  We see but only one entity: the PBoC!
Western central banks cannot close the gaping “commodities basis”
because their respective sovereigns are the ones driving the
sanctions. They will have to deal with the inflationary impacts of the
“commodities basis” and try to cool them with rate hikes, but they
will not be able to provide the outside spreads and won’t be able to
provide balance sheet to close “Russia-non-Russia” spreads.  Commodity
traders won’t be able to either. Remember that Glencore rose from the
ashes of Marc Rich + Co, and with Switzerland along with the
sanctions, Swiss-based commodity traders will think twice about
arbitraging the spreads.</p>
<p>But the PBoC [Chinese Central Bank] can…</p>
<p>.. as it banks for a sovereign who can dance to its own tune. To make
things more complicated, China is probably thinking deep and hard
about the value of the inside money claims in its FX reserves, now
that the G7 seized Russia’s...</p>
<p>The Fed and other central banks will be able to provide liquidity
backstops.. .. but those will be Band-Aid solutions. The true problem
here is not liquidity per se. Liquidity is just a manifestation of a
larger problem, which is the Russian-non-Russian commodities basis,
which only China will be able to close"</p>
<hr />
<p>Pozsar: "[I]f you believe that the West can craft sanctions that
maximize pain for Russia while minimizing financial stability risks
and price stability risks in the West, you could also believe in
unicorns"</p>
<hr />
<p>By CC=1 he means individual commodity prices are going up and down in
sync.</p>
<p>Pozsar: "Commodity correlations are also at 1, which, to stress, is
never a good thing. But that’s precisely what happens when the West
sanctions the single-largest commodity producer of the world, which
sells virtually everything..</p>
<p>The commodities market is much more financialized and
leveraged today than it was during the 1973 OPEC supply crisis, and
today’s Russian supply crisis is much bigger, much more broad-based,
and much more correlated. It’s scarier"</p>
