Euractiv: "Germany’s Scholz rallies G7 countries behind ‘climate club’
idea..

It will be built on three policies. Firstly, ambitious climate
“mitigation” policies to reduce emission intensities of participating
economies where members share best practices and work towards a common
understanding of the economic impacts of “mitigation” policies, such
as through explicit carbon pricing.

A second pillar will be the joint transformation of industry through
the industrial decarbonisation agenda, the hydrogen action pact and by
expanding markets for green industrial products, which often struggle
to compete on price with their more polluting fossil competitors.

The climate club’s third pillar will be partnerships and cooperation,
with the statement highlighting the “Just Energy Transition
Partnerships” (JETPs), which are schemes tailored to countries like
South Africa or India. Countries will receive financial support and
technology transfers depending on their level of climate ambition
through these JETPs"

The Apollo missions were not dumb tries; had clear goals (Lyndon
Johnson knew his shit).

Kennedy just made that one speech, "we go to the Moon because I'm
haahd"..  that's it. The idea was LBJ's. Clear goal backed with
know-how.

---

Electrification goal: another dumb try. There isn't enough lithium in
the world. The electric grid is inefficient and will always be so; the
base science is screwed up. Can't "tinker", "take a chance" your way
out of this problem.

---

A lot about US is about "dumb tries". You win by trying a lot, and
hopefully 'striking gold'. That approach might be reaching the end of
its usefulness. The culture likely formed while exploring the "new
lands", all you needed was courage, a push, enough for you to start
the journey, the rest would be adventure and hopefully a lot of gains.

But tinkering with a dangerous virus gave us covid. Stupid courage can
push you to Mars, but will also kill you there. Crossing the Atlantic
to reach new lands was different type of experimentation.. There was
still land, air, the downside for failure actually wasn't too high.

"The key cornerstone of U.S. and NATO methodology is maneuver
warfare. Maneuver warfare depends on communication and synchronization
of assets. The U.S. has communication infrastructure down to the four
man Infantry Fire Team level and the ability to battle track those
formations with almost real-time speed. When everything functions as
designed, these smaller formations can achieve much larger effects
than their Russian equivalent..

Because of maneuver warfare’s reliance on communication, Russia has
invested heavily in Electronic Warfare systems which are capable of
shutting down communications and signals across a broad spectrum"

Nationalists gaslight. Asia Minor relation to the seas could simply be

have to come up with some bed time story about a "migrant" who is

point- was useful (it isn't even useful anymore, on top of being a
blatant lie).

---

Romans were always a land-centric force, they saw the sea as a way to
transport land troops for subsequent land invasion. When they used the
sea they tried to invent mechanisms to merely complement their land
strength, sometimes in bizarre ways. One invention was a huge landing
platform bolted in the middle of the ship, plan was to pull it down
during ship-to-ship conflict on top of the other ship so regular
legionaires can rush over there and do legionaire shit.. But the
mechanism wasn't designed well it screwed up the balance of the ships,
they routinely sank.

---

There was one Greek ship in the 1900s Georgios Averof that caused huge
damage on the entire Otto navy, allowing Greeks to take more Aegean
islands. That wasn't because Greeks "like the sea more", that ship
used British guns and French boilers. Ship was made in Italy but Italy
too had fallen behind in its sea control comparatively speaking. So
much so that when Hitler made an alliance with fascist Italy the
alliance wasn't seen to have brought more reach for either of them; a
land power allied with another land power.

Anatolia isn't averse to the seas, no more or less than other Medi

think "OMG US is leaving" along with "OMG Tali is coming in". That was
their goal and they succeeded. Of course it looked bad for US, it
sucked. But on the whole these people are poor, live out of shoddy
shacks with a few sheep

could more profitable simply to follow. But US errs, and in past few
decades errs big. The dream machine is generating too much junk, tech

Just because something has "electric", "electromagnetic" in its name

Foreign Policy: "[Gabbard, Davis] As much as Ukraine welcomes every
piece of equipment, however, the deliveries have been a clunky mixture
of modern and antiquated, Western and Soviet. Numerous systems require
specialized training, specific maintenance systems, and ammunition of
various calibers that are often mutually exclusive to each weapon
system. All of this requires a massive and complicated logistics
system to keep the weapons supplied and functioning—one that doesn’t
currently exist in Ukraine and continues to be improvised...

Policies in Kyiv and Washington seem to ignore these battlefield
realities... While there is still time, and Kyiv still controls 80
percent of its territory, a change in U.S. policy would provide a
chance to save Ukrainian lives and prevent further territorial
losses. At minimum, the Biden administration should de-emphasize
its goals of weakening Russia and instead prioritize diplomacy,
helping Kyiv and Moscow find a negotiated end to the war"

inflation, low growth, and high unemployment all at the same
time. This happened in the 1970s, but it isn’t happening now—or at
least, it isn’t happening yet—and it’s one reason treating 2022 as if
it’s 1979 doesn’t make much sense.Let’s also admit an obvious
political reality about the expectations of the American voter: Many
of the people who are fed up with inflation in 2022 are angry mostly
because until about a year ago, they’d never actually experienced
it. Yes, it’s been a rough year, but in 1979 Americans were despairing
because high inflation had already been around for several
years. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Carter all tussled with it. We
tried everything from wage and price controls to 'Whip inflation now'
sloganeering—as if consumers could join the fight by wearing
buttons.The same is true of interest rates. Today’s younger consumers
may be shocked that mortgages are breaking 6 percent—but again, this
is because they have become accustomed to ridiculously low rates. Even
50 years ago, the average rates were about 7 percent; they’ve been
lower than that for two decades now"

You got your answer didn't you, Focker.

You are not in the circle of trust anymore 👌

US libertarian right there.

NYT: "[Peter Thiel interview, 2017] It’s like, even if you appointed a
whole series of conservative Supreme Court justices, I’m not sure that
Roe v. Wade would get overturned.. I don’t know if people even care
about the Supreme Court"

German libertarians supported ending the ban - because of, you know,
liberty.

NYT: "Germany Ends Ban on Abortion Advertisement.. The vote to scrap
the law came on the same day that Roe v. Wade was overturned by the
U.S. Supreme Court.

Lawmakers voted on Friday to end a Nazi-era ban on the advertisement
of abortion services, a measure that had effectively criminalized
doctors who provided information about the procedure.The law, though
ignored for years, had recently prompted several high-profile legal
cases against doctors. That, in turn, led to a sustained campaign by
abortion-rights activists for repeal of the advertising ban, which
Germany’s relatively new government had made a goal"

Manchin: "I trusted Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh when they
testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled
legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability
the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans."

And now they will say 'vote for us to bring back Roe'; the culture war
dividend never ends.

"@JeffreyStClair3

The leadership of the Democratic Party, which for 20 years has said
the only reason to vote for them is to protect Roe, should resign en
masse. Their failure is absolute"

IOW how to do incremental fixes on an incremental fix which itself
wasn't good enough to begin with.. Reminds me of battery electric
cars as a "green solution".

RU had 10 times more artillery attacks for that day than UKR

Code sifts through RU, UKR media sources, and pulls out relevant info
automagically using "high dimensional ad-hoc nonlinear statistics"
sometimes called machine learning, but these days usually mistakenly
called "AI".

Washington Examier: "After a month of holding out, the Ukrainian high
command ordered the remaining defenders in Severodonetsk, the
administrative capital of Luhansk, to beat a tactical retreat out of
the city and fortify their defenses in Lysychansk, the sister city to
the west of the Seversky Donets River. 'Remaining in positions smashed
to pieces over many months just for the sake of staying there does not
make sense,' Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said...

Russian forces were making slow progress in the Severodonetsk pocket
for weeks, using their advantage in artillery to pummel everything in
their path before sending ground forces into the area. Russia’s war
plan, to put it in the most unsophisticated way possible, was to
overwhelm the Ukrainian defenders with constant bombardment until they
relented. For Ukraine, the only other alternative would have been to
stick around and risk total encirclement — a strategy that would have
been indefensible, if not insane, when the Ukrainian military is
already losing perhaps 200 soldiers a day"
