<p>NH3 is still useful as energy vector, it can be combusted in a turbine
(Japan Mitsubishi has the tech), used for carrier for other kinds of
fuel-cells.</p>
<hr />
<p>That must be why ammonia company GenCell tout alkaline fuel-cells, the
tech works even with non high-purity H2, as opposed to PEM which needs
high-purity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ammoniaenergy.org/articles/gencell-launches-commercial-alkaline-fuel-cell-using-cracked-ammonia-fuel/">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Looking at the PE presentation again; they are especially focused on
compression, bcz apparently getting high-purity H2 is easiest that
way. Ammonia can carry huge amounts of H2, but getting high purity is
tough. From pg 10,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compression is integral to all three supply chains to increase the
volumetric energy density of H2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compression has minimal technical barriers..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LH2 [liquid form] supply chain is significantly more complex with
additional energy intensive processes as well as onshore storage
requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NH3 involves mature and well-developed technologies. However, if the
end user requires high purity hydrogen, then technical barriers and
energy penalty to crack and purify (reconversion)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>BTW the heating energy calc <a href="../../2022/01/heating-calculation-fourier.html">here</a> actually
takes energy used for cooling into account, indirectly; It calculates
the energy needed to raise (the average world temperature) from 13
to (room temperature) 22. Well, there are many temp levels
during the year that contribute to  that average. Sometimes it is -20,
sometimes 10, or 30. So by calculating 13-&gt;22 switch, we are
also calculating 40 to 22, for some places. </p>

<p>The Guardian: "But air conditioning and refrigeration are doubly
polluting: not only are they produced from climate-warming fossil
fuels, but the HFCs and other refrigerants cooling systems use produce
greenhouse gases that can be 4,000 times more potent than carbon
dioxide"</p>

<p>It is great Europe is creating the demand upfront, that can spur
companies to get their tech in order; Provaris CEO attended an H2 conf
and says the demand from EU is there, they want tons of this
stuff. Where there is demand, there will be supply.. so PE is building
tech for it. Enter the snowball effect; seeing supply, products will
arrive, which will create more supply. Only policy could start that

<p>Can work backwards from capacity to output. LNG replacement? Get ship
capacity, number of trips, or simply an annual export amount giving a
Gwh, now work backwards from there, divide by 365, then 24 - once we
have calc down to Watt-hour within an hour, we can drop the hour, get
Wattage.</p>
<hr />
<p>Converting energy numbers to a Wattage (kilo,giga) as in power input /
output helps to gauge how much of a power need can be met by existing
sources, and compare sources with eachother, no matter how long that
power would be needed (which takes us into Watt-hour, storage capacity
territory). A TV pulls in 60 Watts, an oven 1500 W. Russian NG export
to Europe is 167 Gigawatts (a lot of TVs can run on that
energy). Typical nuclear plant output is 1 GW, Fukushima (the one with
the meltdown) was 5 GW. Then it takes 33 Fukushimas to replace Russian
exports to Europe. Now in terms of environment policy that is probably
a non-starter.</p>

<p>Econ structure is a convoluted mess. Credit is given to companies who
use it to pay salaries to people. To increase salaries you have
increase credit. But there is no assurance that credit will go to
salaries, it can end up in the stock market. If money does go to
salaries, in excess, this can cause inflation which decreases the
benefit of that increase 🤦‍♂️ Also too much wage increase can hurt
company bottom line, then biz has to cut costs, fire people - now you

<p>Energy content, capacity is reported in kilowatt-hour or
gigawatt-hour; this is the amount of energy. Gigawatt (wout the hour)
is a rate, a flow of sorts; I lift a tons of water up, it has
potential stored energy (kwh, gwh). Poke a hole, water will flow out,

have 2 KWh of (potential) energy, if I poked a hole for 1 kilowatt

<p>Aquaventus: "In all three dimensions examined, offshore electrolysis
with pipeline connection emerges as the best approach: According to
the study, a pipeline for hydrogen generated offshore can be realized
up to five and a half years faster than submarine cable connections
for offshore electricity.. In addition, the investment would require
up to 6 billion euros less, reducing the production costs for green
hydrogen. From a permitting perspective and with a focus on
environmental protection, 610 kilometres of pipeline versus 3720
kilometres of high-voltage lines as well as the location of
electrolysis on the high seas also mean significant advantages in
terms of environmental impact"</p>

<p>"40% of the American public has less than a thousand dollars of savings

paycheck bought less and less they had a huge reverse wealth effect. I
think now FED policy is now oriented towards those 40 percent they
need to get inflation down.. Now we've got the politicians demanding
that they raise rates and raise rates aggressively to deal with
inflation because that 40 percent is behind" #JimBianco</p>

<p>Davis: "In the modern era of warfare, there are a few key factors that
almost always result in victory for the side that best employs
them. In this war, Russia has advantages over the Ukraine armed in
important categories that will be hard for the UAF to overcome. First
is a clear Russian command of the skies. Yes, as many have pointed
out, Russia was unable to completely knock out the Ukrainian air
defenses, but they have badly degraded them such that Russia is
routinely able to fly between 200 to 300 sorties per day.</p>
<p>About a month ago, there was much notoriety that Ukraine had gained
the use of 20 fighter jets owing to supply parts provided by the
West. Yet there has been no apparent increase in the number of
Ukrainian jets attacking Russian positions beyond the five to 10 per
day reported earlier in the war. The reason is clear: Russian air
defense capabilities remain fully in tact and employ modern S-400
systems that makes any attempt to fly by Ukrainian pilots a likely
death sentence. Ukrainian air defenses still exist, but were badly
degraded at the start of the war, and continue to be knocked out by
Russian attacks. These realities underscore how hard it would be for
Ukraine to reverse the momentum in the Donbas"</p>
