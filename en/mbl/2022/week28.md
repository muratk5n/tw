H2 Central: "Electrolyser capital costs have fallen from more than
$3,700 per kW in 2020 to about 2,700 dollar per kW today and will drop
to below 200 dollar per kW by 2050 under the agency’s most optimistic
scenario. Under its most pessimistic scenario, capital costs will
decline to about 800 dol per kW, national science agency CSIRO said in
its annual GenCost report.

The main driver of falling electrolyser costs will be scale as the
size of systems grows from an average of 10 MW today to 100 MW modular
units in the coming years, CSIRO said.

CSIRO, said: 'Applying typical engineering cost scaling factors this
movement to full scale accounts for around an 80% reduction in
costs'. Electrolyser deployment is being supported by a substantial
number of hydrogen supply and end- use trials globally and in
Australia.'"

Metal hydrides are very promising tech for storage, see Australian
company Lavo.

H2 View: "A Norwegian school is planned to become home to what is said
to be the world’s largest metal hydride-based hydrogen storage
facility. Hybrid Energy revealed on Tuesday (July 12), that its
daughter company Hystorsys had won a contract to install the hydrogen
storage at the Vestiden Junior Highschool in Kongsberg, Norway.

Hystorsys, a spin off from the Norwegian Institute for Energy
Technology (IFE), plans to install its storage solution at the school
to store excess energy produced by solar panels during the summer as
hydrogen, ready for winter consumption..

Hybrid Energy says its storage solution has the ability to store 1kg
of hydrogen in a 17-litre metal hydride unit at 30 bar, by comparison
to more traditional storage units offering 1kg in 42-litre units at
350 bar"

H2 Central: "Thyssengas is planning an 800-kilometer hydrogen launch
grid in Germany... The transmission system operator Thyssengas
currently operates a 4,400-kilometre-long transmission network, most
of which still transports natural gas. But that is about to change. In
the future, these pipelines will gradually be converted to hydrogen..

With the establishment of a “Thyssengas H2 start network” based on the
existing natural gas network, Thyssengas wants to underline its own
claim to be a pioneer and designer of the energy transition... [Its
CEO] sees the establishment of an H2 network based on existing natural
gas pipelines as a necessary lever and an important signal to
producers, importers and consumers in the Thyssengas grid area...

Thyssengas’ hydrogen grid planning is based on around 45 declarations
of intent (MoUs) that Thyssengas has concluded with potential hydrogen
producers and customers as part of a market survey conducted by FNB
Gas e.V., an association of supra-regional gas transport companies.

Over the 800 kilometres of pipeline identified, these future customers
are to be reliably supplied with hydrogen from 2030 at the
latest. These are lines that are to be successively rededicated for
hydrogen transport or rebuilt in parts"

It makes sense the right does not like teachers; they are the
personification of the dumb shitlib who doesn't know anything but
simply relays knowledge from some kind of 'authority' to the student
but thinks are always right because those authorities happen to be
secular -which of course is no guarantee for anything-.

---

I recommend, teachers, record your own lectures, and flip the
classroom. Next stage, flip the classroom around *someone else's
lecture*, students get quality that way if the teacher is a 'dud'.

---

The lack of focus on the latter part causes focus on the
former..

Alternative ed is not being discussed, so within the confines of
current system teacher quality would be the focus - that is the only
parameter that can be tuned.

On that, [some countries](../../2021/03/unrivaled-beckley.html#ed) do well,
but most others dont.. I don't think you can do Finland style ed
without being Finland. We need a scalable new approach.

The Mandarin: "Remember when former [Oz] Morrison government minister
Stuart Robert lashed out at 'dud' teachers? In March, the then-acting
education minister said the 'bottom 10%' of teachers 'can’t read and
write' and blamed them for declining academic results.. We are fixated
on 'teacher quality'.. My analysis found the focus on 'quality' was
far more on teachers than, say, teaching approaches, schools,
schooling, education systems or anything else"

FCHEA: "As more and more countries continue to use hydrogen, it’s
worth revisiting countries.. such as China and India...

China has been an early adopter of hydrogen, and many of its
previous laws and regulations called for the adoption of a hydrogen
economy. Recently however, the Chinese government published the first
official hydrogen plan for the country, designed to set specific
guidelines, and long-term growth targets for the hydrogen industry.
The plan covers a wide range of areas, from manufacturing, and
research capabilities, manufacturing targets, and specific goals for
hydrogen production and consumption... Overall, the central government
seeks to “significantly improve” the portion of clean hydrogen in use
across China by 2035. To do so, the government released some nearer
term targets to produce up to 200,000 tons of clean hydrogen.. In
addition to the central government, local governments and the private
sector are also getting involved in the clean hydrogen economy...

India has also begun to recognize clean hydrogen as essential to
decarbonization. The Indian government recently announced a “phase
one” document for clean hydrogen production, and released a set of
policies in early 2022. The policies include allowing clean hydrogen
producers to buy renewable energy at reduced rates, simplifying the
permitting and licensing process to prioritize clean hydrogen, and
allowing the construction of storage containers next to ports designed
for hydrogen. The government has also promised to waive inter-state
transmission charges for 25 years if the project is commissioned
before June 30, 2025. This would significantly reduce the cost of
clean hydrogen, potentially jumpstarting the hydrogen economy in
India. This is all part of the government’s effort to reduce carbon
emissions to zero by 2070. The government plans to release more
policies to encourage the use of hydrogen production, including
manufacturing zones dedicated to clean hydrogen"

Davis: "There Is No ‘Magic Bullet’ That Can Turn The Tide For
Ukraine... In some instances, fighting tenaciously in the face of
considerable enemy superiority can prove to be the difference between
victory and defeat. For example, in the famous Battle of the Bulge,
the U.S. 101st Airborne Division refused to surrender in Bastogne even
after it had been surrounded and cut off by the advancing German
army...

The U.S. commander, however, had good reason to hold on even against
an enemy with overwhelming numbers of artillery and tanks: as soon as
the fog and cloud cover broke, the U.S. commander could expect massive
air support to break the back of the German assaults and aerial
resupply of ammunition and food to Bastogne’s defenders. More
critically, Gen. George S. Patton’s 4th Armored Division was also
racing north to relieve the 101st. For the Ukraine defenders, on the
other hand, there is no such help coming...

The much-ballyhooed supply of 'heavy weapons' from the West..  will
not be enough to turn the tide"

Turkist ideology was always useful for the Anglo. Imagine you have
bunch of deluded people in a strategic peninsula who think they are

country. Frontier for what? Frontier for the Anglo. That is why the
outer alliance likes Turkist ideology - also useful for them in the
Caucuses, Central As against Russia (if it can peel off a few
countries here and there based on "common ethnicity" the better)-. So
this is the reason especially post 80s the state narrative emphasized
turning Kemal into a deitic figure, citizens were supposed to worship
Kemal, and he looks Anglo, so through Kemal you worship the Anglo
(your alliance with them).

was a viable option which remained unexplored for a while because of
the e-retards.

They talk big game on multiple universes, time, multiple dimensions,
math..  But dividing 431 by 70 and multiplying by 60? Nah can't do that.
That calc would have [given them](../../2022/02/base-energy-numbers.html#lithium)
the amount of lithium required to store one day's worth of energy on
batteries, and compared to 17 mtonnes (available reserves), it
would make blatanty clear the popular view was shit.

Scientists roam... they roam the media, MSM, alternative, or
otherwise..  Yet most of these people are just trend followers.. They
followed the electrification mantra without thinking about it.

Suez data

```python
import pandas as pd;df = pd.read_csv('suez.csv',index_col=0)
print (df[['novessel','net(mton)']].tail(3))
```

```text
      novessel  net(mton)
year                     
2019     18880     1207.1
2020     18829     1170.0
2021     20694     1127.0
```

If trend continues ships `5303*4=21212` and net tonnage `313*4=1252`
will beat the previous year's numbers. Busy busy busy..

"Head of the Suez Canal Authority.. said.. that more than 5,303 ships
carrying a combined cargo of 313.3 million tons transited the Suez
Canal during the first quarter of 2022"

The implication is people are fools, are easily led by the nose one
way or another. Want better resuls? Provide better leadership for
them.

Culture Codes can and are frequently used to influence voters who can
end up voting for stuff that are against their interests. Culture is
in emotional brain, stronger in effect than the analytic.  That's how
successful ads work too. An ad that highlights IDENTITY will sell
better in US than an ad which talks about the technical specifications
of a car.

Not only did DM help cement the culture war in US to divert attention
from real issues, he achived the same result in the United Kingdom. If
there was a psyop agent that aimed to undermine common people's
interests, it's this guy. In both cases he ended up helping the
well-to-do, the rich oligarchy by creating a smokescreen, so they hid
behind it while others yelled at eachother on bizarre issues and/or
at organizations such as the EU.

Dick Morris [again](../../2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation),
providing services on another hot-button division, playing on cultural
rifts, engaging in dubious voter manipulation.

"UKIP's triumphal march in England and Wales began in 2004. However,
arguably this 'Cinderella story' would not have materialised without
Dick Morris, who helped UKIP with its slogans, and simplified the
essential message in 2003 – this can be considered as the second
turning point.  Morris’ aim was to mobilise the anti-EU -citizens and
UKIP’s slogan was simplified to 'Say NO'; this phrasing left it to the
individual to contemplate their subjective dissatisfaction towards the
EU without UKIP putting words or arguments into their mouths. The use
of Morris’ service cost UKIP £2.36 million, but the spending enabled
UKIP to rise from sidelines to the mainstream.. As far as word choices
in the official documents are concerned, they are arguably practical,
easily understandable, appealing and easy for 'the man in the street'
to identify with"

The smart US play would have used the Zeitenwende as an opportunity to
hand Europe off to the Europeans. Sending 20k additional US troops to
Europe makes me think that’s not what we’re going to do

FT: 'Is the west’s increased defence spending even necessary?'"
