# Week 45 

H2 Central: "Photocatalytic water splitting technology.. [was]
developed over five years by the two universities. During this period,
they progressed their understanding and designs of a solar reactor
which utilises the sun’s radiation and thermal properties to increase
reaction efficiencies beyond the baseline performance of a
photocatalyst material.

Key elements of the technology.. include the use of the entire solar
spectrum to enhance reaction efficiencies along with incorporating
concentrated solar radiation via mirror reflectors. Solar
concentration increases temperature in the solar reactor, which has
been shown to increase reaction efficiencies, while allowing for a
reduction in the amount of photocatalyst material required for a given
production rate.

This technology significantly reduces the need for wind farms or
massive arrays of solar panels that are required for traditional
electrolysis, which is expected to reduce costs substantially"

Climate activists need to get into the weeds of climate tech and

have a lot of know-how they can be helpful in the transition - given
we use the right tech.

It's not about whether to "bring back nuclear" - but *what kind*. The
defining feature of the new tech is not they are "small and modular"

Leary, *Pharmageddon*: "On the surface medical practice appears the
same but underneath it’s not. For instance, a small number of people
have a genetic disorder that leads to excessively high cholesterol
levels and for them drugs like the statins can save lives.. For the
most part, however, the statins are instead given to healthy people
who have mild elevations of their cholesterol levels. Similarly,
treatments for asthma or osteoporosis are now given to many people who
would never have been diagnosed and treated before.  Treatment happens
now in response to results on a series of tests that have emerged in
recent years—but these new tests don’t help make a diagnosis that will
lift a threat to our lives. Instead they effectively make a diagnosis
of some drug deficiency disorder, and they often enter medical
practice as part of the marketing strategy for a new drug.

These new diseases and their treatments have gained a purchase on us
because they are presumed to represent the latest advances in a story
of progress that runs through insulin and the antibiotics and will
hopefully lead someday to cures for cancer. These are the drugs that,
had they been available, some presume might have saved many of my
father’s generation. But far from saving either their lives or ours,
clinical trials show that the indiscriminate use of drugs to lower
lipids or blood sugars, to relieve respiratory wheeze, or to block
stress hormones may even increase the risk of loss of life, and appear
to be doing so in the United States, the country that makes the
greatest use of the latest pharmaceuticals, where since the mid-1970s
life expectancy has been falling progressively further behind other
developed countries"

More science fail 

Kroupa: "Dark Matter Doesn't Exist.. The current cosmological model
only works by postulating the existence of dark matter – a substance
that has never been detected, but that is supposed to constitute
approximately 25% of all the universe. But a simple test suggests that
dark matter does not in fact exist. If it did, we would expect lighter
galaxies orbiting heavier ones to be slowed down by dark matter
particles, but we detect no such slow-down. A host of other
observational tests support the conclusion: dark matter is not
there. The implications of this are nothing short of a revision of
Einstein’s theory of gravitation. Why the scientific community is in
denial about the falsification of the dark matter model is a question
that requires both a sociological and philosophical explanation"
