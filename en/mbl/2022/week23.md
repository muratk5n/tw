"@CAHydrogen

Renewable, clean #hydrogen would allow for jobs in the fossil fuel
sector to transition to a clean energy economy, and be retained,
creating support from those union and trade groups, says Senator
@NancySkinnerCA"

---

As gas, underground pipe storage. Salt caverns. Lining a rock cavern
with a thin layer of steel are all possible technologies. There is ammonia.
[There are](../../2022/06/the-h2-revolution-alvera.md#storage)
many options. 

"In a statement GenH2 asked, 'How will.. hydrogen be stored at these

H2 Fuel News: "India aims for cheaper green hydrogen to accelerate its
use.. India wants the World Bank and other global funders to establish
guarantee programs to assist in making low-rate funds accessible, said
Kant. The goal is to reduce the cost of transitioning to – and using –
renewable H2, particularly in sectors where decarbonization is
difficult, such as fertilizer manufacturing, steel production and
refineries"

---

H2 View: "Two hydrogen refuelling stations planned for Poland"

---

CCS at the source is much easier to regulate, gov would be checking a
few, large installations.

---

VW now likes battery-electric cars, these people clearly alternate
between being a crook and a moron; but the energy infra should not
give them a chance to be either. Clean molecules in storage,
tranmission, and consumption can achieve that.

---

The longer fossil stays in the system, stored, transmitted, the more
the chances are for "leaking or cheating". If oil pipeline breaks it
causes environmental damage. If dirty fuels are allowed in cars with
'emission control' instituted, it will lead to cheating as in
Volkswagen's case.

---

They can have their cake and eat it. Generate 'blue' H2 and pipeline
it to customers. Clean, after CCS at the source can have no emissions
down the line, including the end-user. 

The Guardian: "Ex-UN climate envoy says continent’s need for energy is
so great it should be able to widely use the fossil fuel. African
countries should be able to exploit their vast natural gas reserves
despite the urgent need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions, the
former UN climate envoy Mary Robinson has said"

Blue steel was the other thing 🤣 \#zoolander

---

I like the name; GREEN STEEL

H2 Green Steel: "Steel production accounts for 25 percent of Europe’s
industrial CO2 emissions, which is more than the Nordics’ total CO2
emissions, or more than all flights departing from the
EU. Decarbonization is a must for the industry and disruptive
technology will be a key enabler..

So, how does it all work? In traditional steel making, reduction of
iron ore is done by heating it together with coal, utilizing a
chemical reaction that separates the oxygen from the iron, forming and
emitting CO2. In our production, green hydrogen reacts with iron ore
similarly to carbon, resulting in the extraction of oxygen. But
instead of creating CO2, the main by-product is H2O.

Large-scale green hydrogen production will enable the transition of
hard-to-abate industries towards sustainable operations. And as a
front-runner, H2 Green Steel will play an important part in
accelerating decarbonization"

“Hydrogen Economy Roadmap of Korea”, the government aims to reach the
production of 6.2 million FCEVs by 2040 with 2.9 million units for the
domestic market and 3.3 million for export. The target for fuel cell
power generation is 15 gigawatts (GW) by 2040, including 7 GW for

Al Jazeera: "The Israeli government has failed to pass a bill that
would renew and uphold the legal status of illegal Israeli settlers in
the occupied West Bank.. The failure to renew the bill on Monday
highlighted the separate legal systems in the occupied West Bank,
where nearly 500,000 Israeli settlers enjoy the benefits of Israeli
citizenship and law while some 3 million Palestinians live under
military rule that is now well into its sixth decade...

Some 500,000 Israeli settlers live in more than 120 settlements and
outposts across the occupied West Bank that are considered illegal
under international law. The settlements, which are fortified,
Jewish-only housing complexes, are continuing to expand in the
occupied West Bank as well as occupied East Jerusalem. They are seen
as a major obstacle to any potential deal with Israel..

Attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property
are common. Settlers are usually backed by armed Israeli forces when
committing such attacks"

Nordic Business: "Renewable-Powered Trains Are On Track In The
Nordics.. 'Hydrogen trains can be used on lines where it isn’t
feasible to establish catenary lines and where there’s a need for
heavier and longer transport than what battery-powered trains can
manage. Hydrogen can be refuelled in less than 20 minutes and cover up
to 18 hours of driving. and often the cost of setting up a refuelling
station will be lower than setting up an electric charging station,
for instance if this requires reinforcement of the power grid,' says
Kristina Fløche Juelsgaard, head of business development at Ballard
Europe.

Ballard Europe makes fuel cells for buses, ships and trains, among
other things. The company is part of Canada’s Ballard Power Systems
which has so far supplied fuel cells for a passenger train in the UK
and a locomotive in Canada. Ballard Europa is also involved in two
projects in Norway, one of which aims to develop a hydrogen and fuel
cell solution for a locomotive to be used for transporting ore"

capacity"

---

“Longer-term, a hydrogen pipeline network offers the most
cost-efficient means of distribution. For example, pipelines can
transmit 10 times the energy at one-eighth the costs associated with
electricity transmission lines and have capex costs similar to those
for natural gas. The industry can partially reuse existing gas
infrastructure, but even newly constructed pipelines would not be cost
prohibitive"

S&P Global: "Australia is on course to hit a notable century – but not

in recent months, a substantial number aimed at a future export
market. And in February one of them, Victoria's Hydrogen Energy Supply
Chain (HESC), created a minor sensation with the first trial cargo of
liquid hydrogen to Japan... Australia is anxious to get a foothold in
the nascent hydrogen market to counter its established,
climate-compromised position as a major exporter of coal, LNG and
crude oil"

How did *free* help tech companies? It gave rise to huge server farms

Imagine paying OS license fees for every one of those nodes in a

create their "livestreams" wout giving a second thought on how many
computing resources that entails. All that needs resources, which used
cost *more* before open-source software. The revolution, such as it

"The Russian sniper is a specially selected and skilled soldier
who.. is part of the target acquisition system... Objectives of a
sniper team during en masse employments are to hinder or channelize
movement of tactical formations and then direct artillery fire on
prioritized targets...

In Russian Military culture, artillery is called the 'God of War.'
Whereas U.S. forces rely on artillery to support maneuver, the
Russians take the opposite approach: maneuver supports artillery.
Artillery is the decisive finishing arm for the Russian Army..

The employment of UAS by Russian Forces adds another dimension to
their fires capability.  In Eastern Ukraine, Russian Forces have
demonstrated their ability to direct and adjust fires with their
drones. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly seen a systematic approach by
the Russians to acquire a target with a UAS. A high level UAS will
identify a Ukrainian target. It will then pass off that target to
another lower level UAS to determine the target coordinates. Then the
Russians will adjust their fire with the UAS based on the initial
artillery strikes. The total time for this process can be as little as
10-15 minutes...

One thing noticeably absent from Russian UAS employment is the kind of
surgical drone strike that the U.S. has used to great effect in the
past 15 years. Russia does not currently possess a weaponized UAS
similar to a Predator"
