Marcus: "Machine intelligence is increasingly being linked to claims
about sentience, language processing, and an ability to comprehend and
transform natural language into a range of stimuli. We systematically
analyze the ability of [an "AI" NLP system] DALL·E 2 to capture 8
grammatical phenomena pertaining to compositionality that are widely
discussed in linguistics and pervasive in human language: binding
principles and coreference, passives, word order, coordination,
comparatives, negation, ellipsis, and structural ambiguity. Whereas
young children routinely master these phenomena, learning systematic
mappings between syntax and semantics, DALL·E 2 is unable to reliably
infer meanings that are consistent with the syntax of the prompts"

Consa: "QED should be the quantized version of Maxwell’s laws, but it
is not that at all. QED is a simple addition to quantum mechanics that
attempts to justify two experimental discrepancies in the Dirac
equation: the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the
electron.  The reality is that QED is a bunch of fudge factors,
numerology, ignored infinities, hocus-pocus, manipulated calculations,
illegitimate mathematics, incomprehensible theories, hidden data,
biased experiments, miscalculations, suspicious coincidences, lies,
arbitrary substitutions of infinite values and budgets of 600 million
dollars to continue the game.  Maybe it is time to consider
alternative proposals. Winter is coming"

Macgregor: "[T]he military action [Patreus] advocates would not be a
NATO intervention, but “a multinational force led by the US and not as
a NATO force.”. Petraeus does not explain why U.S. military action is
needed. But it’s not hard to guess. The intervention is designed to
rescue Ukrainian forces from defeat..

Petraeus’s suggestion confirms two critical insights. First, the
perilous state of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Absent the foreign
fighters and Polish soldiers fighting in Ukrainian uniform, Ukraine
has little left to withstand the Russian winter offensives. The series
of Ukrainian counterattacks over the last 60 to 90 days have cost
Ukraine tens of thousands of lives, human capital in uniform that Kiev
cannot replace...

Second, it is the 11th hour. The Russian sledgehammer scheduled to
fall on the Zelensky regime in the November or December timeframe, or
whenever the ground freezes, will crush whatever remains of Ukrainian
forces."

"[Justin Goodman] I think [Fauci] has created a culture at the NIH
where this type of dangerous experimentation is encouraged, and
oversight of it is diminished to the highest degree possible, where
there's basically free reign to do whatever you want, and maybe report
it and maybe not, and hope for the best. But that's been happening
since 2001 for the war on terror, there were billions of dollars
dumped into Fauci's division at the NIH for bioweapons defense and
research and a lot of it has turned into this crazy gain-of-function
experimentation that likely caused this pandemic. I promise you are
going to cause another one if we don't do something about it"

Consa: "In 1949, the USSR had obtained the atomic bomb thanks to
information provided by.. a Manhattan Project researcher with
communist sympathies. From then on, espionage accusations became
widespread among the American scientific community. Senator McCarthy
began a witch hunt in which Oppenheimer was accused of treason and had
to submit to trial. The witch hunt ended in 1957, when the Russians
sent the Sputnik satellite into space and the US government realized
that it needed scientists to create NASA and win the space race"

Consa: "[Dyson said in 2006, as] one of the inventors of QED, I
remember that we thought of QED in 1949 as a temporary and jerry-built

10 years before some more solidly built theory would replace it. Now,
57 years have gone by and that ramshackle structure still stands."

Later they fudged QED results six more times

Consa: "With the new experimental data from Franken and Liebes.. [t]he
probative force of QED was upended... It was a fraud, a scandal.  But
the creators of QED refused to accept defeat. QED could not be an
incorrect theory because that placed them in an indefensible
situation. All the developments in the field of theoretical physics
that had occurred in the last decade were based on this theory. All
the privileges they had obtained after the success of the Manhattan
Project were at stake"

---

Dyson reconciled Feynman, Schwinger QED theories, which were
themselves subpar. Infinities are swept under the rug, techniques
Dirac thought illegitimate mathematics were used. The post-war rut in
physics started in the Shelter Island conference, New York.

---

Consa: "According to Dyson, [Physicist Enrico] Fermi also did not
agree with this new way of conducting science.. Fermi asked how many
free parameters he had used to obtain the fit. Smiling after being
told 'Four,' Fermi remarked, 'I remember my old friend Johnny von
Neumann used to say, with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and
with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.'"

---

Oliver Consa: "Something is rotten in the state of [Quantum
Electrodynamics. QED] is considered the most accurate theory in the
history of science. However, this precision is based on a single
experimental value: the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
(g-factor). An examination of QED history reveals that this value was
obtained using illegitimate mathematical traps, manipulations and
tricks"

$A^T A$ is surprisingly easy to switch to concurrency.

---

If $A$ is "tall and skinny" ie $A$ is m x n where n is much smaller
than m, there is some trickery using $A^T A$. A can have lots of rows
but $A^T A$ has to be n x n -by definition- which is small.

A lot of linear algebra can be paralelized. Even SVD.

Davis: "Since Russia long ago destroyed the bulk of Ukraine’s ability
to produce military equipment and ammunition, Kyiv is wholly dependent
on a non-stop stream of supplies from the West. The greatest threat to
Ukraine’s ability to wage war, therefore, is the security of supply
routes from their western borders to marshalling locations in the
interior of their country. If Putin recognizes this vulnerability, he
may mass his forces through Belarus again, but bypass Kyiv completely
and strike towards Ukraine’s western borders"

The new eLife approach can work... Every submitted paper is
automatically available (not 'rejected', or 'accepted'), publisher
assesment is still included with the published paper, others' comments
also visible, and the author can resubmit.

I'm thinking incentives.. prestigious publishers can still exist, to
the extent they can pull prestigious reviewers, the add-on they
provide will be those reviews. Readers would still be able to get a
feel of a up/down vote on the paper, but the paper is available either
way, available for others to see/comment.

When [the] @WIRED ⁩piece was written, capitalism still had (weak)

---

Wired: "[2019] What.. infuriated [the economist] Mazzucato was the
prevailing narrative that [gov spending] cuts were necessary to boost
competitiveness and innovation... 'There was this belief that we
didn’t have European Googles and Facebooks because we didn’t subscribe
to Silicon Valley’s free market approach. It was just ideology: there
was no free market in Silicon Valley.'..

[Mazzucato researched the issue]. The development of Google’s search
algorithm, for instance, had been supported by a grant from the
National Science Foundation, a US public grant-awarding body... Many
other well-known US startups had been funded by the Small Business
Innovation Research programme, a public venture capital fund. 'It
wasn’t just early research, it was also applied research, early stage
finance, strategic procurement,' she says. 'The more I looked, the
more I realised: state investment is everywhere.'"
