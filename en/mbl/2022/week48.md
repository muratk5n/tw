Well this sounds like a major PR problem.. the fix would be Charles

\#ReferenceLetters for jobs are the biggest gate-keeper in #academia

My week was rough - I skipped applying to an interesting job that
would have needed 3 references.

What is wrong with the system:

1. References create a system of life-long dependencies with supervisors  

2. They exclude those who are shy about asking for favors 

3. Referees have STRONG biases and they play out 

4. switching fields is bad

Russia's weapons manufacturing, supply lines, preparedness,

H-Tec Systems presents scalable Hydrogen Cube System..The company
H-Tec Systems from Augsburg presented the Hydrogen Cube System, HCS
for short, to a wider specialist audience at the Hanover Fair 2022...

The Cubes are available both as a closed container solution for
outdoor installation and open for indoor installation. They are
equipped with 18 PEM stacks S450 and integrated process water
treatment and power supply...

<img width="340" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hzwei.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-H-TEC_HCS_5-gross.jpg"/>

Several 2 MW cubes of this system can be combined to form a
multi-megawatt system. A system that is intended to achieve 50 MW in
the long term can also be designed in this way. According to H-Tec
Systems, the cubes achieve a system efficiency of 74 percent. They are
equipped with an integrated process water treatment and power
supply. An HCS system with five units, i.e. with an electrolysis
capacity of 10 MW, can therefore produce 4,500 kg of H 2 per day. That
makes 40 to 50 tank fillings for trucks or buses.

located 45 kilometers away from Tashkent city. The furnace is the
largest in Asia. It uses a curved mirror, or an array of mirrors,
acting as a parabolic reflector, which can reach temperatures of up to
3,000 degrees Celsius.  The place for the solar furnace of Uzbekistan
was chosen carefully, because the sun shines there for 270 days a

1) When it comes to decarbonization, the new language is “hydrogen”
(besides \#renewableenergy) 💙

2) \#Hydrogen will partly be transported via pipelines (e.g. European
Hydrogen Backbone Initiative \#EHB) – so we must take the right steps
and find the right partners now 

3) The \#energytransition is a joint goal ➡️ only achievable through
international cooperation – hydrogen is a perfect example!

4) Our \#LOHC technology = a great solution for transporting
\#greenhydrogen via ship to Italy, where the hydrogen could be injected
into pipelines💪
