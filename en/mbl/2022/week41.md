NPR: "477 stranded whales die on remote New Zealand islands.. it
appears their location systems can get confused by gently sloping
sandy beaches. [Scientist] said there is a lot of food for the whales
around the Chatham Islands, and as they swim closer to land, they
would quickly find themselves going from very deep to shallow water.
'They rely on their echolocation and yet it doesn't tell them that
they are running out of water.. They come closer and closer to shore
and become disoriented. The tide can then drop from below them and
before they know it, they're stranded on the beach.'"

Economist Steve Keen: "[In his research] Bernanke was relying on the
mainstream theory that banks simply act as intermediaries between
savers and borrowers—the ideas for which his.. Prize companions
Diamond and Dybvig received their share of the Bank of Sweden's loot
this year (the prize was created by and funded by the Central Bank of
Sweden, not the Nobel Foundation)...

[Bernanke said after GFC] 'And although there are a lot of Americans
who understandably think that government money would be better spent
going directly to families and businesses instead of banks – "where's
our bailout?," they ask – the truth is that a dollar of capital in a
bank can actually result in eight or ten dollars of loans to families
and businesses, a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a
faster pace of economic growth.'

That is the mythical 'money multiplier' model of money creation that
the Bank of England said was rubbish in 2014. But because Bernanke
believed that myth, and Obama followed his advice, the recovery from
the Global Financial Crisis was the slowest recovery from a recession
in the history of the United States. By comparison, the recovery from
the Covid recession was the fastest—and then the money went straight
to the public, rather than to the banks.

For these failures, Bernanke gets the Economics Nobel"

I like the prop. Uber, Lyft might lose profits, but they can adapt to
a new environment.

NYT: "The Labor Department.. unveiled a proposal that would make it
more likely for millions of janitors, home-care and construction
workers and gig drivers to be classified as employees rather than
independent contractors.

Companies are required to provide certain benefits and protections to
employees but not to contractors, such as paying a minimum wage,
overtime, a portion of a worker’s Social Security taxes and
contributions to unemployment insurance.
	      
The proposed rule is essentially a test that the Labor Department will
apply to determine whether workers are contractors or employees for
companies. The test considers factors such as how much control workers
have over how they do their jobs and how much opportunity they have to
increase their earnings by doing things like offering new
services. Workers who have little of either are often considered
employees"

Near endpoints generating electricity is fine.. Long-distance energy
transmission however must be gas-based. I would even pipe clean gas
into homes at that point power can be generated from fuel-cells. One
step earlier, fine again, neighborhood fuel-cell "transformer" could
generate power for the neighborhood and supply the local "grid". But
inter-city grid, inter-state grid, inter-anything grid is a no-no.  At
long distances we need to *de-fund the grid*.

High-temperature electrolysis, uses heat direct, no need for
electricity.  Very cool.

"Now, backed by industry partnerships, new legislation, an eye-popping
$7 billion in federal funds for regional clean hydrogen hubs (H2Hubs),
a new draft strategy, and on-site progress to pair electrolyzers with
nuclear plants, the potential for nuclear-powered production of clean
hydrogen is clearer than ever.

In August, DOE-NE’s Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program,
in coordination with the HFTO, offered between 20 million and 40
million USD in cost-shared funding to support the demonstration of an
'energy park' drawing 20–300 MW of thermal energy from a U.S. nuclear
power plant. That funding would tackle the design of the
heat-extraction infrastructure needed use high-temperature steam from
existing LWRs to produce hydrogen using high-temperature electrolysis
'in preparation for future scale-up of industrial use of nuclear
energy.' Proposals were invited both for the engineering and design
work needed to extract steam from a nuclear power plant, termed
'Nuclear Plant Thermal Integration'"
