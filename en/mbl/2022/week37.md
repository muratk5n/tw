RFERL: "Another Russian Executive Dies In String Of Strange Deaths Of
Tycoons.. The top manager at Russia's [KRDV].. Ivan Pechorin, has been
found dead after media reports said last weekend that he fell out of a
motorboat.. 

In early September, LUKoil, Russia's largest private oil company and
one of the few corporate voices to oppose to the Kremlin's war in
Ukraine, said its chairman, Ravil Maganov, had died in Moscow
following a "serious illness," while local media reports said the
67-year-old tycoon had plunged to his death from a hospital window.

In May, Russian media reported that a former top manager of LUKoil,
Aleksandr Subbotin, was found dead in the basement of a house in the
town of Mytishchi near Moscow.

Weeks before that..  a former top manager at Russian gas giant
Novatek, Sergei Protosenya, his wife, and daughter had been found dead
in a rented villa in the town of Lloret de Mar near Barcelona.

Several other senior Russian businessmen and their families have also
been found dead amid unclear circumstances since Russia started its
full-scale aggression against Ukraine.

On February 8, KVRD Director General Igor Nosov died at the age of 43.
The death was officially announced as caused by a stroke"

Hydrogen Europe: "Following the plenary vote on the Renewable Energy
Directive II (REDII), Hydrogen Europe wholeheartedly welcomes the
historical European Parliament (EP) decision to commit to ambitious
binding renewable targets and to simplify the regulatory framework...

Further good news from the parliament today is the return of the
additionality principle to legal regulation, rather than delegating
this to the European Commission via the Delegated Act of RED II. This
will ease the implementation of the additionality principle for
renewable hydrogen. MEPs have listened to the sector’s concerns that
overly strict regulations would hinder the development of this crucial
market. Hydrogen Europe fully recognises the importance, and supports,
the principle of additionality but has expressed concerns regarding
the practical implementation of the proposed criteria, not the
principle itself. The task at hand is to find a balance between
ensuring green hydrogen is produced from new renewable energy capacity
and avoiding excessive constraints on a nascent market"

The biggest downside of the royalty is they cement certain type of

so their very presence might lulled people thinking all is fine. Get

George Ellis: "Theoretical physics and cosmology find themselves in a
strange place. Scientific theories have since the seventeenth century
been held tight by an experimental leash. In the last twenty years or
so, both string theory and theories of the multiverse have slipped the
leash. Their owners argue that this is no time to bring these subjects
to heel.

It is this that is strange.

The multiverse is a collection, set, or ensemble of possibly disjoint
universes. They are possible because no one knows whether they
exist. Max Tegmark has contemplated four different kinds of
multiverse, and Brian Greene, nine. Nothing exceeds like excess"

"Researchers Discover a Single Catalyst Capable of Splitting Both
Freshwater and Seawater at Low Voltage..  [They] report using a nickel

and grown on nickel foam to efficiently produce hydrogen and then,
through a process of electrochemical reconstruction sparked by cycling
voltage, converted to a compound that produced a similarly powerful
oxygen evolution reaction.

The researchers said using a single compound for both the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) –
albeit slightly changed through the reconstruction process – not only
makes water splitting more affordable, it also simplifies the
engineering challenges"
