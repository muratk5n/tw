H2 View "Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation [in US] to provide natural
gas for the Great Plains Hydrogen Hub in the US.. Based in North
Dakota, US, Bakken Energy and Mitsubishi Power Americas have joined
forces on a $2bn hub which will focus on blue hydrogen production
which is derived from natural gas with the carbon emissions being
capture and sequestered.. The duo said they hope to connect the
facility by pipeline to other hydrogen hubs currently being developed
throughout North America"

300000 x 1000 x33.6 / (365x24x1e6) gives 1.15 Gigawatts. Lot of energy,
equivalent to one nuclear plant.

"Suez Canal green hydrogen production... With news that Egypt will
gain a new 300,000 tonnes waste-to-hydrogen production plant, it is
clear hydrogen will become a major aspect of the nation’s renewable
future whilst also leveraging its export potential"

"Japan to divert LNG to Europe amid Russia-Ukraine tensions"

---

Fusion, clean fuel pipeliens.. all about the hydrogen atom.

---

After, especially after, fusion becomes viable, H2 infrastructure be
essential to transport the power in efficient ways. 10 times faster
then the grid at 8th the cost.

---

Good progress. But beware, fusion energy did not 'arrive' yet

BBC: "The UK-based JET laboratory has smashed its own world record for
the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of
hydrogen...  Fusion reactions in the lab famously consume more energy
to initiate than they can output... But there is solid evidence that
this deficit can be overcome.. It's hoped the French lab will get to
breakeven."

This is reserves not annual production. 

---

IRN, Number Two. RU, Number One. 

---

"Qatar.. ranking 3rd in the world, holds.. about 12% of the world's total natural gas reserves "

---

Few things jump out from the graph; coal consumption went down, natgas
took its place (just as polluting, if not more). Natgas is now on par
with oil but I'd say NG is now the king.

The oscillations for natgas indicates to me its consumption is much
more sensitive / responsive to demand, is depended on more, looks
seasonal so NG is probably the primary method for heating. NG is the
king to unseat. Or utilize, with blue H2, it's fine.

Nuclear use has been flat; if nuke plants were doubled it still
would not reach natgas levels.

Renewables are at an abysmal level.

---

Japanese real-estate bubble (1986-1990)? Look at the central bank
rates during that same period, they were at their lowest level they
had been since WWII. Ergo, bubble. Bubble burst but a stagnation
remained.. Abenomics gave more money to the rich, salaries did not
budge. No inflation. Low rates.

That could be ok depending on the social norms.. Excessive wealth

"But then anyone can see who owns what"

---

NFT is simply a record of ownership, it's intangible; but there is a
lot of intangible even in the most tangible asset there is -
[property](../../0119/2008/03/revolutionary-wealth-toffler.html#intangible).

Without the record of who owns what real-estate would have no meaning.
In some distant future such record-keeping could completely move to
peer-to-peer based service. If gov, or a future form of gov
decides to enforce that instead of the ones it keeps itself, then
peer-to-peer digital assets would become the final arbiter of
ownership.

---

Globalization (now re-globalization) happened [before](../../0119/2008/03/revolutionary-wealth-toffler.html#globalization)
(didn't end well).

---

Diversity of products a country can produce raises its econ, not how much it is globalized.

What is the current RU natgas export (to EU) shortfall? 20%? Lower?

From UK we know blending 20% H2 into existing natural gas pipeline
works. If the tech were ready that would fix gas shortfall. Blending
wld automatically increase supply. For gaps <20% blend 20%, done. No
change in infra needed.

Additional H2 needs to be generated for blending yes, not available
yet -- the crisis arrived too early.

Anti-trust isn't just for better capitalism. Need to adjust the power
dynamic between gov and biz. Reagan was a conservative, but he had to
be cognizant of the fact that in order to govern, need to keep
monopoly power at bay.


---

Would expect Dems to be more hawkish on anti-trust, but no..  After RR
not only did they let existing monopolies fester, they gave rise to
new ones. So called libertarians either watched the whole thing like a
gaping fish, or generated some junk culture war material for Reps to
use while weaseling their way in, to give billionaire cover.

Anti-trust could be a Republican thing.. cons are pro-business,

TDB: "When writer and filmmaker Rupert Russell sat down to write his

bonus episode of The New Abnormal, Russell explains how a move by
Greenspan to deregulate the commodity markets in 1998 has caused
decades of market trouble"

Libertarianism is corrupted in US.. A coopted version is used to
provide cover for billionaires while they push for pro-freedom-sounding
ideas, at the same time they generate culture war material to make
themselves useful among the equally corrupt, retarded right-wing
Republicans. All those merry band of cocksuckers around Peter Thiel do
nothing but that.. The German version of a libertarian will fight
an abortion rule created by *actual Nazis*, US faux-libertarians will
stand silent on the issue to weasel their way in to Rep circles then once
inside push for [anti-green agenda](../../2022/01/faux-contrarians-faux-liberterians.html).
These are truly some wretched cocksuckers.

It's about picking the right pieces, which means the right-sized
pieces. Tiny particles are too numerous, plus never clearly defined /
definable.  They are not the right components to put together for
*greater sum*. But looking at macro measurable attributes, placing
those together in nonlinear ways (or transform them in ways so they
can be added linearly) is the right granularity and an approach that
work for us (humans).

"You said science is not about tiny particles, instead mathematical
relations, but in greater sum approach you say nonlinear combos can
have large effects"

German Greens are fine with all colors. Skeptics shld take notice.

DW: "Green is the color denoting the most environmentally friendly
hydrogen because it's made with renewable energies through
electrolysis and entirely free of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, there is
"blue hydrogen," which is derived from fossil gas but considered low
carbon because it uses carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to
bury the related CO2 emissions underground. And finally, there's
"turquoise hydrogen," which is manufactured using natural gas
pyrolysis, a process that creates solid carbon as a byproduct instead
of CO2.

Like Germany's liberals, the European Commission has acknowledged all
four types of hydrogen are important for achieving carbon neutrality,
saying fossil-based H2 with carbon storage is a crucial stepping stone
in growing the hydrogen market in its early stages"

---

Another color.

H2 View: "[Ekona's 'turquise H2' tech] uses heat recovery and
combustion to generate the heat energy and high temperatures that are
required to drive the methane splitting reaction. In addition to this,
the platform is low-cost, scalable, and can be flexibly sited wherever
natural gas infrastructure exists."

---

Green fuels can handle both long and short distances. For TCO and econ
reasons it will be adopted at the exclusion of the rest. Why bother
with two seperate tech when u can do with one? This is Betamax over
VHS territory. Tech adoption does not do participation trophies.

"Batteries can do the short distances, green hydrogen can do the long distances"

Offshore production is dangerous. The ship/offshore setup is weird,
processing is on the ship? Then the ship sinks. Let's not have any
fossil on any ships. No fossil on any transport. No offshore. No
fracking. No flaring. Green fuels only.

Yahoo! News: "Two-million-barrel oil tanker 'explodes' off Nigeria's
