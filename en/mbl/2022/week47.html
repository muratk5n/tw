[Yellowstone]. Guess who doesn’t want to admit it? <em>Yellowstone:
One-Fifty</em> sidesteps the truth, which is the Hayden survey [that led
to the creation of the park] was an unabashedly federal project. He
had Congressional funding and orders from the Department of the
Interior. He and his team took the transcontinental railroad (the
existence of which was the end result of another federal project) to
Utah to begin the survey. He had a 2nd Cavalry protective detail out
of Fort Ellis (a federal installation). His Yellowstone survey report
was printed and distributed by the Government Printing Office"</p>

<p>The prevalence of QED could have something do with Europeans feeling a
bit down about themselves at the time.. Imagine that Shelter Island
meeting, two years after the end of the WWII where Europe had
destroyed itself (again), and here they are, the elder scientist are
sitting in a New World conference, watching two young American
scientists all wired, flailing away talking energetically about some
crazy bizarre theory Europeans must have thought, well, maybe this
crazy shit is the new way, we destroyed ourselves with our science and
tech. Who knows? Maybe we should pass the torch..</p>
<hr />
<p>Theoretical physics (along with cosmology) has gone awry, ever since
70s nothing of significance has been done, and worse, bizarre
unfounded theories like string theory were pursued for decades. Where
to pin the blame?</p>
<p>QED could be the original sin. Think about it, once you ignore data,
engage in scientific fraud, push whopping infinities under the rug to
make a theory "work" what else can you not do? 10-20 dimensions, the
multiverse, many-worlds, quantum computation.. the sky will be the
limit. Because now you are only "limited by your imagination" (cue in
the image of a wacky Einstein), anything goes, right?</p>

have enough political capital.. Add to that recent losses, he was
done. Much of the Woke junk started during (returning CEO) Iger's time

was steady about it. News says he will chose a successor, if he choses

hydrogen. '[This] is a strong signal for the entire hydrogen market in

<p>Burn</p>
<p>Kelvin: "In science there is only physics; all the rest is stamp collecting"</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, IMO the "beauty argument" pushed in sci circles must have been
there to offset the "shut up and compute" crowd. We could argue the
beauty argument was overdone as well, essentially they simply called
for an economy in the formulation where if two explanations were
equally correct choosing the simpler one... but the excess must have
been there to balance the opposite. </p>
<hr />
<p>The creation of QED also marks the shift of sci center from Europe to
US, and it so happens that the culture code of technology in US is IT
WORKS meaning doesnt matter how something is made, if it works, it's
fine. Not to be too discriminating here but I think the Europeans are
a little more into architecting, economy in their base frameworks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Looking at the history of QED, it's understandable where the 'shut up
and compute' idiom came from - I dont think this chestnut was
specifically QM related. It has more to do with QED. Bcz remember what
is QED?  A bizarrely convoluted process that formulizes something (the
so-called Feynman diagrams were the necessary simplifying tool for the
unnecessarily complex procedure) but "it worked" so at that point you
had to "shut up and compute".</p>
