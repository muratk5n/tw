<p>H2 Central: "[Motor Vehicle Manufacture Poppe + Potthoff GmbH] has
designed an alternative specifically for pipes and rails in hydrogen
applications... PPH2 is an alloyed carbon steel with high mechanical
properties, which are further enhanced by the innovative PPSH
annealing treatment. These special properties allow the production of
thinner-walled components (compared to stainless steel) and thus a
reduction in weight while increasing the availability of hydrogen
pipes and rails"</p>

Newsom said in a press release. 'Big Oil has been lying and gouging

the work ahead with our partners in the Legislature to get this done.'
California lawmakers kicked off a special legislative session on

<p>That is a nice little word play there with the title, it can be

<hr />
<p>From the book <em>ISIS IS US</em>: "Did the 'Islamic State' spring full-blown
into spontaneous being as the fanatical scourge of the Middle East, or
was it helped along by state sponsors?</p>
<p>The parallels with Iran-Contra are uncanny. In the 1980’s, the Reagan
administration wanted to topple the government of Nicaragua, using
right-wing mercenaries, death squads, based in Honduras.  But Congress
passed a law prohibiting that. So they went around it, by financing
the Contras via Iran.  Thirty years later, the hawks in Washington
wanted to topple the elected governments of Libya and Syria, crush the
popular resistance in Iraq, and split up those countries on ethnic
lines. Once again, they wanted to do this using death squads...</p>
<p>To set up the Sunni and Shiite death squads to fight each other in
Iraq, they sent John Negroponte as Ambassador to Baghdad in 2004. The
same guy they sent to Honduras as Ambassador from 1981 to 1985. Then
in 2011 they sent some of those killers from Iraq to Libya to
overthrow Qaddafi, with NATO air cover. From Libya, they were sent to
Syria to start the killing there – the dirty war directed by
Negroponte’s right-hand man, US Ambassador Ford.  The US embedded
media perversely pinned these killings on Assad, following the script
for another NATO invasion. Only Russia’s UN veto spared Syria"</p>

<p>Netan has always been a status quo handling inconsequential middle
manager, like many others in his generation. The one time he did
something substantial albeit foolish, as with judicial reform, the

anything really; He'll get the muck out at some point when he does and
noone will care.</p>

<hr />
<p>Attempting to coexist with an existing fiat system invites undue
problems for both sides; new money's selling point will be freer,
easier exchange and that invites crime, money laundering. Over years
old fiat added all sorts of safeguards, which the Wild West of the new
threatens to run roughshod over burning big and small users, something
old fiat gov cannot ignore (ppl vote). When mildly integrated into the
old, the new is a speculation plaything, pushing it away from its
original mission. Lose-lose all around.</p>
<hr />
<p>Money is inextricably tied to politics / governance. There is no
"politics free money". Unlike what some naive libertarians seem to
think even gold was tied to a system - <a href="../../0119/2011/11/debt-religions-money.html">kings made it possible</a>, 
without them there would be no gold currency. Therefore, hard to change
currency (ie to crypto) without changing governance, at a
fundamental level.</p>

<p>The left hand, and the right hand..  One does not know the other. But
sometimes, the right hand can leave bread crums for left hand to find,
to force action on a certain problem.. Through friends in Pakistani
ISI US deep state knew where Bin Laden was kept. It's all about
information. Once you know that location, you sit on it, and you own
his ass. Then, at the right time, the "invisible hand" will release
the info where it can be "discovered" by the other hand because it is
obvious what they will do with that information, attempt to kill Bin
Laden, which they did. As most know by now BL was killed at a
residence half a mile away from a Pak military training academy.</p>

<p>The inflation of faux ethnic "heritage" or PC identities help alienate
the common man from the rest; they want your being chopped up into
tiniest little pieces so it will be impossible for you to identify
with a fellow citizen, and especially with the plight of the common
man or woman. The further away the system makes one from the masses,
in mentality, in general feeling, the better off they are.  Fellow
citizen is one paycheck away from bankruptcy but shitlib looks at him
and thinks 'does he identify as non-binary, genderqueer, metrosexual?
Is he Estonian / Scottish, Scottish / Italian, she/him/they, Polish /
Eskimo / Whateverfuck?' All these labels create artificial obstacles
for relating.. which likely is the aim.</p>

<p>Formulation, theory requires more than "functions". In materials
science a steel beam under stress has the displacement formula
$E I \frac{d^4 y}{d X_1^4} = q$ , a fourth order dif eq, that ain't a
function. When solved w given cond result is one, and a different
one for each condition; all from the same base formula. AI has a
long way to go.</p>
<hr />
<p>There has been some clumsy attempts to create "theoretical basis of
AI" I remember one proof that equated learning with compression - if
one cld compress certain data one can learn that data. But, the way
they defined learning (they called "PAC learning") was such that
naturally compression would be the obvious answer, which isn't that
interesting at all. You assume inputs, outputs and a "function" in
between, what the flack else could be the outcome? A smaller
representation in terms of a function, which is, compression.</p>

<p>"[Workers at a] construction company noticed something odd about their

way... a modern Xerox photocopier.. scans the document digitally, and
then prints the resulting image file. Combine that with the fact that
virtually every digital image file is compressed to save space, and a
solution to the mystery begins to suggest itself...  Lossy compression
is often used for photos, audio, and video in situations in which
absolute accuracy isn’t essential...</p>

<p>"Ben" has some interesting observations on crypto land..</p>
<p>Prospect: "Signature Bank had reinvented itself as one of the
crypto-friendliest banks in America, possibly to offset an unusual
slump in its previous client base, the New York City landlord
class. But while the big bet had shrunk its stock price, Signature
seemed to have weathered Crypto Winter all right until a hysterical
billionaire bank run took out Silicon Valley Bank on March 10...</p>
<p>[I]t’s a uniquely American feature of political and
financial crises that the characters our systems hold accountable for
their bottomless supply of elaborate malfeasance seem always to lean
toward the implausibly clownish. A conspicuously impaired 22-year-old
named Lynndie England bore responsibility for a sprawling assembly
line of physical and psychological torture at Abu Ghraib while her
higher-ups skated; a 30-year-old Goldman Sachs trader nicknamed
“Fabulous Fab” was the most senior bulge bracket bank executive
indicted in the multitrillion subprime CDO racket while his hedge fund
clients walked away billionaires.</p>
<p>So it goes with the gargantuan phalanx of flimflammers and rug-pullers
who sold America’s debt-enslaved youth on the fever dream of the
blockchain. Yes, SBF is behind bars, but.. billionaires who
shamelessly shilled for so many other interconnected
cash-for-counterfeit schemes just orchestrated a $42 billion bank run
and were instantly rewarded with an unprecedented bailout"</p>

<p>This word became prevalent with the US deep state project ISIS who
called themselves "a worldwide caliphate" which tells you what the
shadowy figures in the dark corners of US policy want to happen in the
Islamic world. They would like to have a Caliphate which they could
influence, the label could be used as a wrecking ball, hit one
goverment or the other when they disagree, manufacture managed chaos
which then could further be utilized as a pretext for operations "to
bring democracy" there.</p>
<hr />
<p>An official Caliph no longer exists; the title was abolished when the
last Ottoman mucker holding it was stripped of it, and later the royal
family fled from Stanpoli to UK en masse anyway (to UK, interesting
isn't it?). Saudi Arabia is not a caliphate, they are the keepers of
the holy sites, but SA ruler is not a caliph. Neither is the Egyptian
head of gov, or UAE, or even Jordan (where the current king is a
descendant of Mohammad).</p>
