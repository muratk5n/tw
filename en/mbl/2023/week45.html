<p>Wiki: "Revisionist Zionism is a form of Zionism which is characterized
by territorial maximalism. Revisionist Zionism promoted expansionism
and the establishment of a Jewish majority on both sides of the Jordan
River. Developed by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.. [it] insisted upon the Jewish
right to sovereignty over the whole of Eretz Yisrael, which they
equated to Mandatory Palestine and Transjordan..</p>

<p>Ars Technica: "[W]hen evidence emerged in the early 1970s about the
health effects of indoor nitrogen dioxide exposure from gas stove use,
the American Gas Association launched a campaign designed to
manufacture doubt about the existing science. As a researcher who
has studied air pollution for many years—including gas stoves’
contribution to indoor air pollution and health effects—I am not naïve
about the strategies that some industries use to avoid or delay
regulations. But I was surprised to learn that the multipronged
strategy related to gas stoves directly mirrored tactics that the
tobacco industry used to undermine and distort scientific evidence of
health risks associated with smoking starting in the 1950s"</p>

<p>The Guardian: "When a microbe was found munching on a plastic bottle
in a rubbish dump, it promised a recycling revolution. Now scientists
are attempting to turbocharge those powers in a bid to solve our waste
crisis.. [I]n 2001, a group of Japanese scientists [from Kyoto
Institute of Technology and the Keio University] made a startling
discovery at a rubbish dump. In trenches packed with dirt and waste,
they found a slimy film of bacteria that had been happily chewing
through plastic bottles, toys and other bric-a-brac... [S]ince 2021, a
French company named Carbios has been running an operation that uses a
bacterial enzyme to process about 250kg of PET plastic waste every
day, breaking it down into its precursor molecules"</p>

<p>Cosmos Mag: "The race to produce cheap green hydrogen has a new and
serious competitor with India announcing a suite of green hydrogen
plans..  The Green Hydrogen Policy put out by the Ministry of New and
Renewable Energy (MNRE) envisages the production of 10 million tons of
green hydrogen by 2030 with half of that being used as a substitute
for fossil fuels in transport and in the hard to abate industrial
sectors.  The other 5 million tons would be earmarked for
export... [N]umerous private firms such as Reliance, Adani, ReNew
Power and L&amp;T [are] lining up for a piece of the action. Reliance
wants to produce green hydrogen for $USD1 a kg by 2030. Ten states led
by Gujarat, but including Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala, have also
been identified as potential production hubs"</p>

Jewish extremists.. His father, Benzion — who worked as an assistant

referred to as 'a good fascist' — was a leader in the Herut Party that
called on the Jewish state to seize all the land of historic

everything (look at how battery electric cars became prevalent) if you
