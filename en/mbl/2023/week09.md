😆 😆 😆 So *The West Wing*.. Constant drama. Were there aides,
passing papers to each other in the hallway?

WaPo: "[The honorary chairman of the U.S. bid for the 2022 tournament]
Bill Clinton reportedly smashed a mirror after hearing Qatar won the
2022 World Cup bid [in 2010]'

---

But Al Jazeera is a good channel, a good source for info most of the
time. Just saying these are some of the things that go through my mind
when docus like that show up.

---

I guess FIFA/Qatar tried to make the best of it by trying to organize
a good Cup, and making sure (!) Argentina got the Prize (that penalty
in the last game.. shady).

---

Aahh the 2010s.. Qatar was on the move, on the rise, helping "topple
dictators" Kaddafi, Mubarak, stirring shit up along with US all over
the globe.. Woo hooo! We have arrived baby! Winning the rights to host
the 2022 FIFA World Cup was part of that rise. We know the rest of the
story - the Arab Spring turned sour (along with Qatar's claim for the
top spot), the allegation of bribery of FIFA officials became so
rampant it destroyed the careers of all involved, including then chief
S. Blatter.

Hah. Al Jazeera docu defends their involvement in the Arab Spring as
siding with "democracy". That's not exactly true, especially thinking
AJ's money source, Qatar. Why would Qatar, an emirate care about
democracy?  They cared more about spreading their own influence in the
region, and to supplant Saudi Arabia as a power center.

TFI Global: "The American strategy in the Ukraine conflict is aimed
solely at severing ties between Europe and Russia, and the West has
made desperate attempts to do so. However, in the end, their efforts
may be in vain...

invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, a paper published by.. [DE]
economy ministry claimed that trade data showed a 'considerable

All things considered, has the US been a "force for good" in the
world?

The report card is spotty. Just the other day I read about "Sam the
Banana Man" Zemurray, a US businessman, when his banana business was
threatened in Honduras, he personally organized a coup, created a
small civilian army put them on a ship sent them over to Honduras to
fight the government, contributed to the overthrow of a democratically
elected president (USG mostly stood by and in the end helped
him). That's not all, the newly installed president **paid him** for
the trouble using Honduras' taxpayer money. How is that for money well
spent?

"Each year, 119 billion pounds of food is wasted in the United

Besides the GHG issue, farming takes up too much space and is likely
bad for the environment. A new system could discourage it all. Limit
ownership of land enough for shelter, non-farm production, the rest
becomes public land, only automated, vertical farming is encouraged,
meat production through lab-based methods.

be in effect for 2024.
