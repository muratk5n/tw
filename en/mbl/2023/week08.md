Paper: "Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for solid
hydrogen storage due to its superior hydrogen storage capacity... Our
results obtained by spin-polarized density functional theory
calculations with van der Waals corrections (DFT-D3) unveiled an
interesting “burst effect” during MgH2 dehydrogenation"

FT: "The big bet on hydrogen vehicles.. Toyota and Hyundai believe in the
alternative fuel.. Large vehicles, such as trucks, need an alternative
to battery electric power. The distances they travel mean electric
alternatives require heavy batteries.. for hydrogen-powered commercial
vehicles — buses and trucks — growth has been much stronger than
expected. Hyundai’s Xcient trucks have expanded market share rapidly
since last year, on the roads in Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand and
South Korea. Deliveries arrive in the US and Israel this year. In
China, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle sales, led by buses, nearly tripled
last year"

It's true.. the sounds are truly a mess. The cacaphony is an
anti-propaganda for Islam the religion. Loud church bells are annoying
too BTW.

Quora: "I’m Muslim and I’ll tell you what I hate about [call to
prayer, Azan], (at least in major cities..)

VOLUME.

Mosques are located in just about every neighborhood and they all
blast the adhan at the loudest possible volume.

What results is an unintelligible, screaming, mess of sound, that
would be entirely unidentifiable as anything even slightly related to
a call to religious worship if it weren’t for blips of the rise and
fall of the familiar cadence that sometimes makes its way through the
mess because they all play at slightly different times, so the words
of each fight with those of the other"

"Norway produces 50% of 'energy' with hydropower!!". When you look
closely it is electricity, not just "energy" and elec consump is at
20%. So now the number goes down to 10% - for a country of 5 million ;)
Is this supposed to impress someone?

---

Of overall *energy* the percentage is actually <4%. Electricity does
not represent all energy consumption (a mere 15% in most
countries). That is why most rosy renewable energy numbers are also
false eg Germany, Norway

"Today the US produces just 7% of its energy from renewables, the
majority from hydroelectric schemes"

It looks like generating things that can be interpreted one way or
another problem (some might call that art) was solved earlier by today's
crude attempts at AI.. Didn't scifi shows and movies have us believe
art was the *last* thing to arrive? The android on Trek tried very
hard to make jokes, create paintings after demonstrating excellent
abilities in strong AI, feats today's algorithms can't even touch. I
guess the only thing the super duper android from 24th century had to
do was use some shit neural network code from 21st century, shove
bunch of data in there, and let it "generate art" for him.

---

See sample GDELT output files [here](http://data.gdeltproject.org/events).
Pick one, and check `Actor1Name`, `Actor2Name`, and `EventCode`
triplets for every record, meaning someone does something to someone
else. Half the time they are wrong... This is one of the best language models.
Use SOTA, and forget 90, 95%, if you can surpass 80% I will eat my hat. 

The codes are documented in this [PDF](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf).

---

When specific answers are required to be true, one could say part of
the definition of (strong) AI, deep neural nets have a huge problem.

---

It goes wrong frequently, miscategorizes stuff all the time

"GDELT uses some of the world's most sophisticated natural language
and data mining algorithms, including the world's most powerful deep
learning algorithms, to extract more than 300 categories of events,
millions of themes and thousands of emotions and the networks that tie
them together"

Politico: "The First Step Act, a criminal-justice reform law, created,
among other things, quicker pathways home for certain nonviolent
federal prisoners and delivered some sentencing reforms... Activists
now estimate that perhaps 20,000 people have been released so far
because of the law, according to Lance Kramer, the producer of the
newly released documentary The First Step. And this happened because a
self-described “law-and-order” president [Trump], who had months
earlier called for the execution of major drug dealers, somehow found
common ground with members of the social-justice left.

There are doctoral degrees awarded for machine learning; was it too
premature to turn this 'eclectic mix of CS/Stat subjects' into a whole

all they have is applications that are created by jury rigging ever
larger neural nets, feeding more and more data into them to do it.

landlocked. Clearly Vietnam has been better at war.

some SYR-IRQ connection in the SE, and of course US has a base there
(Al-Tanf) and the area is conveniently infested with the Sunni
extremist Daesh.

David Mumford (Fields medal winner) started some work around the
mathematics of intelligence, pattern recognition, in a book on what he
calls "pattern theory"; this direction needs to be explored further
IMO. 

---

Mainstream "AI" research is moving in a completely wrong
direction. They need to change direction, fix how they conduct the
science.

---

There is a term in FD formulas that says 'if there is a pressure
difference between two regions there will be a force between those
regions, from high to low' for example. This is the type of formula
AI, or AGI needs, not "neurons". Observe external variables (via
experiments, trial/error), then using mathematics create releations
among them. AGI needs to follow the same approach adopted by nearly
all natural sciences. What are the variables of intelligence? What is
the Calculus that can bind them together? These need to be
invented. It isn't about "computation", not at first, brogrammers are
slow to grasp this..  It's about declarative, broad relations, finding
the ever-present pattern among them, like making a cat's
cradle. Starting with one set of relations, transforming it another,
it goes on.. Then as a *last* step, you can compute.

---

There is a fluid dynamics *formula* that works for any point in space,
point in time, at macro level.. We "discretize" that formula, chop it
up into pieces for computation and program that into the computer,
much later. This is a different approach from using micro particles
trying to build up to a system. As with many other things bottom up
approach doesn't work, top-down design is necessary. High
organization / design matters.

---

We don't simulate fluids with particles

"[Deep] neural nets will give us true AI, intelligence is all about
neurons, if we can simulate enough neurons we can simulate the brain,
just like simulating water with many (water) particles"

But Al Jazeera has good content overall, and a fair take on the

Qatar (who finances Al Jazeera) must still be butthurt from not being

that amnesty and, say, the capture of Falluja in 2014 by ISIS, years
later.

Science.org: "The Malian discovery was vivid evidence for what a small
group of scientists, studying hints from seeps, mines, and abandoned
wells, had been saying for years: Contrary to conventional wisdom,
large stores of natural hydrogen may exist all over the world, like
oil and gas—but not in the same places. These researchers say
water-rock reactions deep within the Earth continuously generate
hydrogen, which percolates up through the crust and sometimes
accumulates in underground traps. There might be enough natural
hydrogen to meet burgeoning global demand for thousands of years,
according to a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) model that was presented
in October 2022 at a meeting of the Geological Society of America"

But there might be more to mull over here.. A theologian once said
'every prophet worked as a shephard at least once in their
lives'.. I'd made a connection back then with them gaining people
management skills through the work (people are sheep), but this
pastoral people business brings in a new angle; were prophets
temperamentally pastoral but peaceful who wanted to be left alone by
the plundering farmer-slave state, then created a space for themselves
and like-minded others through a religious ideology?

If wages/inf is problematic, within this system there isn't much else
