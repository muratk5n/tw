H2 Central: "New design for high-power-density fuel cells offers
improved performance and durability – Los Alamos Lab. Promising new
hydrogen fuel cell technology has up to 50% higher performance than
current, state-of-the-art technology, with improved durability. The
grooved electrode design advance may help optimize next-generation
fuel cell technology"

The minute a search engine has content-based products, they have a

profitable those content products are, the stronger the incentive to

advertising either banned outright or simply out of family spaces,
despite how immensely profitable it all was — yet we still have to

Any software company can be split, and not vertically (along different
competencies) either. They can be split horizontally, cutting across
all of its services. Any service can be split. Mastodon proved even a
social network, which people thought had to be owned by one
organization (uh, like due to 'network effect' or something) could be
split across many servers combined by a light protocol. What else can
be seperated this way? How about digital ad monopolies?

"Two newly-announced projects add to a growing list of
hydrogen-propulsion partnerships in Northern Europe. In Boden, Sweden
and Duisburg, Germany, H2 suppliers and shipping companies have
announced additional initiatives to bring this green fuel to the
maritime market.

Swedish ferry operator Gotland Company announced Monday that it has
reached an offtake agreement with hydrogen producer H2 Green Steel
(H2GS). H2GS is the developer of a massive electrolyzer plant in
Boden, a town in northern Sweden. The 700 MW plant will be among the
largest in the world, and it will primarily supply a carbon-neutral
steel mill"

the working class will benefit somehow until the point they find

Theories on UFOs, political assasinations help to keep the image of
all-powerful gov alive, shifting attn away from the private sector
towards the government. In most UFO mysteries there's always the
subtext "government knows more than they are telling you". Ok that's
scary brrr so I guess now I should buy me some guns help Bushmaster
make some money, be against all regulations help Norfolk Southern make
money, or any kind of busienss restriction so all businesses make even
more money. 🤨

Wired: "[2023/04] The Search for Long Covid Treatments Takes a
Promising Turn..  Three years in, the pandemic mania has settled to a
rumbling hum.. thanks to vaccines and treatments.

The same can’t be said of long Covid, the mysterious, life-limiting
ailment that lingers on after an initial Covid infection... Estimates
of how many people have long Covid vary, but it’s been put as high as
around 65 million..

The idea that long Covid has different causes could go some way toward
explaining the sheer diversity of symptoms, which number up to 200"

future be exported competitively to the EU and US to make low-carbon
steel in decarbonized installations, according to speakers at the

"A hydrogen pipeline carrying 2.5 million tonnes per year from the

Let's say a mechanism to compute the area of a circle (given its
radius) is needed. Do we throw bunch of "data" of radius/area pairs to
a parrot learner and hope it spits back something approaching real
answer?  No.

Here is what you do; mentally take out a piece of the circle,

[Figure 1](infp1.jpg)

.. and other pieces like that, flip every other one place them side by
side

[Figure 2](infp2.jpg)

Again, mental exercise, we think 'if I made the pieces smaller does
that *approach* a known calculation?' Yes it does,

[Figure 3](infp3.jpg)

It approaches the area of a rectangle. We already know how to compute
that, height times width, $C/2 r$, $C$ is circumference, $C = 2 \pi
r$, area is $\pi r^2$. Boom.

We just used mental transformations (in complex problems the algebra
is more complex but still symbolic) to reach something simpler. That
final formula is the end-result, the fruit of science. The end-result
is fast to compute, and accurate. Simple manipulation w algebra,
geometry saved me from countless computations. This is how science is
done, through representations, mental transformations. 

---

Why is the neural net approach to AI is a big fat failure? They are
not following the proven method of science, even of pre-modern
science.. From get-go they compute stuff, and compute blindly. Science
uses representations, transformation, mental shortcuts so you *don't*
have to compute shit all the time. Practitioners of faux AI have it
backwards.

More resources, more munee

Peoples Dispatch: "[2022/12] US interference in the DR Congo has been
apparent since its independence, Musavuli added—in the assassination
of Patrice Lumumba, support given to the brutal regime of Mobuto Sese
Seko, the invasions of the 1990s and the subsequent peace talks, and
changes to the country’s constitution in 2006 to allow Joseph Kabila
to contest the election. 'In 2011, the US was one of the first
countries to recognize the results of the rigged elections..' Musavuli
said.

Three months later, the M23 uprising began. 'It is the same rebel
force over twenty years, with the same soldiers and the same
commanders, to serve the interests of Rwanda, which itself is a strong
US ally in the so-called War on Terror. And what are Rwanda’s
interests in the Congo- its land and its resources,' he added.

As such, 'the conflict in the DRC must not be seen as fighting between
a rebel group and the Congolese government.' This was reiterated by
activist and writer Claude Gatebuke, 'This is not an ordinary
rebellion. It is an invasion of the Congo by Rwanda and Uganda'"

Researcher Kambale Musavuli: "[In Congo the killing civilians by
groups such as M23] is a tactic of displacement. Whenever you are
massacring civilians in public.. those things are to terrorize the
population. When it happens in your community tomorrow you are not
going to be in the same area because you are afraid. We have mass
displacement over [about] five million internally displaced
Congolose..  [and right after ppl leave a place] you see development
of mining concessions in that same area. Not only that, there is the
dispossession of land" \#AlJazeera

I guarantee it during the short-lived bizarre attempt, centers of
responsibility in the West were shitting in their pants... 'Whats
gonna happen? What if someone crazy gets hold of the nukes? (they
already know Putin isn't)'. Nothing was going to happen, political
adversaries routinely get poisoned in Russia, they would have nuked
this stupid son of a bitch... But still the events gave people
scare. It all goes to prove the more this needless war lasts, the more
pain everyone will suffer. The people who triggered the non-sense need
to understand, this ain't like 2013 stirring little shit up in Ukraine
can "change" some stuff... It already changed for the worse thanks to
you. This clusterfuck is your fault. Time for a fix?

---

Wagner soldiers being more integrated into RU mil acting less like a
private company can be useful for Russian efforts in Ukraine (to the
chagrin of Ukraine). Privatization can pollute gov organizations.

Was the Iraq War partly done for Haliburton (former CEO was VP)? Does
the gov today get good advice from SecDef on Ukraine, not encouraging
towards continued fighting? More war would mean more profits for
Rayteon of which the Secretary was a former board member? Makes you
wonder.

*War Dogs* has some psyop in it.. Its main characters were small
contractors for the US military, the movie essentially said "see even
the little guy benefits from the wars somehow". At the same time they
were made to look like jackasses, so by the end you are probably
thinking "mil is probably better off with the big defense
contractors". Mission accomplished.

"As indicated in the [table..] the biggest financial beneficiaries of
the post-9/11 military spending surge have been major U.S.-based
weapons contractors.

<img width='340' src='milspend1.jpg'/> 

But weapons makers were far from the only beneficiaries. Companies
benefiting from the buildup of the past 20 years range from weapons
manufacturers like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, to logistics and
reconstruction firms like Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) and Bechtel,
to armed private security contractors like Blackwater and Dyncorp. As
noted by Heidi Peltier in her analysis of the “camo economy,” roughly
half of the Pentagon budget—$370 billion in 2019 — went to military
contractors, for both war-related and ongoing peacetime activities"
