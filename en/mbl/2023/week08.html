<p>"Norway produces 50% of 'energy' with hydropower!!". When you look
closely it is electricity, not just "energy" and elec consump is at
20%. So now the number goes down to 10% - for a country of 5 million ;)
Is this supposed to impress someone?</p>
<hr />
<p>Of overall <em>energy</em> the percentage is actually &lt;4%. Electricity does
not represent all energy consumption (a mere 15% in most
countries). That is why most rosy renewable energy numbers are also
false eg Germany, Norway</p>

<p>It looks like generating things that can be interpreted one way or
another problem (some might call that art) was solved earlier by today's
crude attempts at AI.. Didn't scifi shows and movies have us believe

hard to make jokes, create paintings after demonstrating excellent
abilities in strong AI, feats today's algorithms can't even touch. I
guess the only thing the super duper android from 24th century had to
do was use some shit neural network code from 21st century, shove
bunch of data in there, and let it "generate art" for him.</p>

<p>David Mumford (Fields medal winner) started some work around the
mathematics of intelligence, pattern recognition, in a book on what he
calls "pattern theory"; this direction needs to be explored further
IMO. </p>
<hr />
<p>Mainstream "AI" research is moving in a completely wrong
direction. They need to change direction, fix how they conduct the
science.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is a term in FD formulas that says 'if there is a pressure
difference between two regions there will be a force between those
regions, from high to low' for example. This is the type of formula
AI, or AGI needs, not "neurons". Observe external variables (via
experiments, trial/error), then using mathematics create releations
among them. AGI needs to follow the same approach adopted by nearly
all natural sciences. What are the variables of intelligence? What is
the Calculus that can bind them together? These need to be
invented. It isn't about "computation", not at first, brogrammers are
slow to grasp this..  It's about declarative, broad relations, finding
the ever-present pattern among them, like making a cat's
cradle. Starting with one set of relations, transforming it another,
it goes on.. Then as a <em>last</em> step, you can compute.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is a fluid dynamics <em>formula</em> that works for any point in space,
point in time, at macro level.. We "discretize" that formula, chop it
up into pieces for computation and program that into the computer,
much later. This is a different approach from using micro particles
trying to build up to a system. As with many other things bottom up
approach doesn't work, top-down design is necessary. High
organization / design matters.</p>
<hr />
<p>We don't simulate fluids with particles</p>
<p>"[Deep] neural nets will give us true AI, intelligence is all about
neurons, if we can simulate enough neurons we can simulate the brain,
just like simulating water with many (water) particles"</p>

group of scientists, studying hints from seeps, mines, and abandoned

large stores of natural hydrogen may exist all over the world, like
oil and gas—but not in the same places. These researchers say
water-rock reactions deep within the Earth continuously generate
hydrogen, which percolates up through the crust and sometimes
accumulates in underground traps. There might be enough natural
hydrogen to meet burgeoning global demand for thousands of years,

in October 2022 at a meeting of the Geological Society of America"</p>

<p>But there might be more to mull over here.. A theologian once said
'every prophet worked as a shephard at least once in their
lives'.. I'd made a connection back then with them gaining people
management skills through the work (people are sheep), but this
pastoral people business brings in a new angle; were prophets
temperamentally pastoral but peaceful who wanted to be left alone by
the plundering farmer-slave state, then created a space for themselves
and like-minded others through a religious ideology?</p>
