<hr />
<p>Andersen: "[Economist] James Tobin... described financial
professionals' suddenly ballooning pay as 'high private rewards
disproportionate to social productivity' ..</p>
<p>It’s ironic that just as we entered an economic era all about
eliminating inessential middlemen and corporate bloat, one bloated
sector filled with inessential middlemen, finance, has flourished as
never before.</p>
<p>It’s ironic that one of the rationales for America’s 1980s makeover
was to revive the heroic American tradition of risk-taking—given that
so much of the story has turned out to be about reckless financiers
insulating themselves from risk by shifting it to customers and,
through the government, to taxpayers.</p>
<p>It’s ironic that finance, a service industry created to help business
and the rest of us, so bubbly and booming on and on these last four
decades, has mainly helped itself. 'There is no clear evidence,' the
chief financial industry regulator of the U.K. and former
vice-chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe concluded in 2010, 'that the
growth in the scale and complexity of the financial system in the rich
developed world over the last 20 to 30 years has driven increased
growth or stability'"</p>
<hr />
<p>Andersen, <em>Evil Geniuses</em>: ".. The final piece of financialization
comes from the enormous growth of the so-called institutional
investors, in particular mutual funds. Owning a share of stock isn’t
the same as being a citizen of a corporate domain, but stock ownership
used to be much more directly democratic, and the finance industry
didn’t run the show... By the 2000s, most stock shares were being
bought and sold by professional asset managers. The several biggest
mutual funds are now the majority shareholders of 90 percent of the
four hundred biggest companies, and such institutional investors
control 80 percent of all the stock in all U.S. public companies...  ​
Mutual fund companies are reincarnated equivalents of the excessively
powerful trusts that made us enact antitrust laws in the first
place. Economists and others across the ideological spectrum now worry
about the effects of this new stratum of command and control. Because
mutual funds have controlling interests in the big dominant
competitors in almost every major business—food, drugs, airlines,
telecommunications, banking, seeds, whatever—they aren’t naturally
inclined to make those rival companies compete aggressively against
one another"</p>

the war, [Stalin] assumed an exceedingly moderate posture... His
nation had lost 25 million people in the war, was desperately in need
of aid for rebuilding, and continued for a long time to nurture hopes
of coexistence.. Evidence thus clearly suggests that the U.S. policy
makers built the gigantic military-industrial complex not out of any
genuine fear of Soviet military attack but out of other motives. Top
among those motives, as pointed out earlier, was to establish a
U.S.-led world capitalist order in which unhindered market forces
would flourish, a world no part of which would be excluded from the
free flow of trade and investment"</p>

fiction'. The news cycle is currently dominated by hype about
artificial intelligence (a gross mis-characterisation of machine
learning algorithms and large language models). A couple of years ago
it was breathless hype about cryptocurrency and blockchain

<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "Frightened by the specter of peace and/or peace
dividends [after the fall of the Berlin Wall], beneficiaries of
military spending frantically sought to invent and substitute 'new
threats' for the 'communist threat' of the Cold War era, thereby
preempting the realization of peace dividends.</p>
<p>In pursuit of this goal, beneficiaries of war and militarism found a
strong, well-established network of politically savvy allies: radical
Zionist proponents of 'greater Israel.' Because the interests of these
two powerful groups converged over fomenting war and political
convulsion in the Middle East, an ominously potent alliance was forged
between them— ominous, because the mighty U.S. war machine was now
supplemented by the almost unrivaled public relations capabilities of
the hard-line pro-Israel lobby in the United States. The alliance is
unofficial and de facto; it is subtly forged through an elaborate
network of powerful militaristic think tanks"</p>
