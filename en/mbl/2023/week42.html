<hr />
<p>TechXplore: "New system to harness 40% of the sun's heat to produce
clean hydrogen fuel..  In a study published today in <em>Solar Energy</em>,
[MIT] engineers lay out the conceptual design for a system that can
efficiently produce "solar thermochemical hydrogen." The system
harnesses the sun's heat to directly split water and generate
hydrogen..</p>
<p>At the heart of a conceptual STCH system is a two-step thermochemical
reaction. In the first step, water in the form of steam is exposed to
a metal. This causes the metal to grab oxygen from steam, leaving
hydrogen behind. This metal "oxidation" is similar to the rusting of
iron in the presence of water, but it occurs much faster. Once
hydrogen is separated, the oxidized (or rusted) metal is reheated in a
vacuum, which acts to reverse the rusting process and regenerate the
metal. With the oxygen removed, the metal can be cooled and exposed to
steam again to produce more hydrogen. This process can be repeated
hundreds of times.</p>
<p>The MIT system is designed to optimize this process. The system as a
whole resembles a train of box-shaped reactors running on a circular
track. In practice, this track would be set around a solar thermal
source, such as a CSP tower. Each reactor in the train would house the
metal that undergoes the redox, or reversible rusting, process.</p>
<p><img width='340' src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wJiyig7pRLIOXshh4reO28UKBRey_efc'/> </p>
<p>Each reactor would first pass through a hot station, where it would be
exposed to the sun's heat at temperatures of up to 1,500°C. This
extreme heat would effectively pull oxygen out of a reactor's
metal. That metal would then be in a "reduced" state—ready to grab
oxygen from steam. For this to happen, the reactor would move to a
cooler station at temperatures around 1,000°C, where it would be
exposed to steam to produce hydrogen"</p>

<p>NYT: "[Khalidi] Israel has ordered more than a million people to leave
northern Gaza, presumably to prepare for an imminent ground
offensive. Its military strategists appear to be planning the
depopulation and reoccupation of at least part of an area home to
around 2.3 million people — nearly half of them children — and most of
them descended from people driven from their homes before and during
the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. We must understand that these are human
beings at grave risk, not just numbers. Consider what some in the
Israeli defense establishment have said. 'The State of Israel has no
choice but to turn Gaza into a place that is temporarily or
permanently impossible to live in,' a reservist major general, Giora
Eiland, wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper. 'Creating a
severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieve the
goal.'  He added, 'Gaza will become a place where no human being can
exist.'  Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, 'We are fighting human
animals, and we are acting accordingly.' Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian
declared that in Gaza, 'there will be no electricity and no
water. There will only be destruction. You wanted hell; you will get
hell. 'The depopulation of Gaza would be manifestly inhumane and a
violation of international law. President Biden and his advisers
should ask themselves how it can be in the national interest of the
United States to allow another mass expulsion of Palestinians from
their homes. Such a cataclysm would be a second nakba, or catastrophe,
as the displacement of 1948 is called"</p>

Kennedy announced that he would run not as a Democrat against Biden

running against Hannity’s friend Donald Trump. It also may mean
pulling more support from Trump than from Biden, which is very much

<p>Mitchell Baker from Mozilla tells the German news agency that we

criticizing tech giants. Great. But it accepts the tech-giants'
narrative: That 'AI' is inevitable and that all data <em>has to</em> be
dumped into these systems, that unfairness is a tech issue to solve
with more data. That is not true.</p>
<p>We can also decide not to build these huge and wasteful statistical
systems.</p>
<p>Sure there are useful machine learning tools, I spend parts of my day
building some, but these overreaching, all-encompassing, general
models are a mistake. They promise things that they'll never deliver,
are untestable, unverifiable, massively wasteful, express systemic
violence (and all the other structural issues [Timnit Gebru, Margaret

<p>Vox: "Why Biden’s multibillion-dollar bet on hydrogen energy is such a
big deal.. The federal funding is just a start. The Biden
administration hopes these projects attract another $40 billion in
private investment. And generous government subsidies earmarked in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act are
aimed at providing the private sector with the incentive to boost not
only the production of hydrogen but also the demand for it..</p>
<p>So the Biden administration has an unusual opportunity to set the
contours of how clean the hydrogen really becomes. The newly announced
hydrogen hubs are just the first step in a multiyear,
multibillion-dollar road. The government is essentially propping up a
nascent industry, but with that massive support comes an opportunity
to set the terms of an industry right..</p>
<p>Biden’s recent $7 billion announcement, it deserves to be said, is a
major one. It reveals the broad blueprint the Department of Energy
intends to follow to build an entire energy industry almost from
scratch. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law gave the department 8
billion to develop both supply and demand for hydrogen — the other 1
billion dollars will be used for supporting demand — and now we know
some details about how it will spend the vast majority of that on the
projects the DOE has prioritized"</p>

<p>The Rep nominee, most likely DJT, will have a chance but Biden, even
with -15% net approval rating at 2% QoQ GDP growth has the
advantage. Elections are about the incumbents. The first-term
incumbent (party) for prez almost never loses. HW lost but that was
GOP's third term, the party affiliation (and fatigue) transfered onto
him. For Dems 2024 this is not the case. Only at lower GDP, eg 0%
growth, the challenger would have the upper hand. If the backdrop
stays the same the race will be a tough one on the Reps, even for
Trump.</p>
