Expert: "Copper shortage getting real.. Along with the usual
applications, in construction wiring and plumbing, transportation,

Battery-electric tech and the electrification goal in general is an
extremely bad idea; relies heavily on a fragile, non-scalable tech
whose base input is [limited](../../2022/11/battery-electric.html#reserves).

"I wondered, who else out there had envisioned a smartphone back in
the day [with n]o store, no cloud, no company tracking everything you
do and every call you make? In early 2014, Blackberry was
faltering. Microsoft phones didn't solve that problem. I thought back
to the phones I had once known and loved, and settled on Nokia. And it
turned out they did! They did build a smartphone!

The Nokia N9 was absolutely gorgeous (still is), completely enchanting
and amazing, and fully functional. It won design awards right and
left. It ran using Linux, so people who wanted to give it commands
like a little computer could go right ahead. A far cry from the walled
garden of Apple, or the user interfaces that controlled what you could
and could not do on your own phone.

But it was late to market. Nokia sold to Microsoft, Microsoft canned
the project, and that might have been the end of the story...

<img width="340" src="https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/5/responsive/N9-copy-md.jpg"/>

... except that the people who designed this beauty's operating system
took the IP, started a new Finnish company called Jolla, and kept
working on it to build a new generation of phones with the same
concept, now called the Sailfish operating system. Data ownership,
autonomy, no walled gardens, gesture-based interfaces, the works.

Meanwhile, the people who used the phone loved it so much that they
wrote entire libraries of code to keep it working. In other words,
they built their own app store. They rescripted the phone so it could
talk to upgraded network towers.  And when Sailfish came out, many of
them started using Sailfish too, helping the community to grow and the
company to iron out the bugs"

Sailfish - could it be the third alternative mobile OS, after Android
and iPhone?

New Atlas: "China launches 100-mph hydrogen/supercapacitor train.. The
world's largest rail vehicle manufacturer has rolled out a
zero-emissions train running on hydrogen fuel cells with a
supercapacitor buffer. The four-car train is capable of 100 mph (160

CNBC: "[T]he CEO of energy firm AES offered up his take
[on natgas and H2] 'Now, what we can start to do today is … start to
blend it with green hydrogen... we’re running tests that you can blend
it up to, say 20%, in existing turbines, and new turbines are coming out
that can burn …  much higher percentages'"

In the previous Iraq map the weird borders on the upper right are not
a mapping error; there truly is an isolated bizarre little region
Nakhchivan that is part of Azerbaijan at the same time not connected
[to it](https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p08kf7w6.jpg). Armenia
divides them both; you think 'ARM can cut off transport btw
the two countries at will' and they did that once back in 1988.
As a result, [this post](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200721-nakhchivan-the-worlds-most-sustainable-nation)
says, Nakhchivan became more self-reliant etc etc. What a strange
history and associated borders.

Germany will join the new hydrogen pipeline project between Spain,
Portugal and France. The project, called H2Med, will connect Portugal
and Spain with France and now Germany to supply about two million tons
of hydrogen annually, or about 10% of the European Union's hydrogen
demand, by 2030" via Deutsche Welle

TR nemesis Kurdish PKK and sister org YPG are closer to PUK - one
Talabani made a visit to Rojova (YPG stronghold in NE Syria). Barzanis
are seen as too close to Ankara, as their poodle (which makes them the
poodle to poodle's poodle).

---

KRG, Iraqi central gov also have conflicts; after KRG 2017 indep
referandum central gov attacked KRG, took 20% of its land including
Kirkuk - major oil production center.

The loss of Kirkuk then became a PUK-KDP sore spot; PUK reportedly
left the fight, KDP was gung-ho, and lost. Major loss of face for KRG
especially KDP. Papa Barzani resigned after that one.

---

Iraq Kurdish map again; two families Barzani / Talabani are feuding,
one is based at Erbil the other at Suleymaniah, + sign is Kirkuk.

TASS: "The West may be heading for 'a catastrophic stalemate,' at
best, for Ukraine, Sherelle Jacobs, head of the Online Comment at The
Daily Telegraph, wrote on Monday night.

She views a decisive Russian breakthrough in spring as an alternative
scenario. According to her, while Western elites assume that a victory
for the Ukrainians 'must surely be around the corner,' the fact is
that Ukraine is increasingly on the back foot"

If such a win *did* occur BTW the Russian state would cease to exist -
and that's not going to happen.

It would be very difficult in the following year, or the one after
that as well..

AU is a good scientist; I agree with his general stance on how

H2 Central: "Alkaline Fuel Cell Power Corp Announces Prototype Launch
of Jupiter 1.0, a Powerful Fuel Cell System for Homes and Small
Buildings..

The planet Jupiter is made up of roughly 90% hydrogen, and similarly,
this PWWR fuel cell converts hydrogen to heat and electricity at
approximately 90% efficiency. Jupiter 1.0 is built to supply power
during peak demand periods and serves as a back-up when required for
homes and small buildings...

Jupiter 1.0, requires fewer components compared to conventional fuel
cells and also eliminates the need for expensive, precious metals"

We could gauge the effectiveness of the vax (and the system delivering
it) using the 1% method. Deaths in US are 1.11 million, `1.11 /
(330*0.01)` equals 0.33 meaning 67% effectiveness.

Will Dr. Luigi go on trial for possibly triggering this pandemic?

Some nasty effin thing this virus is..

---

That would be the optimistic scenario, a lower bound. If we
[assume](../../2020/02/corona.html) overall mortality rate of 1%, the
outcome could reach over 10 million. Assume with an half effective
vax, the final number could be at about 5 mil.

- 60% of clothes are made from synthetic fabrics derived from fossil fuels.

Obviously, mining as a means to encourage server availability was an
obscenely stupid idea caused waste of precious energy.

---

Open social media can provide the backdrop for fantastic net-centric
apps to be developed. Bitcoin bribed miners with mined money reward so
their machines provided other services to users. OSM servers are
already available for socmed purposes anyway, will probably outnumber
miner machines pretty soon, and on that processing power many services
can be built.. Digital currency is only one example.
