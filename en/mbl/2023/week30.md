# Week 30

"Second French Plan for Open Science.. Open science refers to the
unhindered dissemination of results, methods and products from
scientific research. It draws on the opportunity provided by recent
digital progress to develop open access to publications and – as much
as possible – data, source code and research methods... The French
Plan for Open Science has provided France with a coherent and dynamic
policy in the field of open science. It was announced in 2018 by the
Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, Frédérique
Vidal, and is coordinated by the Committee for Open Science, which
brings together the Ministry, the universities and research performing
organizations and the scientific community. Substantial progress has
been made in the three years since this policy was introduced. The
percentage of open access scientific publications in France has risen
from 41% to 56%"

Paper: "Replacing traditional journals with a more modern solution is
not a new idea. Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma
underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only
resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing
takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals
with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is
interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the
governance of the scholarly community."

250 bucks.. let's be nice now.. dont wanna bankrupt these "value creators"
they give so much to society

Gizmodo: "Earlier in the week, NBCUniversal drew controversy when it
suddenly up and pruned a bunch of shade trees in front of its lot. Up
until then, those trees were being used by striking writers and actors
as shade during their picketing, because it’s been really hot in Los
Angeles lately. To see them cut down felt like a very deliberate move
against picketers, even as Universal insisted it was nothing more than
a not-so-happy coincidence... LA’s City Controller Kenneth
Mejia.. said that StreetsLA would issue a fine of $250 to the
corporation for the violation of cutting trees without a city permit"

But even when they agreed on 'freedoms', anti-gov views, neither side
liked what those freedoms would entail, unleash on the other side. The
economic right could not stand the socially permissive ways of the
cultural left, who in turn could not stand some freedoms the right
practiced such as guns, and the lax atitude towards the
environment. But that was okay - that dislike could subtitute for
politics now - everyone could argue until they were blue in the face
that never amounted to much change since the 'superstructure'
underneath that allowed it was set in stone. But argument, upon
argument, hack against hack were piled on.. It made a festive
party. In the process due to natural cycles there would be ups and
downs, some ppl would drop out of office, some get in, some would get
awarded, some get rich, even minorities would get to 'represent'..  it
could look like forward momentum, advance, for a while it looked like
things were getting better (but they were not)

---

What do you get as the result of economic right's [grand
bargain](../../2023/06/evil-geniuses.html#bargain) with cultural left? The
Woke ideology. The masses were permitted to increase their
"self-expressive urges" (some took it to its natural conclusion and
became Woke) capitalists in return were also unshackled in their own
ways and formed today's business class, some bought guns. They are
different sides of the same coin.

Pattinson from *Tenet* also played another version of the jagoff

After making three movies about a jagoff billionaire, on *Tenet* his
ultimate goal seemed to be to bore with maniacal detail (built on
baseless science) but he truly gets you with the backdrop where it is
indirectly suggested "some people in gov can be doing some scary shit
and you should be scared of that shit". *Oppenheimer* is similar -
this is the story of the atomic bomb after all. But a-bomb cannot ever
be used due to M.A.D. whereas the private sector freely kills people
pollutes the environment churning out shit product (much like Nolan's
movies) constantly, annually. What I am wondering is when is this guy
going to make a movie about toxic spills, theft, fraud that takes

This means massive amount of money lost for the California public

The Mercury News: "Built-in software ‘death dates’ are sending

software death date baked into each model, older versions of these
inexpensive computers are set to expire three to six years after their
release. Despite having fully functioning hardware, an expired
Chromebook will no longer receive the software updates it needs,
blocking basic websites and applications from use...

Chromebook sales soared after the start of the pandemic in 2020. More
affordable than traditional laptops, the devices were seen as a way to
connect students to their classes without breaking the bank — and
across the country, school districts ordered them in droves... But
three years later, thousands of those laptops have already been
rendered useless... Oakland is not alone. In Southern California, the
Torrance Unified School District will lay to rest more than 20,000
Chromebooks"

Researcher Bjarnason: "One of the issues.. that has perplexed me—has
been that many people are convinced that language models, or
specifically chat-based language models, are intelligent. But there
isn’t any mechanism inherent in large language models (LLMs) that
would seem to enable this..

LLMs are not brains and do not meaningfully share any of the
mechanisms that animals or people use to reason or think. LLMs are a
mathematical model of language tokens. You give a LLM text, and it
will give you a mathematically plausible response to that text. There
is no reason to believe that it thinks or reasons..

The intelligence illusion seems to be based on the same mechanism as
that of a psychic’s con, often called cold reading. It looks like an
accidental automation of the same basic tactic. By using validation
statements, such as sentences that use the Forer effect, the chatbot
and the psychic both give the impression of being able to make
extremely specific answers, but those answers are in fact
statistically generic"

I sometimes hear people make fun of the fact that Berlin has a huge
empty field right in its core area where Tempelhof airport used to
operate which is now a public park and left almost entirely unchanged,
runways and all. They talk about it as if it's an example of the
city's inability to do something 'useful' with this land. And what
they mean is build stuff on it.

But just the way it is, it is hugely popular among the people of
Berlin, it's a unique space where the sheer size of it enables anyone
to basically do whatever without annoying anyone else. Even at peak
times like Saturday afternoon, it still doesn't feel crowded and the
further away from the edges you go the emptier it gets. It refuses any
commercial 'usefulness' and instead gives people space to use how they
see fit. It's absolutely beautiful"

LA Times: "[Netflix's] ambitions were hypercharged by a newfangled
sense that it could disrupt the old school Hollywood industry and
scale endlessly.. As with Uber and Lyft, whose bottomless chests of
venture capital allowed them to conquer new markets once dominated by
stodgy old competitors.. [but] Netflix et al. adopted another key
ingredient of Silicon Valley’s approach: secrecy. Data about shows’
performance and viewer habits were kept proprietary; we knew only what
the streamers wanted us to know...

It’s a sticking point in the negotiations — actors and writers on
streaming series want a better way to calculate the value of their
work, given that the residuals they earn are so much lower than for
network or cable shows. The studios have resisted. 'The reason nobody
really wants to open the books on this is because if Wall Street got a
look,' one Hollywood insider told New York Magazine, 'they’d have a
collective stroke.'..

The boom times are over. Executives know it. Wall Street knows it. And
the story that we’re in a revolutionary moment of technological
transformation will run out of gas soon. So the bosses are using that
moment to do what Silicon Valley wound up doing when its other big
swings didn’t pan out: squeeze labor"

TDB: "'When will it get too hot for normal daily activity as we know
it, even for young, healthy adults?'... The answer goes beyond the
temperature you see on the thermometer. It’s also about humidity. Our
research is designed to come up with the combination of the two,
measured as “wet-bulb temperature.”.. a study published in 2010..
theorized that a wet-bulb temperature of 95 F (35 C)—equal to a
temperature of 95 F at 100% humidity, or 115 F at 50% humidity – would
be the upper limit of safety... Our studies on young healthy men and
women show that this upper environmental limit is even lower than the
theorized 35 C. It occurs at a wet-bulb temperature of about 87 F (31
C)"

Dessler: "Cherry picking is a tactic where someone selectively chooses

contrarians are focusing on when they argue that the 1930s had worse
heat waves. Obviously, focusing on that one region gives a deeply

Neural net "AI" gets beaten by simple compression 😂

"'Low-Resource' Text Classification.. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are
often used for text classification.. However, DNNs can be
computationally intensive, requiring millions of parameters and large
amounts of labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to
optimize, and to transfer to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in
practice. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric alternative to
DNNs that’s easy, lightweight, and universal in text classification: a
combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a k-nearest-neighbor
classifier. Without any training parameters, our method achieves
results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep learning methods
on six in-distribution datasets"

their billionaire into it (B. Wayne) and tried to rearrange things
around him (and failed), we also know Snyder's plan for Supes was that
he'd eventually turn evil. The new DCU tone sounds different; Clark
Kent is small town, rural type of person anyway, not a bilionaire
jagoff, meaning the reboot will be centered around more relatable
characters. Even their reimagined Bats sounds like will be more human
than before.

Axios: "There's no safe port in a changing climate. Americans who move
from one region to another are increasingly citing climate change as
at least one driving factor.. Yet nowhere is truly safe from extreme
weather, some of which is fueled by climate change... Case in point:
The recent catastrophic flooding in Vermont, a state that often ranks
high on lists of so-called 'climate havens.'"
