H2 Fuel News: "MIT and DMI to develop first open-source hydrogen fuel
cell powered motorcycle.. The MIT EVT hopes that the hydrogen fuel
cell motorcycle development will help to overcome a range of
challenges associated with BEVs while addressing concerns regarding
shortages and environmental issues associated with lithium mining

H2 View: "US multinational Honeywell announced its new Liquid Organic
Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) solution to enable the long-distance
transportation of clean hydrogen. The Global Hydrogen Flows report
predicted that of the 660 million tonnes of hydrogen needed to meet
global Net Zero by 2050, 400 million are expected to be transported
over long-distances, with 190 million tonnes set to cross
international borders"

Culture does not care about how it is labeled.. it will be transmited
via osmosis, people-to-people, one-on-one through the land and its
people no matter what. Cannot change your culture by labeling it
differently, or by wearing funky hats, telling stories or following
rituals. The duty of an intelligentia is to pinpoint this fact, argue
around the true source of culture, lest be responsible for generating
neurotic behavior in their students.

---

Herodotus was eating yoghurt in 800 BC; he didn't need some punk from
Asia riding in on a donkey to teach him about it (who hadn't even
arrived by then, that would be a thousand years later). 

---

Turks arriving into Anatolia were assimilated, they melted away
culturally and genetically. 1920s TR nationalization, "Turkification"
merely performed a labeling trick. The founders wanted to create
historical amnesia so they picked an exotic, irrelevant ethnicity
(somewhat innocuous meaning simply Muslim as most founders were from
the Balkans), and everyone in Anatolia were rebranded. Muslims were
transitioned, history was rewritten so that all culture before "the
arrival" was made to look like was brought by that irrelevant group,
not pre-existing before their arrival. This is how Byzantian music
became 'Turkish art music", Greek/Balkan/Arab food became "Turkish
food", and Yemenese coffee became "Turkish coffee".

---

Therein lies the fallacy of the "we need more younger workers to
support older population" argument.. Would more "young people" going
into soft drink industry generate value, real benefits, in the long
run? The problem is money creation is too tied to businesses (as
credit), it needs to be tied in large part to salaries (which can
later become credit).

---

Money, credit generated for this business segment is for useless
production. Zero benefit for the humankind.

Statista: "Revenue in the Soft Drinks segment amounts to US$0.85tn in 2023"

Crowd Wisdom works only for subjects the crowd has an expertise in eg
gauging the general acceptability of politician as leader, or guessing
the weight of an ox. That sort of judgement is likely ingrained;
averaging can lead to better results. But even that fails sometimes,
remember 1960 or 2000.

H2 Insight: "An Anglo-Spanish company says it could produce naturally

imply less inflation, meaning less risk for bonds, so they buy bonds,
their price rises, yields fall. Simple.

German investment company, Conjuncta, along with the United Arab

firm Infinity have signed an agreement with the Mauritanian government
to build a 34 billion green hydrogen plant with an electrolyzer
capacity of up to 10 gigawatts near the Mauritanian capital,
Nouakchott. Every year, the green hydrogen plant will produce 8
million tonnes of ammonia or other hydrogen-based products along with
green hydrogen. The plant’s first phase will be going to be completed
by 2028 with a planned capacity of 400 megawatts"

Keynes' idea for a world currency [Bancor](../../0119/2019/06/bancor.html)
did not use gold either.

---

Some news suggest the new BRICS currency could be backed by gold; if
true gold would be there to provide convertibility assurance to
non-BRICS currencies. A global, dominant currency does not need gold -
Nixon's petrodollar did not need it, he was like I have my military
and an agreement with the top oil producer to keep it legit.

If the abortion issue was so important Dems could've codified Roe in
law with 2009-10 supermajority. They didn't because it was better to
exploit the issue firing up the donor base taking their money rather
than solving the problem. It's still the Dick Morris [plan](../../2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation),
on major issues it is uniparty, for others manufactured heated "debates",
schisms, abt "5G" issues - Guns Gays Gender God Green.

Chomsky: "[NYT Opinion] The False Promise of ChatGPT.. OpenAI’s
ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Sydney..  have been hailed as
the first glimmers on the horizon of artificial general intelligence —
that long-prophesied moment when mechanical minds surpass human
brains.. That day may come, but its dawn is not yet breaking.. [as
long as] machine learning programs like ChatGPT continue to dominate
the field of A.I...

The human mind is not, like ChatGPT and its ilk, a lumbering
statistical engine for pattern matching, gorging on hundreds of
terabytes of data and extrapolating the most likely conversational
response or most probable answer to a scientific question. On the
contrary, the human mind is a surprisingly efficient and even elegant
system that operates with small amounts of information; it seeks not
to infer brute correlations among data points but to create
explanations..

It summarizes the standard arguments in the literature by a kind of
super-autocomplete.. In short, ChatGPT and its brethren are
constitutionally unable to balance creativity with constraint. They
either overgenerate (producing both truths and falsehoods, endorsing
ethical and unethical decisions alike) or undergenerate (exhibiting
noncommitment to any decisions and indifference to
consequences). Given the amorality, faux science and linguistic
incompetence of these systems, we can only laugh or cry at their
popularity"

Bakhmut became strategically key, both due to its location (at a
gateway to the rest of Donbas), also bcz Ukraine decided to take a
stand there and *make* it important. Looking at its topo I can see why - 
has two funky mountain systems going into it from South, and another
ranging along its West. Surely UA exploited that structure to set up
staggered defense lines, and delayed RU for as long as they could. But
it looks like the game is nearing its end.

A lot of ignorant people are commenting on things they don't fully understand.

"@timnitGebru@dair-community.social

Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

At least WH is owning up to a good decision to pull out from AFG when
it did. But it is possible WH was way too embarrassed about the
situation earlier, and went cowboy with Ukraine to offset it, to "show
strength", also trying to deter "certain countries" who might get
funky ideas later. That did not work too well for Ukraine.

When it was on, the game was great. You could even do variations; you
could say "Democrats and Republicans need to come together" even when
the schisms they experienced were manufactured and subpar, but the uniter
narrative offered some brownie points.. You could pretend to [hate the game](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1r8wAGwhOmflPy0vCbbSEM0mSb16Ua7qF),

The gun issue *became* deadly of course due to neglect, in a sane
political discourse it could have been solved. Now it is hot-button
material, untouchable, member on each side need to be fanatical about it
to affirm their party allegiance. 

---

The establishment is dying to go back to that narrative (great for
ratings, makes politicians look like they are actually discussing
something, albeit second-rate, usually agreeable stuff). At the same
time both sides offer bipartisan support to a war that could be ended
in a day, letting a legit journalist rot in jail and healthcare issue
kept MIA. The guy who says he signed up to military to fight in
[useless wars](../../2023/03/isiah-james-iraq.html) because he was poor and
had no healthcare gets no traction. That shit is just too real - not
part of the plan.
