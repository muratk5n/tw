TechXplore: "A European consortium on Wednesday said it had in a world
first successfully tested a gas turbine fully powered by hydrogen,
opening the way to slashing carbon emissions in energy-intensive
industries like cement... French energy company Engie, the German

universities were part of the EU-funded consortium Hyflexpower that
carried out the test at a Smurfit Kappa paper packaging factory near
the French city of Limoges"

The busy bank of the Seine in Paris. This used to be space for cars,

that leadership was challenged"

The same directors did try later to make up for their mistake though,
partly in another movie - *Jupiter Rising*. The heroine was working
class (a cleaner girl who was 'special') and the bad people are an
intergalactic empire who 'own' Earth. Their dominance have Matrix-y
aspects, they can erase people's memories to make sure they are not
known but the control is not like Matrix level which symbolizes
government that every libertard should tremble in fear about whenever
they hear its name. The overlords of JR are of a feudal type and
mostly interested in humans as products, they want to harvest them and
become rich. So in essence they are capitalists, cornering their
markets, producing their products and above all, exploiting. 

---

After the first, the Wachowskis realized what they had done. They had
created a magnum opus, a *magnifique travail* for every anti-gov ultra
libertard fuckjob out there and they wanted to reel in some of their
"message".

II and III shows some easing of the boundaries between the humans and
"AI".  Smith gets something of Neo in him, who will later help the
machines survive.  The concept of The One is taken down a notch,
there've been others before. This way the "us against them" situation
if muddled, weakened, placed in the backburner if you will. If the
theme music of the first was Rob Zombie's *Dragula* the theme music
for the next two would be *Why Cant We Be Friends?* Corporatists after
all want gov off their case, beaten down, be their bitch, but they
dont want it completely gone. They want an entity to subsidize them,
socialize their losses, and act like a capitalist enabler when they
are making huge profits. All this libertard stuff is supposed to stay
at cosplay level, go buy some guns play the weekend warrior, act the
independent maverick type in your own little delusional sphere but
stay in the corporate ladder, and respect the markets. You are not
supposed to rock the boat, because these f--kers live on that
boat. They *are* the boat, this is the world in which they've already
won. There is no need to change that.

The first Matrix movie was anti-government pro-corporate propaganda.

NYT: "'[E]nmity toward Israel over its decades-long occupation of
their land' remained strong, particularly as Israel's government
expanded settlements in the Palestinian West Bank after the
agreements. On Saturday, when Palestinian gunmen from the blockaded
territory of Gaza surged into Israel, carrying out the boldest attack
in the country in decades, it set off an outpouring of support for the
Palestinians across the region. In some quarters, there were
celebrations even as hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians were
killed... Demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians took
place across the region, including in Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen,
Tunisia and Kuwait..

[I]n Egypt's coastal city of Alexandria, a policeman opened fire on
Israeli tourists, killing two Israelis and an Egyptian.The ripples
spreading from Gaza underscored what many officials, scholars and
citizens in the region have been saying for years: The Palestinian
cause is still a deeply felt rallying cry that shapes the contours of
the Middle East, and Israel's position in the region will remain
unstable as long as its conflict with the Palestinians continues"

tried to shut us down. We protest, 8000 people in the Great March of
Return [in Gaza], protested peacefully, we were shot at with live
ammunition. We go to social media, and advocate there, we get shut
out, silenced on social media. Every single avenue - international law
for instance, US will veto and shut that route down. All these
peaceful avenues are pursued by Palestinians and that is never good
enough. No form of resistance is good enough, it is only acceptable if
you are a dead Palestinian"

"@wilbr@glitch.social

'Israel's right to exist' is curious framing I hear often. If armed
water defenders broke out of an Indian Reservation and attacked a
nearby US town I wouldn't be talking about America's 'right to
exist.'.. Billions of dollars a year & millions of people say Israel
will continue existing in some form. The question is if Netanyahu's
government and policies should exist, and what equitable truth &
reconciliation would look like for Palestinians...

The idea that the only possible way to allow the victims of genocide
to survive is to just straight up give them the cities and houses of
Palestinians doesn't set up conditions for justice, and continued
blockading and encroachment ditching Palestine into smaller and more
impoverished areas with random (and daily) escalatory violence just
pours salt in the wound. The West created a messed up situation and
finances its right-wing government's activities. Arabs pay the price,
as we see so often"

NYT: "E-Bikes Are Convenient. They Can Also Cause Fatal Fires... Just
before midnight on a Friday in January, a fire tore through a
three-story house in East Elmhurst, Queens, injuring 10 people inside
and killing a 63-year-old man who was trapped on the second
floor. Five days later, on a rainy Wednesday afternoon, another fire
broke out in the basement of a house in Forest Hills, Queens, where an
unauthorized day care center was housed. Eighteen children were
injured, one seriously.

The cause of both fires was rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which
power the e-bikes and e-scooters that have become ubiquitous on city
streets.. [but] deadly, unintended consequence has emerged: Storing
and charging such bikes and scooters indoors can create a
tinderbox. Last year, the batteries caused 216 fires, with 147
injuries and six deaths. As of Feb. 27 this year, they were
responsible for 30 fires, 40 injuries and two deaths, according to the
Fire Department"
