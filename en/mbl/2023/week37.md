Batman presumably owns DC comics using a shell company.

Think about it.  They can't hide how Gotham is a hellscape with
massive wealth inequality and crumbling infrastructure.  But they
frame it as a rich heroic vigilante fighting a one-man war.  The
villains are almost never the ultra rich (other than Penguin, who is
more of a poseur).  Instead the criminals are frequently doctors,
lawyers, scientists, etc.

Most of his opponents keep escaping from Gotham Asylum.  But, instead
of raising taxes to improve its security and improving the
effectiveness of treatments, DC comics frames it so we're supposed to
cheer for the vigilante who roughs up the escaped mentally ill people
then returns them to the same underfunded asylum over and over"

Bitcoin being an energy hog is one of its many disadvantages. The most
important one is its limited money base - money base needs to expand,
otherwise you will get deflation. Some think this feature makes
bitcoin "politics free" bcz politicians "print and debase money" but
no money is politics free. Gold became currency because the king made
it so. It has no intrinsic moneyness attribute. Bitcoin is libertard
cosplay, that's all it is. AND a waste of energy.

Public sphere is overrun by private interests

The Atlantic: "America Has a Private-Beach Problem.. Accessing the
least-crowded section of New York’s Lido Beach requires either money
or insider knowledge. Anyone staying at one of the hotels on the beach
can walk through the lobby, and those living in the adjoining town can
waltz in through a separate gate using a residents-only electronic
access code. Everyone else, though, has to come in through a public
entrance half a mile away and walk over the sand. In theory, some
portion of every beach in the coastal United States is reserved for
collective use—even those that border private property. But exactly
how big that portion is varies widely, and in practice, much of the
shore is impenetrable"

Watching Greenland burn and Libya flood and France turn to desert,

I love my smart TV. I love the way it takes a long time to boot up
because it's trying to refresh the advertisements on the home
screen. I delight in the way it randomly restarts because it's
downloaded an update without asking me, each of which makes the TV
slower and slower with every subsequent install. I adore the way it
buries the apps that I want to use, and that I use without fail every
single time, below the apps that it's being paid to promote and which
I have never touched in my life and would never use without the cold
metal of a glock pressed hard against my sweating temple. I am
infinitely thrilled by the way the interface lags constantly, due to
the need to have one thousand unnecessary animations rendered on
hardware ripped wholesale from a ten year old phone. I feel myself
borne aloft on wings of pure joy when I am notified that my data will
be collected and analysed to determine my useage patterns. Even now I
am writing this from a field of beautiful flowers and soft luscious

Remember the scene in *Toy Story* where Buzz Lightyear jumps in air
wanting to fly, but with a succession of accidents stays in the air
for a while, and declares he is flying. Another toy says to him "you
are not flying, you are falling with style". That is precisely what's
going on with these neural net "AI" approaches, LLMs - they are
stupid, but they are stupid with style, their output sometimes looks
intelligent, either by chance (stochastically) or through a 
phenomenon known as [psychic's con](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist).

---

They are basically stupid

Melanie Mitchell: "Can Large Language Models Reason?.. [I]f LLMs rely
primarily on memorization and pattern-matching rather than true
reasoning, then they will not be generalizable—we can’t trust them to
perform well on 'out of distribution' tasks, those that are not
sufficiently similar to tasks they’ve seen in the training data...  If
LLMs Are Not Reasoning, What Are They Doing?..  Several researchers
have shown that LLMs are substantially better at solving problems that
involve terms or concepts that appear more frequently in their
training data, leading to the hypothesis that LLMs do not perform
robust abstract reasoning to solve problems, but instead solve
problems (at least in part) by identifying patterns in their training
data that match, or are similar to, or are otherwise related to the
text of the prompts they are given.

For example, a study by Razeghi et al. showed that some GPT-based LLMs
(pre-trained on a known corpus) were much better at arithmetic
problems that involved numbers that appeared frequently in the
pre-training corpus than those that appeared less frequently. These
models appear to lack a general ability for arithmetic, but instead
rely on a kind of “memorization”—matching patterns of text they have
seen in pre-training"

Schools clearly bet on the wrong technology - ed solutions need to be
based on true open architectures. DoEd can buy commodity hardware
(cheap as they will buying in bulk) and keep Ed software as "images"
on a DoEd server. Images are snapshots of a machine that has
everything kids need, you burn this image on each machine, give that
to students. A few visiting gov IT people for each school occasionally
can fix issues as they arise. Do not depend on some questionable
bidness "on the cloud".

"‘Chromebook Churn’ report highlights problems of short-lived laptops
in schools Chromebooks are not designed to last...Schools have piles
of working Chromebooks that have become e-waste because they’ve
expired...

Chromebooks have a built-in 'death date,' after which software support
ends. We expect milk to expire, but not laptops. Adding to customer
confusion, expiration dates are based on the certification of a given
model, not the purchase date. This means that consumers or schools can
buy a used or refurbished Chromebook thinking they’re getting a great
deal, only to be surprised when their new laptop expires after a year"

A lot can be done via static files, even big ones. Some do not realize
but client can even read *parts* of a file on the web server, it's part
of the standard,

```python
from requests import get
url = "http://download.thinkbroadband.com/5MB.zip"
get(url, headers={"Range": "bytes=0-100"})
```

That gets only first 100 bytes. In theory one could even read parts of
a whole database if client knew how to seek/jump between the right
parts of the db file.. This is for read-only apps sure, still,
covers a lot of ground.

---

No need for a whole app server to offer search, static files can work
too (this blog's setup). IDEA: Create a search index offline, push the
index files on the the static site, client, with its code, can read
specific parts of the index, combine, sort them, and present results
on its end.

We are talking about Chilean Air Force bombing the presidential
residence as part of a coup, photographed above. The date was
September 11, 1973, and the left-wing president Allende was
toppled. Pinochet would become president and usher in neo-liberal
reforms, jail opponents, opress political dissent. "Chicago Boys" were
asked to help, thanks to them, the new system would create inequality
and subsequently cause the 1982 monetary crisis.

September 11 for US was tragic too, but US reacted to it by telling
people "to shop more", and invaded a random country to benefit
Halliburton. Dare I say due to its actions US made its own 9/11 matter
less. From now on we will only commemorate the Chilean 9/11, not the
American one.
