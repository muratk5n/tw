<p><em>The Precariat</em>: "In the 1970s, a group of ideologically inspired
economists captured the ears and minds of politicians. The central
plank of their ‘neo-liberal’ model was that growth and development
depended on market competitiveness; everything should be done to
maximise competition and competitiveness, and to allow market
principles to permeate all aspects of life.</p>
<p>One theme was that countries should increase labour market
flexibility, which came to mean an agenda for transferring risks and
insecurity onto workers and their families. The result has been the
creation of a global ‘precariat’, consisting of many millions around
the world without an anchor of stability. They are becoming a new
dangerous class. They are prone to listen to ugly voices, and to use
their votes and money to give those voices a political platform of
increasing influence. The very success of the ‘neo-liberal’ agenda,
embraced to a greater or lesser extent by governments of all
complexions, has created an incipient political monster. Action is
needed before that monster comes to life"</p>

only learns its own minority culture not the whole. This is a foolish

<p>Happy Anzac Day bitchez! (Apparently it's on April 25th)</p>
<hr />
<p>Current Oz Labor gov is continuing the nuke sub deal AUKUS. A former
Labor leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/paul-keating-labels-aukus-submarine-pact-worst-deal-in-all-history-in-attack-on-albanese-government">criticized</a>
the decision as "the 'worst deal in all history', because [the same money] could
buy 40 to 50 conventional submarines instead". He says, correctly,
conv subs are more than sufficient to defend Australia from attacking
navies. But of course that's not the point of the nuke sub deal. Nuke
subs are needed for attacking China, in their turf, and that's the point,
AUKUS isn't about direct homeland defense, it is about offense. You are
going Galipoli again, in return for a superpower help, just like during WWI,
1915 when you attacked a people with whom "you never had an angry word with".</p>
<hr />
<p>The deaths of those soldiers did mean something, in strategic terms,
not in the way regular people understand war. Galipoli wasn't a case
of "I was attacked now I defend myself" it was a case of "I must
invade A who is part of alliance B because I need the protection of C
against some way distant future possibly invasion of X".</p>
<hr />
<p>Anzac support was due to a security / neutrality trade-off for Oz; you
offer your services, in location, in human lives, to a superpower
(Britain then, US now) to get "protection" in return. The reason for
the Anzac rememberence rituals are kept alive today is to remind
people a similar sacrifice might be asked of them again.</p>
<hr />
<p>When his Galipoli movie came out, Russell Crowe gave an interview, the
responses from people were interesting. Some were like 'Wut'? That is
a national narrative at work, they reside in subconcious, sit there as
unquestioned, banal conclusions. When questioned ppl are shocked.</p>

<p>There were New Zealanders in Anzac; the word is is an acronym for the

of history interests me obviously bcz Anzac were sent by Brits to
Galipoli attacking my hood.</p>

<p>Deng staked the success of economic reform on Western technology and
foreign investment, particularly from America. Deng’s acceptance of
U.S. terms during the establishment of diplomatic relations between
the two countries in mid-­December 1978 was crucial in achieving these
two strategic objectives both externally and internally... China’s
decision to launch a punitive war against Vietnam was intended to
display Beijing’s usefulness in countering Soviet expansionism. In
Deng’s own words, China was 'a reliable friend,' and it therefore
deserved Western economic and technological assistance"</p>
