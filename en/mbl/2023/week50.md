Business Standard: "Tata Motors became the country's first bus
manufacturer to receive the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR) type
approval certificate for its Hydrogen Fuel Cell powered (FCEV) buses.

The largest commercial vehicle manufacturer in India obtained the
approval for its Tata Starbus 4/12 FCEV model along with its

"[Researchers discovered] small ruthenium particles and a
solar-powered system for water electrolysis [can produce H2
efficiently]. This is the solution identified by a joint team
involving the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Italian Institute of
Technology, IIT) of Genoa, and BeDimensional S.p.A. (an IIT
spin-off). The technology, developed in the context of the Joint-lab’s
activities and recently published in two high-impact factor journals
(Nature Communications and the Journal of the American Chemical
Society) is based on a new family of electrocatalysts that could
reduce the costs of green hydrogen production on an industrial scale"

Semler: "Here.. is how the military-industrial complex siphons off
money from pro-worker programs — and how it sustains its enormous
political power.

- Redistributing Wealth Into For-profit Hands... Establishment
politicians like to describe the Pentagon budget as an investment in
the country’s security, but it’s better characterized as a massive
redistribution of wealth...

- Showering Politicians With Campaign Donations Contributions to
federal candidates from the arms industry tripled from the 2002 to
2020 election cycles. All told, military contractors shelled out a
whopping $283 million on candidates and political parties from 2001 to
2020...

- Underwriting Think Tanks Across the Political Spectrum.. Most of the
country’s major think tanks — from New America to the Brookings
Institution to the Center for a New American Security — receive
funding from military contractors.

- Providing Welfare Through Warfare.. The [MIC] among other things, is
a massive federal jobs program. Between the Pentagon and private
sector military contractors and subcontractors, the sector directly or
indirectly employs nearly four million people... All of those jobs and
benefits — carefully distributed across hundreds of congressional
districts — make Pentagon spending an immediate, tangible, material
concern for millions of people. In a country where the welfare state
is notoriously threadbare and an actual federal jobs program is
perpetually off the table, 'military Keynesianism' comes to be seen as
a more durable source of economic stability"

Paper: "We find that the UV surface brightness of luminous disk
galaxies are constant over a very wide redshift range (from z = 0.03
to z ~ 5). From this analysis we conclude that the Tolman test for
surface brightness dimming is consistent with a non-expanding,
Euclidean Universe with distance proportional to redshift. This
result is also consistent with previously published datasets that were
obtained to perform the Tolman test for a smaller redshift baseline
when analysis of such data is done in a consistent system"

function of their redshift.. Such a comparison was first proposed in
1930 by Richard C. Tolman as a test of whether the universe is
expanding or static"

"@FNB_Gas@mastodon.energy

Today Federal Minister Robert Habeck together with our CEO Dr. Thomas
Gößmann presented the draft of the #hydrogen core network. This puts #
Germany at the forefront of building the # hydrogen infrastructure in
Europe...

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlRTcjfcyNA)

Through the project by ONTRAS, Gascade and terranets bw, # H2 can be
transported from 2025...

New construction or conversion from natural gas to # hydrogen ?
Switching also means: faster implementation, lower costs, lower
consumption of resources. This is good for the economy and the
environment.

The #hydrogen core network will predominantly consist of converted
natural gas pipelines as well as new hydrogen pipelines to be built.

The #hydrogen core network does not only consist of TNB lines. It also
takes into account 710 km of lines from distribution system operators
and other pipeline system operators.

[Map](https://sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/cdn.mastodon.energy/media_attachments/files/111/414/482/649/824/129/original/f292e6332bbce3c4.png)

The @bundestag passed a comprehensive reform of the Energy Industry
Act (#EnWG) on November 10 , 2023 . It removes the main hurdles for
hydrogen network planning that resulted from the transitional
regulation for hydrogen networks.

The #hydrogen core network is to be financed entirely through network
fees. To achieve this, fees must be capped in the ramp-up phase...

The next big step towards the #hydrogen core network: FNB Gas presents
the draft of the core network"

Reuters: "[A] court ruling last month threw the [DE] government's
finances into disarray...The coalition has agreed to plug a

federal grants.

A climate and transformation fund, designed to support companies'
transition towards greener practices, will be reduced by 12 billion
euros in 2024 and by 45 billion euros in the financial planning up to
2027, although Scholz said the fund will still have a total volume of
160 billion euros"

Battery-electric tech is subpar, suboptimal, in terms of TCO it is a

needs would disqualify this tech from any widespread adoption.

Paper: "[W]hy does range anxiety exist for BEVs’ consumers? We guess
consumers’ range anxiety mainly comes from two aspects: First, one
cause of range anxiety could be that the real range of BEVs differs
greatly from the nominal AER announced by automotive
companies. Especially when the air conditioning is on, and the battery
performance decreases in winter, it results in a lower real range. For
example, the real range of BEVs is approximately 35%–40% lower than
the nominal range (at minus 7) in cold regions of China... The
second.. anxiety is charging anxiety. It is mainly due to the
imperfect charging infrastructure, consumers’ inability to find
charging piles in time, or charging time being too long, especially
when battery charging is not on the consumers’ schedule"

Latest neural net based approaches in their essence get one isolated
datapoint, and one label (prediction target) per training cycle
(batching can be done but that is an implementation trick). Truly
representing, using sequence has always been a problem for NNs. In one
approach you *cheat* by taking in enough pre-sequenced data as a
snapshot. One datapoint can have, eg "cat sat on the" which is paired
with label "mat". Then shift tokens one to the right in the bigger
sentence, next isolated datapoint is "sat on the mat and" with new
label "shat". For full sentences you ask NN multiple times, with
different pieces, you get a sequenced -ish looking output, you might
get "cat sat on the mat and shat". There is no planning, no true
sequencing. One datapoint has no relation to the next. That's what I
meant previously when I said these things are, at their core,
extremely dumb.

Howard: "Something I think pretty much everyone..  including Yann LeCun
agrees on is LLMs aren't going to make it. They're not a path to
ASI. They're getting more and more expensive, they're getting more and
more slow, and the more we use them the more we realize their
limitations...

The thing you can really see missing here is this this planning piece,
so if you try to get an LLM to solve like fairly simple graph coloring
problems, or fairly simple stacking problems, things that require
backtracking and trying things and stuff, they, unless it's seen
something pretty similar in its training, they just fail terribly...

We need to be working on this missing piece, because a
step-by-step solution to a math problem is something that currently is
pretty challenging for an LLM to do well"

---

Jeremy Howard says in terms of goal for AI, we should actually be
talking about ASI (A. Super Intelligence) instead of AGI. He is right,
current crop of tools are pretty general, they shoot the shit on
topics like a random jagoff who can read Wikipedia. But that's not
what we want.. we don't want general intelligence, we want
consistently good intelligence that can perform any task previously
done by a regular human, better, consistently. Give this thing a math
problem, it should be able to solve it, not generate random musings
about it like a halucinating stochastic parrot. It should fly, not
fall with style.

I actively avoid this faux AI shit like the plague myself

CSIS: "Some Israelis and outside analysts had come to believe that
serving as Gaza’s governing body for nearly two decades had moderated
[Hamas'] stance on the conflict and resistance to Israel, with the
group accepting that a massive assault would be counterproductive. On
the surface, at least, Hamas seemed to back up this perceived change
with actions...

Was this strategy just a front while the group planned the October 7
attack? Perhaps. But Israel and the international community did not
make a major shift in their policies in response to Hamas’s
moderation. There were limited economic concessions and statements
acknowledging Hamas’s role in governing Gaza. At the same time, there
was incendiary far-right political rhetoric and rising levels of
violence against Palestinians. Both 2021 and 2022 set records as the
deadliest years for Palestinians, as the Netanyahu government
green-lit the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and settlers
themselves conducted pogroms against Palestinians" via @wilbr@glitch.social

European Court of Justice was one of the things the Brexiters whined
about the most, because remember, they wanted to "take back their
freedom" and not be subject to opressive European laws through ECJ
enforcement.

But I bet their whining wasn't as much about taking back their local
independence but about wanting to keep using this ICSID system where,
I suspect, Anglo companies are favored more. IOW Brexiters wanted to
go back to the shady multinational system they helped found where
their rich feel more "at home", rather than be more equal terms with
their European neighbors.

The Nation: "The 'Hunt for Hamas' Narrative Is Obscuring Israel’s Real
Plans for Gaza.. The US press and politicians are trying to fit the
attacks on Gaza into a Zero Dark Thirty mold, but it’s something much
simpler—and sinister... The government is doing forcible population
transfers, and this means everyone. It’s the simplest way to explain
Israel’s actions, yet American media—tied to 'counterterror'
narratives—can’t, or won’t, get their minds around the obvious fact
that Israel is attempting to depopulate Gaza in stages"

enables a U.N. chief to raise threats he sees to international peace
and security...

The vote in the 15-member council was 13-1, with the United Kingdom
abstaining. The United States’ isolated stand reflected a growing
fracture between Washington and some of its closest allies over
Israel’s monthslong bombardment of Gaza. France and Japan were among
those supporting the call for a cease-fire"
