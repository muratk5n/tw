<p>You can get rid of the Central Bank change the currency of the country
to someone else's, you can do it, and it can help with
inflation. Bulgaria switched to the Euro their inflation fell. But
that's only half the story. Central Banks are there to fund banks, if
something goes wrong with them, with customer deposits and the like,
CB can print / lend to save the banks. Bulgaria is part of the EU, can
rely on ECB for that. Who's gonna save your ass son? Planning on

<p>Slate: "We are now witnessing a five-car pileup of Trump–slash–Jan. 6
cases that will either be heard by the Supreme Court or land on their
white marble steps in the coming weeks. The court has already agreed
to hear the case of Joseph Fischer, the former Pennsylvania cop
accused of taking part in the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol and
assaulting police officers, to determine the scope of prosecutions for
obstructing an official proceeding. The court’s already flirting with
hearing a direct appeal by special counsel Jack Smith to speedily
resolve Trump’s claims to absolute immunity for his actions in
attempting to overturn the 2020 election. And a game-changer of a case
came out of the Colorado Supreme Court on Tuesday that would knock the
former president off of the Republican primary ballot in that state as
a consequence of his involvement in the insurrection attempt on
Jan. 6, which would also critically apply to the general election
ballot next November. That ruling has to be settled by the high
court in order to forestall, or affirm, other states’ efforts to do
the same thing. Potential appeals of gag orders in criminal
suits and doofy immunity claims in the E. Jean Carroll suit are all
also winging their way to Chief Justice John Roberts’ workstation, and
it’s not even 2024 yet"</p>

<p>Woke is a side-effect of <a href="../../2023/06/evil-geniuses.html">the grand bargain</a>.
Cultural left and economic right made a deal to take economic issues
off the table, label government as evil and give each other permission
to exercise their respective "freedoms". One smokes weed, the other
buys guns.. be free, be free.. Being extreme Woke is one of the few
outlets the cultural left has for exercising its political
activism. That's why they double down on it when things go awry,
because they've already taken much off the table. Over time they've
gone blind, they don't even notice the superstructure anymore. 
This is their Matrix.  Anti-government, pro-rich with a few "freedoms"
sprinkled in to divert attention, all egged on by moneyed interests of
course because it benefits them.</p>

<p>No, that's not how humans work, nor how intelligence works. You are
not creating intelligence, you are just throwing a big SSD at the
problem (and a fancy fuzzy compression algorithm). If you need 1000x
more data to come up with output similar to a human, that means your
model is 1000x worse at generalizing and actual intelligence than a
human (and it's worse, because we know LLMs fail catastrophically when
given tests that require actual intelligence, not just appearing
knowledgeable). At that point you are so far off it is silly to assume
that throwing more compute at the problem in the future will bridge
that gap, with the same approach"</p>

<hr />
<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] The American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an
influential Washington think tank and a major lobbying force for the
military - industrial - Likud alliance, can boast of being the
metaphorical alma mater of a number of powerful members of the Bush
administration. For example, Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife
Lynne Cheney, State Department arms control official John Bolton, and
former chair of the Defense Policy Board Richard Perle all have had
long-standing ties with the institute. The institute played a key role
in promoting Ahmed Chalabi’s group of Iraqi exiles, the Iraqi National
Congress (INC), as a major Iraqi opposition force 'that would be
welcomed by the Iraqi people as an alternative to the regime of Saddam
Hussein' once the United States overthrew that regime. From 1998 on,
when there was U.S. government money openly available to support the
Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein due to the AEI-backed Iraqi
Liberation Act, Chalabi’s INC grabbed the bulk of the funding. In
return, the INC, working closely with the AEI, played an important
role in the justification of the invasion of Iraq. It served, for
example, as a major source of (largely fabricated) intelligence for
the civilian militarists of the Pentagon whenever they found the
intelligence gathered by the CIA and the State Department at odds with
their plans of invading Iraq.</p>
<p>Another example of the interlocking network of neoconservative forces
in the Bush administration and the militaristic think tanks that are
dedicated to the advancement of the military - industrial - Likud
agenda is reflected in the affiliation of a number of influential
members of the administration with the Jewish Institute for National
Security Affair (JINSA). JINSA 'is on record in its support of the
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and against the Oslo Accord'... In
its fervent support for the hard-line, pro-settlement,
anti-Palestinian Likud-style policies in Israel, JINSA has essentially
recommended that ‘regime change’ in Iraq should be 'just the beginning
of a cascade of toppling dominoes in the Middle East.'  JINSA has
influential friends either as liaisons with or members of the Bush
administration. For example, Assistant Secretary of Defense Douglas
Feith is a former JINSA advisor. General Jay Garner, the initial head
of the U.S. occupation authority in Iraq, is also a former JINSA
advisory board member. JINSA advisor Michael Ladeen, who also
unofficially advises the Bush administration on Middle Eastern issues,
has occasionally talked about the coming era of 'total war,'
indicating that the Bush administration should expand its policy of
'regime change' in Iraq to other countries in the region such as Iran,
Syria, and Saudi Arabia. In keeping with its role as a cheerleader
for U.S. intervention in the Middle East, JINSA chose to honor Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz... to receive the 2002 edition
of its Henry M. ‘Scoop’ Jackson public service award. The corporate
sponsor of the affair was Northrop Grumman, a company that Wolfowitz
worked for as a paid consultant prior to joining Rumsfeld’s
Pentagon...</p>
<p>A closer look at the professional records of the neoconservative
players in the Bush administration indicates that '32 major
administration appointees... are former executives with, consultants
for, or significant shareholders of top defense contractors.' For
example, James Roche, former Air Force secretary who took over the
Army, is a former president of Northrop Grumman; his assistant
secretary Nelson Gibbs is another Northrop alumnus. An undersecretary
at the Air Force, Peter Teets, was chief operating officer at Lockheed
while Michael Wynne, a Defence Department undersecretary, was a former
senior vice president at General Dynamics. Defence Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld himself is an ex-director of a General Dynamics subsidiary,
and Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defence secretary, acted as a paid
consultant to Northrop Grumman. Today, point out Hartung and
Ciarrocca, the armaments lobby 'is exerting more influence over
policymaking than at any time since President Dwight D. Eisenhower
first warned of the dangers of the military-industrial complex over 40
years ago'"</p>
