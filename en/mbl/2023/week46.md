Andersen: "[Economist] James Tobin... described financial
professionals' suddenly ballooning pay as 'high private rewards
disproportionate to social productivity' ..

It’s ironic that just as we entered an economic era all about
eliminating inessential middlemen and corporate bloat, one bloated
sector filled with inessential middlemen, finance, has flourished as
never before.

It’s ironic that one of the rationales for America’s 1980s makeover
was to revive the heroic American tradition of risk-taking—given that
so much of the story has turned out to be about reckless financiers
insulating themselves from risk by shifting it to customers and,
through the government, to taxpayers.

It’s ironic that finance, a service industry created to help business
and the rest of us, so bubbly and booming on and on these last four
decades, has mainly helped itself. 'There is no clear evidence,' the
chief financial industry regulator of the U.K. and former
vice-chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe concluded in 2010, 'that the
growth in the scale and complexity of the financial system in the rich
developed world over the last 20 to 30 years has driven increased
growth or stability'"

---

Andersen, *Evil Geniuses*: ".. The final piece of financialization
comes from the enormous growth of the so-called institutional
investors, in particular mutual funds. Owning a share of stock isn’t
the same as being a citizen of a corporate domain, but stock ownership
used to be much more directly democratic, and the finance industry
didn’t run the show... By the 2000s, most stock shares were being
bought and sold by professional asset managers. The several biggest
mutual funds are now the majority shareholders of 90 percent of the
four hundred biggest companies, and such institutional investors
control 80 percent of all the stock in all U.S. public companies...  ​
Mutual fund companies are reincarnated equivalents of the excessively
powerful trusts that made us enact antitrust laws in the first
place. Economists and others across the ideological spectrum now worry
about the effects of this new stratum of command and control. Because
mutual funds have controlling interests in the big dominant
competitors in almost every major business—food, drugs, airlines,
telecommunications, banking, seeds, whatever—they aren’t naturally
inclined to make those rival companies compete aggressively against
one another"

Hossein-Zadeh: "It is often forgotten... that for a few years after
the war, [Stalin] assumed an exceedingly moderate posture... His
nation had lost 25 million people in the war, was desperately in need
of aid for rebuilding, and continued for a long time to nurture hopes
of coexistence.. Evidence thus clearly suggests that the U.S. policy
makers built the gigantic military-industrial complex not out of any
genuine fear of Soviet military attack but out of other motives. Top
among those motives, as pointed out earlier, was to establish a
U.S.-led world capitalist order in which unhindered market forces
would flourish, a world no part of which would be excluded from the
free flow of trade and investment"

Oz Labor walked tightrope having to contend with anti-China stance of
the previous administration and its Aukus, but when Kevin Rudd was

The 100th, centennial has come and gone for so-called "Turks". Kemal

Politico: "The [US] administration’s dramatic about face all but
assured that the plan — which funds the government in two tranches
into January and February — would make it into law... That doesn’t
mean there weren’t hard compromises for Biden and allied Democrats to
swallow. The deal again leaves out the White House’s chief legislative
priority: a nearly $106 billion defense supplemental that would fund
aid to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific"

RU FM says Palestinians even wanted to start talks wout preconditions

more money, stop or else, he chickened out.

hydrogen power is shifting into high gear, winning fans in industries
as varied as motorsport, trucking and plant machinery. And it might
even save our beloved combustion engines from extinction [via clean
fuels]"

minimal, tablet only a dumb viewscreen like those dumb terminals of

Graeber, *Debt*: "Almost all the bubbles of the eighteenth century
involved some fantastic scheme to use the proceeds of colonial
ventures to pay for European wars. Paper money was debt money, and
debt money was war money, and this has always remained the case. Those
who financed Europe's endless military conflicts also employed the
government's police and prisons to extract ever-increasing
productivity from the rest of the population" via @categulario@bookwyrm.welhaba.mx

Politico: "State Department staffers offered a blistering critique of
the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in a
dissent memo obtained by POLITICO, arguing that, among other things,
the U.S. should be willing to publicly criticize the Israelis... It
reflects the sentiments of many U.S. diplomats, especially at
mid-level and lower ranks, according to conversations with several
department staffers as well as other reports.. The memo has two key
requests: that the U.S. support a ceasefire, and that it balance its
private and public messaging toward Israel, including airing
criticisms of Israeli military tactics and treatment of Palestinians
that the U.S. generally prefers to keep private"

SF Writer Charlie Stross: "[T]he influence of science fiction on our
environment seems to have been gathering pace throughout my entire
life. The future is a marketing tool... It's becoming increasingly
unusual to read a report of a new technology or scientific discovery
that doesn't breathlessly use the phrase 'it seems like science
fiction'. The news cycle is currently dominated by hype about
artificial intelligence (a gross mis-characterisation of machine
learning algorithms and large language models). A couple of years ago
it was breathless hype about cryptocurrency and blockchain
technologies—which turned out to be a financial services bubble that
drained a lot of small investors' savings accounts into the pockets of
people like convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried"

The Pal prime minister from the PA is talking a bunch on F24. Poor guy
sounds distressed, understandably so. I realized how little we heard
of them in recent years - ISR plan to cut them out of the discourse
clearly worked. It was all about Hamas Hamas Hamas, ISR spox talking
shit about them, that took all oxygen out of the room and now here we
are.

Why does Israel rely so much on bombing? Bombs are a money maker for
the [military-industrial-likud](../../2023/11/political-econ-us-mil.html)
complex. A soldier on foot shooting a rifle is chump change. That
won't move the stock value at all. You need to rely on big ticket
items, like a BOMB. They will move the dial.

There is the occasional support for Israel in the odd developing
country, but that likely has to do with weapon purchases than anything
else. The US laws that prohibits sale of certain weapons to certain
countries can be by-passed by selling those weapons to Israel who
promptly resells them to the prohibited country.

I worked at an customer analytics project, pre-911, our team bought
personal data from Experian. The info was at some incredible
detail. >300 million US/Canada citizens. We received it, and put it on
an external hard drive, it sat there on our desk, getting connected to
occasionally, it is still hilarious to think bunch of programmers at a
private firm took that from another private firm, with no checks or
balances whatsoever. Now such data hoarding is a cottage industry.

"@dangillmor@mastodon.social

Experian is a criminally negligient 'credit bureau' that hoovers up
personal information, sells it, and lets identity thieves easily steal
'your' account. There is absolutely no accountability because Congress
doesn't give a damn -- and Experian blatantly doesn't give a damn"

Hossein-Zadeh: "Frightened by the specter of peace and/or peace
dividends [after the fall of the Berlin Wall], beneficiaries of
military spending frantically sought to invent and substitute 'new
threats' for the 'communist threat' of the Cold War era, thereby
preempting the realization of peace dividends.

In pursuit of this goal, beneficiaries of war and militarism found a
strong, well-established network of politically savvy allies: radical
Zionist proponents of 'greater Israel.' Because the interests of these
two powerful groups converged over fomenting war and political
convulsion in the Middle East, an ominously potent alliance was forged
between them— ominous, because the mighty U.S. war machine was now
supplemented by the almost unrivaled public relations capabilities of
the hard-line pro-Israel lobby in the United States. The alliance is
unofficial and de facto; it is subtly forged through an elaborate
network of powerful militaristic think tanks"
