The problem with the electric grid is that it is inferior technology,
a crude way of carrying energy from point A to point B. Molecules work
better than electrons. We could transmit energy 10 times faster at
eighth the cost using pipelines, if we use clean gas such as H2, the
whole transmission becomes clean, safe from interruption from extreme
weather events like the one mentioned below.

---

These storms only seem to damage power lines. No damage on pipeline
infrastructure? Not even one?

"During [AU Gold Coast storm] there were wind gusts upto 160 km/h,
200k lightning strikes recorded bringing down 500 power lines,
cutting electricity to 125k homes and businesses"

Every time you redesign your app, you vaporize all the experience
built up by everyone who's been using the current version. It better
be fucking worth it"

Boomers sadly raised the Gen Y who ran the risk of being as blind to
the world around them just as the boomers were.

---

It was probably easy selling anti-government sentiment to Americans.
After Watergate, Vietnam, the dozy headed bird brain boomers lost
their minds, pooh-poohed everything related to government and sold
their soul to the corporate world. And when things started to go wrong
later they still look for innuendo, mistakes "deep" within government
rather than the visible organizations that give them the sugar highs
that cloud their brains if not actively killing them with toxic
chemicals. Government can even serve as a potential controlling parental
scare figure taking the other side on the Woke debate, or censorship
debate, and of course any kind of parental presence you need to rebel
against. Avoid government, be afraid of government. Wait for Batman,
he will help you.

Okay so the director of *Die Hard*, *Die Hard 3*, *Predator*, *The
Hunt for Red October*, *The Thomas Crown Affair*, and, uh,
*Rollerball*, apparently has a new movie coming out next year after
directing nothing since 2003, and this is the description"

TASS: "Spain blocks EU participation in [anti Houthi] US operation in
Red Sea"

---

Read: Fuel that help bomb Gazans comes from a Muslim country.

Responsible Statecraft: "Presently, Azerbaijan supplies approximately
40% of Israel's oil demand, a critical lifeline powering cars and
airplanes"

---

It looks like Azeris have become Anglo's bitch, or more accurately of
the military-industrial-Likud complex. Some among them half-mouth some
Israel criticism, but trade continues.

"Israel’s support was instrumental in Azerbaijan’s victory in its
44-day war against Armenia in 2020."

The Guardian: "Bollards and 'superblocks': how Europe’s cities are
turning on the car..  A fightback is now well under way, driven by a
pressing need to cut air pollution and combat the climate crisis, and
a wish to reclaim cities as pleasant places to live. Most major
European cities now have schemes in place to reduce road traffic"

---

The Guardian: "[2009] Drug money saved banks in global crisis [GFC],
claims UN advisor.. Drugs and crime chief says $352bn in criminal
proceeds was effectively laundered by financial institutions.. Antonio
Maria Costa, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, said he has
seen evidence that the proceeds of organised crime were 'the only
liquid investment capital' available to some banks on the brink of
collapse last year. He said that a majority of.. drugs profits was
absorbed into the economic system as a result"

---

"The Hyperloop was always a scam.. A decade on, people often forget
what was really motivating the Hyperloop.. In the early 2010s, there
was a big debate around California’s plan to build a high-speed rail
line from Los Angeles to San Francisco... Naturally, conservative,
automotive, and airline interests were vehemently opposed to a
technology that Japan and Europe had been living with for decades
arriving on American shores because it threatened their commercial
interests"

---

Stiff upper lip rich class wanted to avoid EU "limitations" (such as
the ECJ), immigration was never an issue for them. They needed and
still do need cheap workers to service their needs, fetch them coffee,
work in stores and put a stupid hat on during "Christmas sale". A
cheap servant class was required and they are getting them.

NYT: "'Take Back Control' of U.K. Borders. What Happened? Record
numbers of legal immigrants came to Britain from outside the E.U. in
recent years. Some on the right call that a 'Brexit betrayal'.

Far from closing its borders, Britain has thrown them open since
voting in 2016 to leave the European Union. And as the coronavirus
pandemic has subsided, legal immigration has exploded. Net legal
migration — the number of people who arrived, minus those who left —
reached nearly 750,000 people in 2022"

Humanity cannot conflict resolve, cannot even address genocide
happening under its own nose. Thinking that this species can peek into
the creation of the universe and theorize, reason about things
happening at that instance is ludicrous. Naturally most theories in
this domain are poppycock. The universe expansion is debunked and so
is the Big Bang. 

---

We need better than human performance out of AI, we'll have to rely on
these things for automation, for patient care... A mechanical arm at a
factory is better than a human arm, and it is better, consistently. The
arm never goes "well I dont feel like lifting that mechanical part
today, 20% of the time I just won't do it". 🤨

---

Best human exceeded 89%. This is image recognition, the thing that
brought back NNs from the dead! Still stuck at 82??? 

---

Best neural net ImageNet score is still at around 82%? 

---

Recommending the show *The Night Agent*. Someone said "its campy" I
thought in this day and age that probably means it's good. And it was.

---

*Rebel Moon* sounds like it will suck. Is it beta cuck?

GS is from a working class background, when he realized he was making
money by betting inequality would make things worse I think it got to
him, quit his job, started talking about econ from outside.

---

They can make billions frm that trade alone. If you know rate will be
2% but consensus is 1% trader can trade on that arbitrage, pocket
the difference.

---

Apparently Gary Stevenson was an interest rate trader at Citibank.
Seriously that's what the guy did, his job, was trying to predict
interest rates one year ahead. But think about what that entails;
growth, debt, deficit, basically knowing how the economy is going to
be in one year because all that ties into rates. If econ is good, CB
will raise, if bad, will lower. Not an easy job.

---

"The recent ["AI"] transfer of [the movie] *True Lies* shows that some
people need their deep learning algorithms taken away from them... The
transfer.. has a truly vile quality to it, a feeling like someone
clandestinely dosed you with LSD just a hair below the threshold. At
times it can look passable in motion, but then you notice something
out of the corner of your eye: a thick fold of skin, a framed photo of
a child, folders that are too thick at the margins, cheeks that look
rendered. It’s that familiar dread at the pit of your gut when you
spot AI generated imagery, a combination of edges not looking quite
right and surfaces that are simultaneously too smooth and too sharp. A
crime was committed here, and you can tell"

Richard Murphy: "How did we reach the point where our society has
failed so badly that malnutrition is now a first world
problem?.. industries like big pharma and big sugar-based food
production have been allowed to prosper. Superficially satisfying
short-term sugar spikes have replaced vitamins and essential minerals
in too many affordable diets...

So, how to solve this? The answer is straightforward. The requirement
is regulation to demand better food whilst cutting sugar from
diets. It could be done. But the resulting foods are not addictive,
when sugar is. The result is there is less profit in them, because
nothing is more addictive than hooking people on products destructive
to their wellbeing... [but our] current health secretary is,
staggeringly, married to the Chair of British Sugar"

The Times of Israel: "Malaysia bans Israeli-flagged ships from using
its ports in response to Gaza war"

NYT: "Under Argentina’s New President, Fuel Is Up 60%, and Diaper
Prices Have Doubled"

Annual changes in the housing stock (percentage), on average, looks
higher than population change. There are enough housing units, but top
10% is likely hoarding them, some people cannot find places to
live. We can regulate home ownership - mandate so that noone can own
more than one home, or a patch of land bigger than enough to live on,
for individuals or business alike, including farming. The rest becomes
public property.

```python
df = u.get_fred(1980,["TTLHHM156N","POPTOTUSA647NWDB"])
df.columns = ['housing','population']
df.asfreq(freq='A',method='bfill').pct_change().mean()*100
```

housing       1.142863

The Intercept: "Dozens of prominent investors and business leaders
traveled to Israel this week to show solidarity with Israel.. The trip
included top officials from private equity firms like Bain Capital;
leaders from the tech industry, like a Patreon executive..  'In every
war there are multiple fronts. The attendees of this mission are here
to help counter the war’s economic disruption.'  The documents, which
include an itinerary provide details about the weeklong meeting taking
place in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, called the Israel Tech
Mission. Beginning on Sunday, the meeting includes panels like 'Tech
in the Trenches: Supporting an ecosystem during wartime'"

And dude just got fired, for speaking out

"@paulbiggar@hachyderm.io

I wrote about the genocide in Palestine, and how tech has been silent
and complicit. In it, I call out my investors who are whitewashing the
genocide and promoting Israeli talking points while Israel bombs and
murders innocent civilians"

Al Monitor: "US sees new isolation from Israel support..  Nearly three
years after President Joe Biden took office vowing 'America is back,'
the country's international image is taking a beating as his
administration backs Israel in its war with Hamas"

---

"@JoshuaHolland@mastodon.social

When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Hitler and Mussolini went all-in
backing Franco’s Nationalists but the big democratic powers, England
and France, offered the democratically elected Republicans tepid
support because they were wary of socialists and trade unionists being
part of the coalition. Their half-hearted defense of democracy
emboldened the fascists and contributed to the outbreak of WWII"

"Britain’s Cyprus base has secretly become international military hub
supporting Israel’s bombing of Gaza"

NYT: "Israel-Hamas War: U.N. Security Council Resolution Is Criticized
as Insufficient.. The compromise resolution, negotiated to avoid a
veto from the United States, stopped well short of calling for a
cease-fire. Aid workers say they cannot address the enclave’s deep
needs because of intense Israeli airstrikes and fighting on the
ground"

Politico: "Israel ‘creating massive obstacles’ to Gaza aid, UN chief says"

---

Politico: "While Senate negotiators vow to keep working into January,
the reality is that future aid for Ukraine is more in doubt than ever"
