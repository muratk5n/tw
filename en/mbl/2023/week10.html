<h1>Week 10</h1>
<p>In regular business ppl compete, excesses can be handled at the
courts.. Guy stepping over your IP, sue. But drug cartels are by
definition outside the law; so conflicts are handled by the gun. In
Tijuana they fight over access to trade routes, supply, manpower..
It's business. Regular people are caught in the crossfire.</p>
<hr />
<p>Right across the border from Tijuana is San Diego; US has demand,
money, Mexico has product. Narcotics is an extremely <a href="0119/2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.html#drugs">high-margin</a>
business, product is easy to produce, and not fragile like electronics,
once certain hurdles are overcome, u could even catapult it over the wall
from Tijuana to San Diego. So high demand check, ease of production check,
-physically speaking- easy to transport check.</p>
<p>Then the product is made illegal. How could this backdrop not lead to
rampant violence?</p>
<hr />
<p>Media calls the new police chief in Tijuana "Mexico's Rambo"... They
like these catchy phrases.. But the general environment is not

<p>GPM is a useful measure for long-term investors, Buffett likes it, no?
I can see why, the measure shows the fundamentals, what it takes to
generate revenue. Above certain threshold, a clear up-trend can
indicate a rosy future; the indirect stuff can be dealt with as
needed.</p>
<hr />
<p>The high GPM is typical of a software company with a commanding lead
in the market place as GPM shows direct costs for creating a product.
Software companies don't typically spend too much to produce,
especially once the core product / platform is mature, likely the case
for SF by now. But if there are a lot of extra, indirect spending,
fluff investments it can hurt OPM, PM.</p>
