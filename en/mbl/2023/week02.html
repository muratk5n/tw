<p>A key founder of a TR nationalist party was of Jewish ancestry, born
in Greece, converted to Islam and considered Turk. This is the "Young
Turks" the Western media publicized back then (yes same ppl who were
the perpetrators of much crime later on - 'allegedly').</p>
<p><a href="../../2021/06/eternal-dawn-kemal.html#cavid">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Religion-Nationality is hiding deep categorization errors. Past
milenia saw many peoples around Asia Minor converting to Islam
including original Turks.. But 1920s TR nation recategorized all
Muslims as Turks. So then.. not everyone is a real Turk, is it, as in
from Central Asia riding a donkey arriving to Anatolia "bringing
civilization" there (basically Greek music, Greek food, Mediterrenian
customs, "brought culture" wink wink). 10% of Asiatic genes says it
all - the <em>latest</em> official identity of Asia Minor is patently false.</p>
<hr />
<p>Notice how religion was used as national identity. Not many realize
but the 20s Turkification also took religion as the basis (but then
deemphasized the religion itself, later reemphasized after 80s
-confused yet?-).</p>
<p>"[T]he 1923 Treaty of Lausanne was drawn up in the peace
settlement.. both Greece and Turkey agreed to a mutual exchange of
populations, irrespective of those populations' wishes.  Greece
expelled approximately 600,000... while [TR..]  expelled about 750,000
Anatolian Greeks... (some were allowed to stay in Istanbul).  These
figures differ, depending on the source. In deciding ethnicity, the
criterion used was religion. A Turkish-speaking Orthodox Christian in
Turkey was thus considered Greek, and expelled to Greece, while a
Greek-speaking Muslim who knew no Turkish was considered Turkish and
expelled to Turkey"</p>

🤔 Can reverse engineer it from profit estimation; Profit P, Gross G,

means the $P=0$, marketing half the budget as before, $ 0 = G - (B +
\frac{B}{2} + 0.4 G)$ rearrange $0.4 G = B$, G=1400, then budget could
be ~560 million.</p>
