<p>"It’s curious to some that the bank run somehow started before SVB’s
public announcements on March 9. It’s almost as if a number of very
lucky folk knew a great deal about what was going on before Joe Public
did. And the same depositors who withdrew their funds had contractual
agreements, which required them to keep their deposits at the bank or
face severe penalties. Somehow, these depositors were so desperate to
yank their deposits that they willingly violated those agreements and
sustained the penalties. I am not sure what information these
depositors learned that caused them to act so hastily without regard
to their agreement and breach consequences. Call me cynical but I am
also guessing that a number of those in the know were probably selling
a boatload of SVB stock between February 28 and the evening of March 9."</p>

<p><em>Battlestar Galactica</em> was good scifi - it brought more realism to the
genre. It did away with "beam weapons", the ships were shooting
physical objects at eachother.. Ships were powered by a fuel,
something substantial, not "charged". The fuel, "tylium", had to be
mined (when they ran low attempting to get more was two-ep long
adventure).</p>

can reach speeds of 140 miles per hour. A single tank of hydrogen can
last for more that 600 miles. Germany’s trains are a 'model for the
