<p>The EV Report: "Hyzon Motors Inc., a leader in high-power hydrogen
fuel cell technology, has successfully completed its first commercial
demonstration of a liquid hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (LH2
FCEV)...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The LH2 FCEV trial began in Temple, TX and covered over 540 miles
during a 16-hour continuous run, delivering to eight PFG customers
near Dallas, TX.</p>

<li>
<p>The vehicle operated under strenuous conditions, including

<li>
<p>Liquid hydrogen offers several advantages over its gaseous form,
including higher energy density and no added weight to the vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proprietary 200kW fuel cell system developed by Hyzon Motors is

<p>You fit a formula / model to data, what remains is the residual. As
below, I fit a straight line to data, it looks linear, the fit looks
ok, I look at the residual (diff between formula and data), if it
looks "noisy" that's good, all patterns are explained with the
formula, the rest is noise (which has a precise statistical
definition, anyway).</p>
<p>The Solow method looks at the residue and tries to find leftover
patterns there, proposes once labor, capital are accounted for, what
remains has to be technology.</p>

<p>It happens in engineering all the time; the Euler-Bernoulli beam
formula $E I d^4 y / d X_1^4 = q$ shows how a construction beam
behaves under stress. You can derive this formula from start to
finish, with certain assumptions, one which is uniform width, that is
why the $I$ is constant. But then we want to apply this formula to
complex shapes where $I$ changes.  Here the scientist knows he cannot
use the formula as-is, so says the math. But.. what if he uses the the
formula on a <em>small</em> piece of the object where $I$ can stay reliably
constant so the formula is still relevant and we put all the pieces
together computationally? Voila. This BTW is the famous Finite Element

the hell it does before parroting its shit out, its structure is not
something you can work with, legibly. The best anyone can hope for is
can generating "art" impressing audiences who are not aware of how the

<p>For the <a href="../../2023/05/how-to-science.html">circle area formula</a> we used the
mental gymnastics to reach a final formula, but do not revisit the
derivation once we are done. Could this be similar to a neural net
learning from data, once done, we pay no attention to how you got
there (so ignore the internal junk that is the NN design)? That is not
the same thing at all.. In the first case even if not used, we still
have the math, it makes sense to us, still connected to the problem
domain somehow, can always go back and change some assumptions, for a
different problem, or a new application. With NNs this is not
possible.</p>

<p>Anatolia ("Turkey") is a traditional Paki ally - they were Anglo
poodles together, their militaries were similar (loved coups,
constantly meddled in politics). Is Paki rival India balancing out a
Paki ally with a friendship of that ally's rival?</p>

impacts the neuronal membrane. It has a toxic effect on our brains,

<p>"AI" researchers are divided on whether these f-ing neural nets can
actually think or not... Hinton admitted as much. In comparison does
materials science have divisions? Aeorodynamics? How about the Fluid
Dynamics community? Are they divided? No. They are not divided on core
issues because their branch is scientific - it has solid mathematical
foundations.</p>

<p>China's subsidies are high I bet bcz much industrial production is
outsourced to them (the world's factory). Some of the would-be Western
subsidies would show up on their side of the ledger.</p>
<p>IMF: "Globally, fossil fuel subsidies were $7 trillion in 2022 or 7.1
percent of GDP.. By country.. China contributes by far the most to
total subsidies (2.2 trillion) in 2022, followed by the United States
(760 billion), Russia (420 billion), India (350 billion), and the
European Union (310 billion)"</p>
