America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we

<p>If I had to pick one clean tech product to focus on personally, it
would be an ammonia fuel-cell for home/personal use (low temperature
version). Purchase fuel from existing ammonia infrastructure, then use
it to power home and other applications. Once NH3 itself is clean,
"well-to-wheel" becomes clean. </p>

<p>IMO pastoralists represent a third kind of human organization - other
two are forager, farmer, this is the third way, they did domesticate
animals but do not stay in one place as the static farmer giving them
an advantage. Their main archetype would be the shephard. I see them
closer to foragers than farmers.</p>

<p>Steppe Migration Map - pastoralists came from Yamnaya</p>
<p><img width='340' src='yamnaya.jpg'/> </p>
<hr />
<p>Farmers from A. Minor migrated to Europe, later 4800 BC pastoralist
steppe people migrated there. Farmers got wiped out by plague, they
were kinda unhealthy too much grain (lactose intol, could not handle
milk, cheese). Their death eased steppe migration, pastoralists
attacked them too. In some ways Europeans (esp males) are Russians.</p>
<p>Steppers were pastoralists, had 'free-range' cattle moved a lot, lived
on milk and meat, not grain. Healthier, were physically more fit,
taller on average.</p>

<p>SCW Systems: "[W]e also know water as a gas in the form of steam and
as a solid in the form of ice. But there is also a fourth state of
water: the supercritical state. Under extreme conditions (very high
pressure and temperature) water acquires very special properties. This
is the core of this technology.</p>
<p>If we mix water with organic wastes and bring it into the
supercritical state, something special happens. All organic matter in
the water, both recently formed organic matter and fossil-based,
breaks down into gases we can put to good use: methane and hydrogen"</p>

<p>This might actually be the paper that initiated the word 'stochastic parrot' 
#ChatGPT #DeepShit</p>
<p>"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots.. [One] category of risk
involves bad actors taking advantage of the ability of large
[neural-net based language models -LM-]s to produce large quantities
of seemingly coherent texts on specific topics on demand in cases
where those deploying the LM have no investment in the truth of the
generated text. These include prosaic cases, such as services set up
to ‘automatically’ write term papers or interact on social media..</p>
<p>Yet another risk connected to seeming coherence and fluency involves
machine translation (MT) and the way that increased fluency of MT
output changes the perceived adequacy of that output.  This differs
somewhat from the cases above in that there was an initial human
communicative intent, by the author of the source language
text. However, MT systems can (and frequently do) produce output that
is inaccurate yet both fluent and (again, seemingly) coherent in its
own right to a consumer who either doesn’t see the source text or
cannot understand the source text on their own"</p>

<p>People will still work for extra pay. But in terms of the essentials,
we need to remember currently less than 2% of US labor is sufficient
to produce food - this is the percentage of labor in farming. That
means the labor of 98% is already not necessary for the most essential
item - sustenance.</p>

department is headed by Cerelyn Davis, a Black woman. None of this
helped Nichols, another victim of a modern-day police lynching.  ​</p>
<p>The militarists, corporatists, oligarchs, politicians, academics and
media conglomerates champion identity politics and diversity because
it does nothing to address the systemic injustices or the scourge of
permanent war that plague the U.S. It is an advertising gimmick, a
brand, used to mask mounting social inequality and imperial folly. It
busies liberals and the educated with a boutique activism, which is
not only ineffectual but exacerbates the divide between the privileged
and a working class in deep economic distress. The haves scold the
have-nots for their bad manners, racism, linguistic insensitivity and
garishness, while ignoring the root causes of their economic
distress. The oligarchs could not be happier...</p>
