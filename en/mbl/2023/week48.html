hypermilitarized, destructive foreign policy. They help drive
up Pentagon spending for arms races and endless wars and

<p>Next stop: both-sides-ing reporting of "existential risk". OpenAI is
deep within the TESCERAList cult. It's staffed by people who actually
believe they're creating autonomous thinking machines, that humans
might merge with one day, live as uploaded simulations, etc...</p>
<p>It is an enormous disservice to the public to report on this as if it
were a "debate" rather than a disruption of science by billionaires
throwing money at the hope of bringing about the speculative fiction
stories they grew up reading---and philosophers and others feeling
important by dressing these same silly ideas up in fancy words.. If
you want to be entertained by science fiction, read a good book or
head to the cinema"</p>
<hr />
<p>"@emilymbender@dair-community.social</p>
<p>With the OpenAI clownshow, there's been renewed media attention on the
existential risk / "AI safety" / doomer nonsense. Personally, I've had
a fresh wave of reporters asking me naive questions (as well as some
contacts from old hands who are on top of how to handle ultra-rich
man-children with god complexes)...</p>
<p>As a quick reminder: AI doomerism is also #AIhype. The idea that
synthetic text extruding machines are harbingers of AGI that is on the
verge of combusting into consciousness and then turning on humanity is
unscientific nonsense. At the same time, it serves to suggest that the
software is powerful, even magically so: if the "AI" could take over
the world, it must be something amazing.</p>
<p>Reporters working in this area need to be on their guard and not take
the claims of the AI hype-mongers (doomer OR booster variety) at face
value.. Remember.. [OpenAI] Chief Scientist says that "ChatGPT just
might be conscious (if you squint)" (and gets this remark platformed
by MIT Tech Review, alas)..</p>
<p>"AI" is not "good at writing" ? it's designed to produce plausible
sounding synthetic text. Writing is an activity that people to do as
we work to refine our ideas and share them with others. LLMs don't
have ideas. (And it bears repeating: If their output seems to make
sense, it's because we make sense of it.)</p>
<p>And before anyone asks me to prove that AGI doesn't exist: The burden
of proof lies with those making the extraorindary claims. "Slightly
conscious (if you squint)", "can generalize, learn and comprehend" are
extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence, scrutinized by
peer review"</p>

<p>EFF: "Police, on the hunt for easy solutions to the ebbs and flows of
crime, are quick to reassure residents they have found the
technological silver bullet. But police must also overcome growing
community concerns about surveillance technology, and find ways to
justify license plate readers that result in innocent people being
pulled from their car by gunpoint, face recognition that too often
misidentifies people, and acoustic gunshot detection technology shown
by studies to not work well. To do this, police and companies work
together to justify the often-shocking expenditures for some of this
tech (which these days might be coming from a city’s COVID relief
money)...</p>
<p>One investigation into Amazon’s surveillance doorbell, Ring, found
that Los Angeles Police Department officers were given discount
codes—and the more devices purchased with that code, the more free
devices were given to the officer. In this situation, how would a
person know whether the officer encouraging them to purchase a
security camera is making an independent recommendation, or hoping to
win increased perks from the company?"</p>

<p>There hasn't been much logic behind US foreign policy except kowtowing

"bases", there are 800+ around the world but they aren't exactly
useful in a strategic sense.. They get built, Fluor, the Walsh Group,
Hensel Phelps, or Lendlease get contracted, they make munee. Some
survaillance equipment is placed on them, Lockheed, Raytheon, GM gets
munee. Are the bases useful? Doubtful. When US decided to truly
contain China, it was realized 'oh shit we need substantial presence
in Philippines'. Where was the wizbang strategery before that? What
