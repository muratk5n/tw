H2 Central: "The global market for ammonia is poised to triple in the
coming decades with nearly all of the growth coming from low-carbon
ammonia, a new analysis by S&P Global Commodity Insights
says.. Decarbonization policies, including incentives in the
U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism, are transforming the economic fundamentals of low-carbon
ammonia.

The.. report says that the potential use of low-carbon ammonia as a
marine bunker fuel, industry feedstock and as a carrier for hydrogen
used in power generation represents a profound shift for the
industry—from one geared primarily towards fertilizer production to
one driven by energy markets.

*300 Rise of an Empire* - a perfect psyop if there was one. The Greeks
are fighting for "democracy" and the other side, "the Persians", are
of course for autocracy.  Forget the fact that the Greeks of the era
were not a true democracy -they had widespread slavery- but
whatever. "Persians" were painted as visibly Middle Eastern looking
(wink wink, such people are your target) in the hopes that the lazy
fat fuck on his La-z-boy could directly / subliminally be brainwashed
against them and as a bonus Persia is today's modern Iran. Lena Headey

They are mad their beloved feudal fascist slave empire Rome had

ugh... Ditto for Victorians who had their empire too similar to Rome,
a singular source of order, unlike that "mess" that was the Middle
Ages.

"@natania@mastodon.world

Just your friendly reminder that the Middle Ages were not

1) a sepia toned wasteland of filth

2) completely void of education or reason

3) relegated only to Europeans

4) a guaranteed death sentence by the age of 35

5) a culture solely defined by the Church 

6) full of torture devices..

We have the Victorians to thank for so much of this, and then

Some in the Congress are being a bitch for bidness

NYT: "Blocked Rail Crossings Snarl Towns, but Congress Won't
Act.. Freight trains frequently block roads nationwide, a phenomenon
that local officials say has grown steadily worse in the last decade
as railroads run longer trains and leave them parked on tracks at
crossings. The blockages can turn school drop-offs into
nightmares... The problem has persisted despite numerous federal,
state and local proposals and laws because the freight rail industry
wields enormous political and legal power.. No federal laws or rules
penalize railways for blocking crossings, and congressional proposals
to address the issue have failed to overcome opposition from the rail
industry"

a single person in my field who doesn’t laugh at Nature’s so-called
open-access strategy...

It is basically the Matthew Effect: the rich people in academia become
richer, the already poor become poorer. At the very least, I would say
that it’s much harder to excel in science when you are from an
underprivileged country"

Anil Dash: "There's an extraordinary amount of hype around 'AI' right
now, perhaps even greater than in past cycles, where we've seen an AI
bubble about once per decade. This time, the focus is on generative
systems, particularly LLMs and other tools designed to generate
plausible outputs that either make people feel like the response is
correct, or where the response is sufficient to fill in for domains
where correctness doesn't matter...

Amongst engineers, coders, technical architects, and product
designers, one of the most important traits that a system can have is
that one can reason about that system in a consistent and predictable
way. Even 'garbage in, garbage out' is an articulation of this
principle..

Today's highly-hyped generative AI systems (most famously OpenAI) are
designed to generate bullshit by design. To be clear, bullshit can
sometimes be useful, and even accidentally correct, but that doesn't
keep it from being bullshit. Worse, these systems are not meant to
generate consistent bullshit — you can get different bullshit answers
from the same prompts. You can put garbage in and get... bullshit out,
but the same quality bullshit that you get from non-garbage inputs!
And enthusiasts are current mistaking the fact that the bullshit is
consistently wrapped in the same envelope as meaning that the bullshit
inside is consistent, laundering the unreasonable-ness into appearing
reasonable"

As long as credit is new (printed) money that goes to businesses
directly who are relied upon to hire people so they too can earn money
as salary, the wage/inflation dilemma will never go away. How to raise
rates to kill inflation (by killing growth therefore wages) without
kiling wage growth too much? This is a stupid problem to
have. Businesses should not be at the center of everything. Look at the morons
who run them, why let them have undue influence in your life?

Stoller: "Hollywood vertically integrated, with streamers both making
and distributing their own content. For a time it looks competitive,
because there are multiple streamers, but it’s a group of giants
fighting with each other, instead of a vibrant set of content creators
selling into an open market.. Fast forward a few years later, and now
writers, directors, executives, and shareholders all realize streaming
is an awful business. Netflix and Disney have massively raised prices
on streaming. Meanwhile, the Marvel movies aren't working anymore, but
there is no way to get new creative content into the market. Hollywood
is vertically integrated and there are high barriers to entry to
selling into a streaming service. The industry is in crisis.

What happened in Hollywood is now happening in video gaming. Sony and
Microsoft have both been locking up video game exclusives for some
time"

Pappe: "[An Israeli law] grants automatic citizenship to every Jew in
the world, wherever he or she was born. This law in particular is a
flagrantly undemocratic one, for it was accompanied by a total
rejection of the Palestinian right of return — recognized
internationally by the UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948.
This rejection refuses to allow the Palestinian citizens of
Israel to unite with their immediate families or with those who were
expelled in 1948. Denying people the right of return to their
homeland, and at the same time offering this right to others who have
no connection to the land, is a model of undemocratic practice"

TDB: "One of the greatest Palestinian obstacles to peace is their
claimed 'right of return.' Despite no basis in international law, the
demand remains for the return to Israel of millions of Palestinian
descendants of those who left or were expelled in the 1948
Arab-Israeli war. This is, however, a mere cover for overrunning
Israel’s Jewish population, ergo, no more Israel"

"In the 1950s scientists developed the process for making
high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). They first refined corn into starch,
then converted the starch into glucose, and finally converted the
glucose into fructose by adding enzymes. The resulting sweetener could
be purified to 90 percent fructose, a product that is much sweeter
than glucose or sucrose (common table sugar). Cane sugar was cheap in
the 1950s, and refining HFCS was an expensive process, so the new
sweetener did not get much attention. But in 1973 the Farm Bill
introduced subsidies for growing certain crops—direct payments to
farmers based on target prices set by the government. Under this
system, the government gave farmers “deficiency payments” to ensure
that target prices were met. In the case of corn, farmers could grow
as much as they wanted, sell it at any price, and still make a profit,
thanks to government subsidies. This encouraged a boom in corn
production, lowering its price on the open market, which made HFCS
financially viable"

---

Perlmutter: "Fructose is.. glucose’s evil twin.. Starting around 1970,
manufacturers began adding high-fructose corn syrup to their products,
and in 1984, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi announced that they were
switching from sucrose to HFCS in their soft drinks"

Doctorow: "[T]he 'triangulation' politics beloved of the consultant
class – took over the Democratic Party in the Bill Clinton years.. The
Affordable Care Act was a carefully triangulated compromise, one that
guaranteed a massive flow of public cash to America's wildly
profitable health insurance monopoly and steered clear of any
socialist whiff that Americans would get their care from the
government...  Prior to ACA's passage, 85% of Americans had health
insurance. Today, it's 90%. That's not nothing! 5% of the US is more
than 16m people. But what about the 85% – 282m people – who were
insured before the ACA? Their insurance costs have doubled – from an
average of 15,609 dollars for a family of four in 2009 to 30,260
today"

How did open source help Big Tech? Many examples. The book *In the

centers around 2004 costing billions, but they could still fund
it. Without FOSS that cost would be prohibitive. They were building in
secret bcz they didn't want Microsoft to find out about how big search
was. Without open source they'd have to build slower, am I right
