"While [Venus and Mars] may not seem alike at first blush,
Venus is quite similar to Earth compared to other planets in our solar
system. So much so, the Morning Star is sometimes called Earth’s
'sister planet'. Its gravity is 90% as strong as Earth’s, compared to
Mars’ ~38%, meaning that our muscles won’t atrophy, and our bones
won’t decalcify as they do in low-gravity environments"

hydrogen storage solution, designed to hold 300 to 600 tonnes of
hydrogen at a fraction of the cost of onshore infrastructure.. Dubbed
H2Leo, the solution has already received an Approval in Principle
(AiP) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and is hoped to
provide the global hydrogen industry with an energy efficient and
cost-effective storage solution. Targeted to cost 0.2-0.3m per tonne
of hydrogen (200-300 dollar/kg hydrogen) Provaris says H2Leo will make
the storage system “significantly cheaper than onshore solutions.”

WION: "Why do whales commit suicide? Answer may be sonar.. [H]ow could
the ocean's most accomplished deep-sea diver wind up with nitrogen
bubbles poisoning its veins..  'In the presence of sonar they are
stressed and swim vigorously away from the sound source, changing
their diving pattern.. which makes the animals accumulate nitrogen'
[says expert]..

Starting around 1960, ships began emitting underwater signals in a
range of about 5 kilohertz (kHz). That is when the mass beaching of
beaked whales, especially in the Mediterranean, began... The most
deadly episode, in 2002, saw 14 stranded over a 36-hour period in the
Canary Islands during a NATO naval exercise"

more manufacturers will look at Hydrogen as a source to power
vehicles, so looking at the BMW trial is exciting"

Infighting in Sudan, two militaries are fighting; one is the official,
the other, RSF, is a paramilitary group started in 2000s. Much is said
about the RSF leader Hemeti but I heard one speech, he was saying "I'm
a simple Bedouin man who grew up on the sidelines of Sudan and did not
get anything from my country except violence". Life probably wasn't
too easy for him and his people... Generally though having two armies
neither of which feels too attached to civilian rule is not good. It's
like some next level IR joke..  building on the Paki version,
countries have a militaries, PK military has a country, in Sudan, two
militaries have the same country.

The Iraq Study Group Report

The Doran article details how WH stuck to its Iran policy; and likely
forces both internal and external actively tried to undermine this
thawing of relations, and the conflict in ME became more complicated,
and deadly because of it. Secret intel sharing would complicate things
further and obviously help Assad.

Michael Doran: "When [Obama] arrived in Washington in 2006, he
absorbed a set of ideas that had incubated on Capitol Hill during the
previous three years—ideas that had received widespread attention
thanks to the final report of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan
congressional commission whose co-chairs, former secretary of state
James Baker and former Indiana congressman Lee Hamilton, interpreted
their mission broadly, offering advice on all key aspects of Middle
East policy.. The report, published in December 2006, urged
then-President Bush to take four major steps: withdraw American troops
from Iraq; surge American troops in Afghanistan; reinvigorate the
Arab-Israeli 'peace process'; and, last but far from least, launch a
diplomatic engagement of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its junior
partner, the Assad regime in Syria. Baker and Hamilton believed that
Bush stood in thrall to Israel and was therefore insufficiently alive
to the benefits of cooperating with Iran and Syria. Those two regimes,
supposedly, shared with Washington the twin goals of stabilizing Iraq
and defeating al-Qaeda and other Sunni jihadi groups. In turn, this
shared interest would provide a foundation for building a concert
system of states—a club of stable powers that could work together to
contain the worst pathologies of the Middle East and lead the way to a
sunnier future.

Expressing the ethos of an influential segment of the foreign-policy
elite, the Baker-Hamilton report became the blueprint for the foreign
policy of the Obama administration, and its spirit continues to
pervade Obama’s inner circle. Denis McDonough, now the president’s
chief of staff, once worked as an aide to Lee Hamilton; so did
Benjamin Rhodes, who helped write the Iraq Study Group’s report. Obama
not only adopted the blueprint but took it one step further,
recruiting Vladimir Putin’s Russia as another candidate for membership
in the new club. The administration’s early 'reset' with Russia and
its policy of reaching out to Iran and Syria formed two parts of a
single vision"

The Hydrogen Stream: "Global pipeline projects to surge by 2035, says
Rystad.. Rystad Energy said hydrogen pipeline projects could expand by
as much as 700% over the next 12 years. It said that more than 4,300
km of pipelines already transport hydrogen, with more than 90% of them
in Europe and North America. It estimates that there are about 91
planned pipeline projects throughout the world, with 30,300 kilometers
set to go online by around 2035. 'Spain, France, and Germany are among
the countries committed or considering cross-border pipelines to
facilitate energy flows, while the UK with its extensive gas grid
finds itself in a fantastic position to switch from natural gas to
hydrogen,' it noted"

They went behind Bama's back to give Assad intel on the opposition?
Quite a claim. 

Hersh, *The Killing of Osama bin Laden*: "The administration’s policy
was contradictory. They wanted Assad to go but the opposition was
dominated by extremists. So who was going to replace him?  To say
Assad’s got to go is fine, but if you follow that through—therefore
anyone is better. It’s the ‘anybody else is better’ issue that the JCS
had with Obama’s policy... The Joint Chiefs felt that a direct
challenge to Obama’s policy would have 'had a zero chance of success.'
So in the autumn of 2013 they decided to take steps against the
extremists without going through political channels, by providing US
intelligence to the militaries of other nations, on the understanding
that it would be passed on to the Syrian army and used against the
common enemy, Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State... 'Obama didn’t know,
but Obama doesn’t know what the JCS does in every circumstance, and
that’s true of all presidents' [an official said].
