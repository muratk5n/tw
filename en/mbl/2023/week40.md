Vertical Farm Daily: "Why the growth cycle of rice can be [cut] in
half.. Can rice grow normally in a closed environment without sunlight
and soil? The Institute of Urban Agriculture of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences and a team led by Qian Qian, an academic from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and deputy director of the China
National Rice Research Institute, found the answer.

After planting rice and growing it in a closed environment for 63
days, the rice produced full branches, which is more than half the
time it takes to grow rice in an open-field environment. "This is a
subversive breakthrough in the history of rice cultivation," Qian Qian
said"

Informed Comment: "Israel’s Strategic Weaponization of Water Against
Palestine is a War Crime.. The universal human right to water,
ensuring “sufficient safe, acceptable, physically accessible and
affordable water for personal and domestic uses” is a principle upheld

*The Color of Money* is about hustling, money, so kinda repulsive from
get-go - we'll pass. *Cocktail* shows a Cruise telling off a teacher
in academia that he "hides here 'cause he can't hack it in the real
world", goes on to start his own bidness (do that viewers don't be
little bureucrats), on the way he wonders about drink umbrellas, shoe
laces, little wrappers "someone makes those, rips off 10 billion of
them a year and he is a millionaire". He gets his own bar with twins
on the way and he becomes happy with big H - he flashes the big 80s
Cruise smile, as viewers we feel good too, inspired, we think if we
can grind like that, aim for money, we too can be happy, just like the
guy who does shoe laces, or a character who now owns a bar.

In *Born on the Fourth of July* he is a disabled veteran, this time
directly, physically hurt by government. Government did that to him,
they almost killed him, look at the man.. He cries all the time
through a Cruise eager to show his acting ability, trying to dispel
the notion that he is a dumb jock type who cannot act. Director is of
course Oliver Stone, never one to shy away from spreading
anti-government propaganda who can even "by mistake" manage to make
Wall Street greed look cool. The movie works, critics love it, they
shower it with praise and Academy Awards.

*Mission Impossible* series is mostly about bad bad governments, there
are good parts, some good people in it, but mostly bad. Don't be that,
be Maverick of the spy world. What is the latest one about? There is
apparently an "AI".. ? I'm sure that too is related to a bad
government action somehow. Be afraid of that and do entrepreneurish
things, be an outside disruptor.

---

In *Top Gun* he plays military, institution under government, but
notice the role he plays is *Maverick*, "a rebel", portrayed as an
intrepid disruptor, hey the man is almost like a start-up owner, a
non-government entity inside government! Isn't that great! He has
enterpreneurial spirit, of course always "too constrained by
bureucracy" who never seem to see the true value in him, but he
achives things, he gets their approval sometimes. We should be glad
such entreprenurial spirit exists, should aim to be like him.

---

Tom Cruise - was he involved in anti-goverment propaganda vis-a-vis
corporate Holywood? Some of his movies are somewhat guilty in that
regard.. Ok.. Imma hit TC now.

"[P]latinum’s not the only metal they can use for electrolysis,
so.. [University of Texas] scientists have been looking for a cheaper
alternative, like nickel. For nickel to work, however, it has to be
transformed. That’s a difficult process. And the structure of the
prickly pear cactus helped them figure it out. Whereas previous
designs had used one kind of nickel, this one contains two kinds of
nickel fused together in the shape of the cactus leaf and fruit. The
leaf is made of nickel phosphide, and the fruit is made of nickel
sulfide.

This design allowed for more surface area, which was a boon for the
lab. “We could enhance electron mobility with that prickly pear cactus
structure,” [researcher] explained. And it worked. More electron
mobility meant more electrochemical reactions, which in turn created
more hydrogen"

Microgrid Media: "Hydrogen bicycles are becoming a reality. These
unique bikes feature a distinct “water bottle” on their frames, filled
with liquid hydrogen that can be produced right at home. Several
companies are at the forefront of developing small-scale home systems
for hydrogen production and storage, making it accessible and safe for
personal use. These systems are compact, not much larger than a
standard trolley bag, and promise to revolutionize personal
transportation.

<img width='340' src='https://img1.bike-x.de/ub-linde-wasserstoff-e-bike-2016-2-jpg--169FullWidth-68bf2271-1484900.jpg'/> 

One such innovator is China’s Youon, which offers a portable container
weighing 18 kg, housing a 40-liter tank that uses electrolysis to
produce liquid hydrogen. Powered by solar energy, this system can be
seamlessly integrated with city bikes, making it a valuable addition
to bike-sharing services in Southeast Asian metropolises. In just 10
seconds, the tank can be refilled, allowing the bike to reach speeds
of up to 23 km/h and providing a range of 50-60 km. With competitive
pricing and virtually no charging costs, these bikes are set to
significantly impact the market.

Germany’s Linde, an industrial automation company, has developed a
similar bicycle equipped with an electrolysis system. Instead of
relying on solar power, this system can be found in public roadside
towers and utilizes wind or biogas energy sources. Impressively, just
34 grams of hydrogen can power the bike for up to 100 km, offering a
sustainable and efficient mode of transportation.

In France, Alpha Neo has recently entered production with
its aesthetically pleasing and functional hydrogen-powered
bike... 

Toyota, known for its commitment to hydrogen technology, has partnered
with Woven Planet Holdings to develop a portable hydrogen cartridge
measuring just 40 cm x 18 cm. Weighing a mere 5 kg, this mini-bottle
can be easily transported and used on scooters and other small
electrical devices. It promises to extend hydrogen’s reach to remote
and challenging locations, particularly during emergencies"

Massive bills can be tough to handle for legislators, esp for ones who
are left out of the horse trading. They get served the mega bill, that

"The dissenting 8" has some good ideas on procedural stuff. Can they
be implemented? What will the next SoH do?

---

Reagan used to complain about mega bills, and wanted to have a
line-item veto. That would make Prez more part of the legislation IMO,
with exec taking out parts of bills he doesn't like. Issues come
together in bills as part of the horse trading - "give me this I'll
give you that" which is partly why they get bigger and bigger.

Here’s what a firm does when it collects revenue: it invests that
revenue in capturing more revenue.

Sometimes this might mean 'more production,' by which most people mean
'NEW production,' and that’s what orthodox economics imagines
capitalists do. We have all this stuff today, you see, because people
have endless hedonic wants, so we constantly invest our surplus into
creating the tools to make ever more stuff.

But capitalists only *sometimes* invest in new production — [they usually..]

- buy patents to stop competitors from making and selling things

- lobbying the state for subsidies for themselves and regulatory obstacles for their competitors

- undercutting prices to drive their competitors out of business

- buying their competitors

Etc. Note that none of these expand production or create new
production. All of these are either about *reducing their competitors’
income* and hopefully consolidating control over their capital
instead"

Following a recent share about hydrogen powered buses; this is a
quickie refresher essay on hydrogen gas: The preferable way to produce
\#hydrogen is electrolysis using electricity acquired from Nature's
green infinitely renewable clean resources. Electrolysis does not
destroy water; but separates it into its two elements Hydrogen and
Oxygen which are later recombined into purified water again during
'combustion' or fuel-cell exchange outputting much of the original
electrolysis electricity. The same water is split and recombined
forever. This is the infinite cycle that sets hydrogen up above all
other fuels"

Palestinian leader Abbas' claims were not baseless. Isaac Asimov wrote
in his biography *It's Been a Good Life* he himself might not be

religion "[probably] to keep from falling under the influence of
either the Byzantine Christians or the Arab Moslems, who were busily
engaged in the first part of their centuries-long duel". Theirs was a
tactical conversion, had no relation to the Middle East, therefore
their descendants' Semitic connection would be in question. People who
arrived into modern Israel have grandiose claims that aren't
correct. Their grandfathers [did not](../../2020/06/10-myths-israel.html#samejew)
"leave the ancient lands" so their descendants are not "coming back" to
anything..  They are pretenders, squatters in a land that was never theirs.
