I have found the Fediverse remarkable low stress and peaceful so
far. I feel that I am able to give strangers the benefit of the doubt
and it seems to be working out shockingly well"

It sounds like the invention can help massively increase CSP output;
an interesting combo btw panels and solar concentration.

Science Daily: "A new kind of solar panel, developed at the University
of Michigan.. represents a major leap in the technology, nearly 10
times more efficient than solar water-splitting experiments of its
kind... The outstanding result comes from two advances. The first is
the ability to concentrate the sunlight without destroying the
semiconductor that harnesses the light... the second is using both the
higher energy part of the solar spectrum to split water and the lower
part of the spectrum to provide heat that encourages the reaction. The
magic is enabled by a semiconductor catalyst that improves itself with
use, resisting the degradation that such catalysts usually experience
when they harness sunlight to drive chemical reactions"

Maybe they'll find one that will eat coronaviruses one day

viruses... '[viruses are] made up of really good stuff: nucleic acids,
a lot of nitrogen and phosphorous,' said [researcher]. 'Everything
should want to eat them'. ... And sure enough, one particular microbe
seemed to be snacking on the viruses – a ciliate known as Halteria"

Tryptophan also makes serotonin so it helps making ppl feel good, not
tired. The ep could've used that, maybe in the next one where Opposite
George is all happy because of the turkey.

"Tryptophan in turkey gained some notoriety, thanks to an iconic
Thanksgiving episode of the sitcom 'Seinfeld' as the chemical that
makes people tired after eating. The actual truth is people tend to
get tired after a Thanksgiving meal because they generally eat a lot
of food in one sitting"

The collection of the crime data wasn't easy, had to hit the API for
each PD, one by one. A single API call for a summary could be
better. The calls that return bigger results have bizarre paging
issues. If FBI needs it I could give them a few pointers.

Theater's revenue needs to come out of the gross not be a multiple of
the budget.  *Joker* had a budget of abt 70 mil..?  Did the theaters
say "oh we'll take pity on this tiny little movie, give you a pass,
charge you less"? That's not how it works. The more a movie makes, the
more a theater makes - no matter the budget.

---

I don't think the 'multiply budget with two' trick is a sound
estimation approach for marketing + distribution. 

---

Example *Toy Story 4*, grossed 1.13 bil, cost 200 mil. Using 40% of
the gross, half of budget for (good) marketing,

```python
gross = 1130
budget = 200
marketing = budget/2
print (gross - (marketing + budget + gross*0.40), 'mil')
```

```text
378.0 mil
```

This movie's profit was $368 million. Close.

---

I'd say roughly 40% of the gross is for dist, and half the budget for
marketing

"Opening weekend the theater makes between 10 to 20 percent of ticket
sales. Week 2 15 to 30 percent. And so on till it's a 50 50 split
after about 4 to 5 week"

---

How to calculate the profit of a movie? They are not published
immediately, but with known budget, box office gross we could estimate
a total cost (including marketing, distribution).

---

"[I]t is fundamental research—investigations whose findings don't seem
to be immediately useful—that suffer first when technological
development slows. Today those areas are clearly cosmology and
particle or high-energy physics—where the link between science and
technology, theory and human progress, has been broken as in
postclassical Greece, the stagnation of society has led to the return
of mathematical myths, a retreat from the problems of base matter to
the serene contemplation of numbers."

"Big Bang supposedly occurred only about twenty billion years ago,
nothing in the cosmos can be older than this. Yet in 1986 astronomers
discovered that galaxies compose huge agglomerations a billion
light-years across; such mammoth clusterings of matter must have taken
a hundred billion years to form."

"A fundamental breakthrough in chemistry promises to unlock ammonia as

industry in the process. Rice University researchers have created a

thermal catalysts that need thousand-degree temperatures to operate,
and it's made from cheap, abundant copper and iron"

Maersk is mostly responsible of course.. they needed armed security,
they were likely trying to cut costs.

"Approximately half of the crewmembers..  are claiming that the
shipping company, Maersk Lines Limited, willfully allowed the Maersk
Alabama to sail directly into pirate-infested waters despite receiving
multiple warnings to avoid the area. And the lawsuit further claims
that the Alabama didn’t have adequate anti-pirate security measures. "

This "AI" is truly powerful

"@ct_bergstrom@fediscience.org

I've figured out what pisses me off so much about Facebook's Galactica
demo. It's not because people can use to to write bad essays for their
homework. There are plenty of large language models that can do
that. It's because Facebook is presenting it as something that it most
definitely is not. Facebook is selling it as a knowledge engine, a
'new interface to access and manipulate what we know about the
universe'. Actually it's just a random bullshit generator"

The DU research shows the benefits of betting on efficient, simple,
strong base structure - H2 as medium allows further innovations
easily. 

---

The Deakin University research mentioned [previously](../../2022/02/h2-boron-nitrade.html)
accomplishes two things; one is to seperate crude oil gases, the other
is to capture and store H2 with boron nitrade powder. Prof Ying Chen
says the storage part will work on its own, nanopowder captures H2 and keeps it,
later heating it in vacuum releases the gas. Says they have a patent for
their process and already pursuing industrial applications for it. 👍
Whoever he is talking to (he didn't say) I'd find out and invest. Storage
is cheap, in ambient conditions, release of H2 is straightforward.
