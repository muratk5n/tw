<p>Juan Cole: "This book puts forward a reinterpretation of early Islam
as a movement strongly inflected with values of peacemaking.. Life in
[later] medieval feudal societies did not encourage pacific
theologies, and Muslims in later empires lost touch with the realities
of the early seventh century. What if we read Jesus’s life and thought
only through the lens of Pope Urban II, who launched the sanguinary
Crusades in the Holy Land with the cry, “God wills it!”?</p>
<hr />
<p>Below Juan Cole analyzes Israeli culture as an extension of where its
different immigrants came from, rather than an homogenous culture of
transnational religion which stays the same no matter where it is
at. The larger host culture is key. Heritage means little.</p>

<p>Libertards, goldbugs don't understand economics. Cant construct a
modern economy on top of a limited-supply rare metal. Want to be
thrifty, be thrifty - do not need gold for that.</p>
<hr />
<p>Today's libertarian likes gold, dislikes imperialism, but they do not
realize gold historically is a vessel for imperialism, not an
imaginary era of thrift. Only a king could have precious metals dug up
and turned into money and ask that money to be paid to him in tax so
his army could be fed. That's how gold became money, it was useful for
kings and opressive, plundering empires.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note he associates gold with expansionist, feudal imperialism.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rereading parts of the great Graber interview; DG hit the nail on the
head on many subjects. That point on religion is right on the money -
all religion, at its core, is left-wing (sadly they get co-opted and
are made to serve the state - see Romanized Christianity, or -Third
Rome- Ottoman Islam).</p>
<p>Graeber: "In the Middle Ages it all shifts back again — the great
religions, which really started as anti-war movements, take over, the
armies are disbanded, cash disappears, people go back to virtual money
(both checks and paper money for instance were Medieval inventions.)
Then, after 1492 it swings the other way, again — we’re back to gold
and silver money, vast empires, slavery comes back"</p>

<p>Burying the dead with worldly items is a continuation of &lt;10K yr old
agrarian era of ancestor burials, the buried ancestors were later
worshipped since they now represented a connection to (arable) land
vital for survival. See <a href="../../0119/2017/10/wtwrfn-foragers-farmers.html#ancestors">Morris</a>.</p>
