<p>Politico: "[I]n 1792, Congress passed the Post Office Act. Publishers

subsidy. Rates for regular letters ranged from 6 cents to 25 cents,
depending on the distance. The postmaster in 1794 estimated that
newspapers constituted 70 percent of the mail while kicking in about 4
percent of the revenue. Postage paid by publishers defrayed no more
than 12-14 percent of costs, concluded Richard Kielbowicz in News in
the Mail. Scholar Robert McChesney has estimated that 'if the
U.S. government subsidized journalism today at the same level of GDP
that it did in the 1840s, the government would have to spend in the
neighborhood of $30-35 billion annually.' That’s about the size of
NASA’s budget"</p>

you're destroying it with that pasteurization, so when you put a big

<p>Yeah it's a little bit better than Coca-Cola, but not a whole lot.
Orange juice is about 8% sugar.  Apple juices about 10% sugar. So if

<p>BTW can enough carbon be captured from the air for all efuel needs? If
