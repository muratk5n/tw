H2 Insight: "Hyzon's first liquid hydrogen-fuelled truck travels 870km
without refuelling in 16-hour test run"

Science: "(ARPA-E), the high-risk, high-reward arm of the Department
of Energy (DOE), announced it would fund $20 million in grants to
advance technologies for extracting clean-burning hydrogen from deep
rocks. At the moment, all of the world’s hydrogen is manufactured
industrially. But some researchers have concluded that, contrary to
conventional wisdom, Earth harbors vast deposits of the gas that could
be tapped like oil"

EPI: "Ohio lawmakers have introduced a bill that would make it illegal
for electric and gas utilities in the state to charge their customers
for political influence activities. The bill would also introduce new
transparency measures designed to prevent utilities from secretly
spending huge sums of money on politics, a response to FirstEnergy's
spending of $60 million in dark money at the center of a bribery
investigation that led to the conviction of the state's speaker of the
House earlier this year"

These people arrive BTW because there is demand for them in US, for

"[Pardo] The.. extremists in the government, I think, hope to chase
the Palestinians away to Jordan, creating a large new wave of
refugees. I’m not sure, though, that such a thing is possible now, as
it had been in 1948 and 1967. Jordan’s army would try to stop it. If
such expulsion or 'transfer'  succeeded, it would likely make Jordan
unstable, with highly negative security implications for Israel. And
of course such an expulsion of the Palestinians would be a major war
crime that might well lead to sanctions on Israel" via IC

drawn up at the Pentagon and approved by the White House.. Kyiv needs
to collect all its reserves and concentrate them on the direction of
Tokmak in order to take it before November. The establishment of
control over this city will mean the fulfillment of the tasks set by
Washington with the continuation of military assistance.. In the event
that the Armed Forces of Ukraine fail to break through the defenses of
the Russian army and take Tokmok, Zelensky’s office will have to raise
the topic of peace negotiations in November"

was always more radical in reputation than in fact. But it is now a

Auto Blog: "[Toyota] has dabbled in hydrogen technology for over a
decade, notably through a partnership with BMW, and it has built an
experimental hydrogen-powered Hilux truck fitted with Mirai-sourced
technology.

Partially funded by the British government, and built in the United
Kingdom, the Hilux-based prototype is powered by a fuel cell, meaning
the drivetrain uses hydrogen..

The truck is expected to deliver over 365 miles of driving range,
which Toyota notes is "significantly further than might be achieved
using a battery-electric system." [another product] Ford's F-150
Lightning delivers up to 320 miles of range"

The EU makes it rain

F24: "EU hits Apple, Meta and other tech ‘gatekeepers’ with new
regulations.. There will be fines of up to 10 percent of a firm's
global revenues for breaking some of the most serious competition
rules, and even up to 20 percent for repeat offenders...

One of the DMA's main aims is to stop larger players crushing the
progression of smaller companies that threaten to become rivals by
gobbling them up through takeovers.

The EU believes past examples of this are Facebook's buyouts
of Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Google's purchase of YouTube and
Waze. One major change under the DMA is the rule that forces
interoperability between messaging apps, making it easier for users to
share links and images.

Big Data was a revolution - neural net based artificial parrot
algorithms, so-called "AI", still isn't. 

---

Math changes with incremental processing; eg averaging bunch of
numbers, one could bring da whooole thing to memory sum up the whooole
thing then divide that number by a count. Incremental averaging is
different.. You are keeping a running average constantly which is
updated, one line at a time, so you always know the average up to that
point. There are incremental versions for almost every computing task,
clustering, linear algebra, u name it.

---

Some infra even split big files in multiple machines so processing
could be sent to indiv commodity machines close to data which could
then incremental process their pieces. That was Hadoop.

---

The data analysis revolution of 2010s actually was built on this
simple advancement, processing huge files one line at a time. We
changed a lot of our computational science approaches to fit this
mold, because along with it came much increased capability.

It's okay stores being closed in the middle of the day for lack of

Add up changes of a function starting from $a$ on $f(a)$, you will reach
the value of function at $f(b)$. This is obvious. Sounds less scary
than "the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus".  $\int _{a}^{b} f'(x) dx =
f(b) - f(a)$. But of course one needs such rigour too bcz it helps
down the line with other formulations.

Hydrogen produced by renewable energy driven electrolysis can be used
to store excess renewable energy for longer periods, considering that
hydrogen energy provides high energy density, low capital cost, and
easy integration with the existing energy network. Interestingly,
hydrogen can also be used to fuel cars, buses, trucks, and even

Andersen, *Evil Geniuses*: The spectacular rightward swerve of legal
thought starting in the 1980s had two freshly cast ideological
pillars, one focusing narrowly on the Constitution, the other on more
general criteria for determining proper legal outcomes... The one
concerning the Constitution became known in the 1980s as
*originalism*... Originalism’s most important hidden agenda was to
keep courts and judges completely out of the business of business, as
if what worked for the U.S. economy for its first century, before
modern corporations existed, was how things should work today...

As movements, originalism in the law and libertarianism in economics
were fraternal twins. Both were born of extreme nostalgia, fetishizing
and distorting bygone America, so both more easily achieved mass
appeal in the everything-old-is-new-again 1970s and ’80s. Both
purported to be based on objective principles that transcended mere
politics or special interests, even while both were vehicles for big
business and the right to recover, fortify, and expand their economic
and political power"
