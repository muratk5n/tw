Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) solution to enable the long-distance

<hr />
<p>Culture does not care about how it is labeled.. it will be transmited
via osmosis, people-to-people, one-on-one through the land and its
people no matter what. Cannot change your culture by labeling it
differently, or by wearing funky hats, telling stories or following
rituals. The duty of an intelligentia is to pinpoint this fact, argue
around the true source of culture, lest be responsible for generating
neurotic behavior in their students.</p>
<hr />
<p>Herodotus was eating yoghurt in 800 BC; he didn't need some punk from
Asia riding in on a donkey to teach him about it (who hadn't even
arrived by then, that would be a thousand years later). </p>
<hr />
<p>Turks arriving into Anatolia were assimilated, they melted away
culturally and genetically. 1920s TR nationalization, "Turkification"
merely performed a labeling trick. The founders wanted to create
historical amnesia so they picked an exotic, irrelevant ethnicity
(somewhat innocuous meaning simply Muslim as most founders were from
the Balkans), and everyone in Anatolia were rebranded. Muslims were
transitioned, history was rewritten so that all culture before "the
arrival" was made to look like was brought by that irrelevant group,
not pre-existing before their arrival. This is how Byzantian music
became 'Turkish art music", Greek/Balkan/Arab food became "Turkish
food", and Yemenese coffee became "Turkish coffee".</p>
<hr />
<p>Therein lies the fallacy of the "we need more younger workers to
support older population" argument.. Would more "young people" going
into soft drink industry generate value, real benefits, in the long
run? The problem is money creation is too tied to businesses (as
credit), it needs to be tied in large part to salaries (which can
later become credit).</p>
<hr />
<p>Money, credit generated for this business segment is for useless
production. Zero benefit for the humankind.</p>

<p>Crowd Wisdom works only for subjects the crowd has an expertise in eg
gauging the general acceptability of politician as leader, or guessing

<p>Chomsky: "[NYT Opinion] The False Promise of ChatGPT.. OpenAI’s
ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Sydney..  have been hailed as
the first glimmers on the horizon of artificial general intelligence —
that long-prophesied moment when mechanical minds surpass human
brains.. That day may come, but its dawn is not yet breaking.. [as
long as] machine learning programs like ChatGPT continue to dominate
the field of A.I...</p>
<p>The human mind is not, like ChatGPT and its ilk, a lumbering
statistical engine for pattern matching, gorging on hundreds of
terabytes of data and extrapolating the most likely conversational
response or most probable answer to a scientific question. On the
contrary, the human mind is a surprisingly efficient and even elegant
system that operates with small amounts of information; it seeks not
to infer brute correlations among data points but to create
explanations..</p>
<p>It summarizes the standard arguments in the literature by a kind of
super-autocomplete.. In short, ChatGPT and its brethren are
constitutionally unable to balance creativity with constraint. They
either overgenerate (producing both truths and falsehoods, endorsing
ethical and unethical decisions alike) or undergenerate (exhibiting
noncommitment to any decisions and indifference to
consequences). Given the amorality, faux science and linguistic
incompetence of these systems, we can only laugh or cry at their
popularity"</p>

<p>Bakhmut became strategically key, both due to its location (at a
gateway to the rest of Donbas), also bcz Ukraine decided to take a
stand there and <em>make</em> it important. Looking at its topo I can see why -

ranging along its West. Surely UA exploited that structure to set up
staggered defense lines, and delayed RU for as long as they could. But

AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
