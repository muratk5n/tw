The EV Report: "Hyzon Motors Inc., a leader in high-power hydrogen
fuel cell technology, has successfully completed its first commercial
demonstration of a liquid hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (LH2
FCEV)...

- The LH2 FCEV trial began in Temple, TX and covered over 540 miles
during a 16-hour continuous run, delivering to eight PFG customers
near Dallas, TX.

- The vehicle operated under strenuous conditions, including
temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit, proving the feasibility
of liquid hydrogen in real-world applications.

- Liquid hydrogen offers several advantages over its gaseous form,
including higher energy density and no added weight to the vehicle.

- The proprietary 200kW fuel cell system developed by Hyzon Motors is
expected to provide a driving range between 650 and 800 miles,
comparable to many diesel trucks.

- Chart Industries designed a specialized tank system to store liquid
hydrogen at extreme cold temperatures, as low as negative 400 degrees
Fahrenheit, while maintaining necessary pressure levels"

Changes in fundamental tech is different than productivity achieved
through that tech. For most of us twofold tech increase since 50s
sounds odd - it feels like it should've been more. When you talk to
older boomers, you can see they are actually shocked with the types of
tech that became available during their lifetime. A notebook, a
smartphone, for people who grew up seeing these things in their
clumsiest forms the new products have features that approach magic.

But productive application of a that tech is different. You could
manufacture scratch resistant, cyrstal clear smartphone screen, there
is surely productivity associated with its production, but if most
consumers will use this device for silly pastime applications, that is
not productive.

charge controller about 10 years, I have to replace the lead battery
on average every three to five years. Over a 30-year lifespan, the
costs then amount to €120 for the solar panels, €150 for the charge
controllers and – in the best case scenario – €1,020 for the
batteries. The batteries (and associated charge controllers) therefore
account for about 90% of the total lifetime costs"

BloombergNEF: "Hydrogen Subsidies Skyrocket to $280 Billion With US in the Lead"

---

It's good to strive to bring clean energy costs down, eg solar energy,
of clean fuel production.. but we need to remember beyond a certain
number price doesn't really matter - what matters is that the storage
medium has certain optimal characteristics in terms of engineering
properties. Crude oil, natgas had that, and so does hydrogen
(batteries do not). IMF report showed the world spent over a trillion
on fossil fuel subsidies - wout the subsidies, without national navies
protecting sea transport routes, how much would the true cost of oil,
natgas be?  Let's bring the price down for renewables, but we also
need to see subsidies give life to the alternative. The market is
irrelevant.

You fit a formula / model to data, what remains is the residual. As
below, I fit a straight line to data, it looks linear, the fit looks
ok, I look at the residual (diff between formula and data), if it
looks "noisy" that's good, all patterns are explained with the
formula, the rest is noise (which has a precise statistical
definition, anyway).

The Solow method looks at the residue and tries to find leftover
patterns there, proposes once labor, capital are accounted for, what
remains has to be technology.

[[-]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333469185/figure/fig3/AS:764122706743298@1559192458294/Comparisons-of-linear-regression-models-and-residual-plots-obtained-from-the-two-other.png)

---

Maybe that's why Solow also said "you can see the computer age
everywhere but in the productivity statistics". Tech is not being
applied properly, or the system was hindering their application.

Since the 50s TFP nearly doubled. Certain amount of tech progress

Using residuals from capital + labor regression.. that makes sense...
Whatever growth labor and capital cannot explain has to be technology.

"How to Measure Technological Progress.. The Solow Residual method
works under the assumption that all changes in output that can’t be
explained by changes in the capital stock or changes in the number of
workers must be due to technological progress. The method uses a
simple linear regression to estimate growth. Regress output on capital
and labor using simple linear regression.  The regression residuals

It happens in engineering all the time; the Euler-Bernoulli beam
formula $E I d^4 y / d X_1^4 = q$ shows how a construction beam
behaves under stress. You can derive this formula from start to
finish, with certain assumptions, one which is uniform width, that is
why the $I$ is constant. But then we want to apply this formula to
complex shapes where $I$ changes.  Here the scientist knows he cannot
use the formula as-is, so says the math. But.. what if he uses the the
formula on a *small* piece of the object where $I$ can stay reliably
constant so the formula is still relevant and we put all the pieces
together computationally? Voila. This BTW is the famous Finite Element
approach, entire buildings, complex structures are now designed this
way.

With a neural net the data effects neuron \#11121 or neuron \#889444,
which one we have no idea, it's a jungle in there, it does whatever
the hell it does before parroting its shit out, its structure is not
something you can work with, legibly. The best anyone can hope for is
can generating "art" impressing audiences who are not aware of how the
sausage is made.

---

For the [circle area formula](../../2023/05/how-to-science.html) we used the
mental gymnastics to reach a final formula, but do not revisit the
derivation once we are done. Could this be similar to a neural net
learning from data, once done, we pay no attention to how you got
there (so ignore the internal junk that is the NN design)? That is not
the same thing at all.. In the first case even if not used, we still
have the math, it makes sense to us, still connected to the problem
domain somehow, can always go back and change some assumptions, for a
different problem, or a new application. With NNs this is not
possible.
