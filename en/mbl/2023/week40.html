half.. Can rice grow normally in a closed environment without sunlight

<p><em>The Color of Money</em> is about hustling, money, so kinda repulsive from
get-go - we'll pass. <em>Cocktail</em> shows a Cruise telling off a teacher
in academia that he "hides here 'cause he can't hack it in the real
world", goes on to start his own bidness (do that viewers don't be
little bureucrats), on the way he wonders about drink umbrellas, shoe
laces, little wrappers "someone makes those, rips off 10 billion of
them a year and he is a millionaire". He gets his own bar with twins
on the way and he becomes happy with big H - he flashes the big 80s
Cruise smile, as viewers we feel good too, inspired, we think if we
can grind like that, aim for money, we too can be happy, just like the
guy who does shoe laces, or a character who now owns a bar.</p>
<p>In <em>Born on the Fourth of July</em> he is a disabled veteran, this time
directly, physically hurt by government. Government did that to him,
they almost killed him, look at the man.. He cries all the time
through a Cruise eager to show his acting ability, trying to dispel
the notion that he is a dumb jock type who cannot act. Director is of
course Oliver Stone, never one to shy away from spreading
anti-government propaganda who can even "by mistake" manage to make
Wall Street greed look cool. The movie works, critics love it, they
shower it with praise and Academy Awards.</p>
<p><em>Mission Impossible</em> series is mostly about bad bad governments, there
are good parts, some good people in it, but mostly bad. Don't be that,
be Maverick of the spy world. What is the latest one about? There is
apparently an "AI".. ? I'm sure that too is related to a bad
government action somehow. Be afraid of that and do entrepreneurish
things, be an outside disruptor.</p>
<hr />
<p>In <em>Top Gun</em> he plays military, institution under government, but
notice the role he plays is <em>Maverick</em>, "a rebel", portrayed as an
intrepid disruptor, hey the man is almost like a start-up owner, a
non-government entity inside government! Isn't that great! He has
enterpreneurial spirit, of course always "too constrained by
bureucracy" who never seem to see the true value in him, but he
achives things, he gets their approval sometimes. We should be glad
such entreprenurial spirit exists, should aim to be like him.</p>

<p>"[P]latinum’s not the only metal they can use for electrolysis,
so.. [University of Texas] scientists have been looking for a cheaper
alternative, like nickel. For nickel to work, however, it has to be
transformed. That’s a difficult process. And the structure of the
prickly pear cactus helped them figure it out. Whereas previous
designs had used one kind of nickel, this one contains two kinds of
nickel fused together in the shape of the cactus leaf and fruit. The
leaf is made of nickel phosphide, and the fruit is made of nickel
sulfide.</p>
<p>This design allowed for more surface area, which was a boon for the
lab. “We could enhance electron mobility with that prickly pear cactus
structure,” [researcher] explained. And it worked. More electron
mobility meant more electrochemical reactions, which in turn created
more hydrogen"</p>

<p>Microgrid Media: "Hydrogen bicycles are becoming a reality. These
unique bikes feature a distinct “water bottle” on their frames, filled
with liquid hydrogen that can be produced right at home. Several
companies are at the forefront of developing small-scale home systems
for hydrogen production and storage, making it accessible and safe for
personal use. These systems are compact, not much larger than a
standard trolley bag, and promise to revolutionize personal
transportation.</p>
<p><img width='340' src='https://img1.bike-x.de/ub-linde-wasserstoff-e-bike-2016-2-jpg--169FullWidth-68bf2271-1484900.jpg'/> </p>
<p>One such innovator is China’s Youon, which offers a portable container
weighing 18 kg, housing a 40-liter tank that uses electrolysis to
produce liquid hydrogen. Powered by solar energy, this system can be
seamlessly integrated with city bikes, making it a valuable addition
to bike-sharing services in Southeast Asian metropolises. In just 10
seconds, the tank can be refilled, allowing the bike to reach speeds
of up to 23 km/h and providing a range of 50-60 km. With competitive
pricing and virtually no charging costs, these bikes are set to
significantly impact the market.</p>
<p>Germany’s Linde, an industrial automation company, has developed a
similar bicycle equipped with an electrolysis system. Instead of
relying on solar power, this system can be found in public roadside
towers and utilizes wind or biogas energy sources. Impressively, just
34 grams of hydrogen can power the bike for up to 100 km, offering a
sustainable and efficient mode of transportation.</p>
<p>In France, Alpha Neo has recently entered production with
its aesthetically pleasing and functional hydrogen-powered
bike... </p>
<p>Toyota, known for its commitment to hydrogen technology, has partnered
with Woven Planet Holdings to develop a portable hydrogen cartridge
measuring just 40 cm x 18 cm. Weighing a mere 5 kg, this mini-bottle
can be easily transported and used on scooters and other small
electrical devices. It promises to extend hydrogen’s reach to remote

<p>Following a recent share about hydrogen powered buses; this is a
quickie refresher essay on hydrogen gas: The preferable way to produce
#hydrogen is electrolysis using electricity acquired from Nature's
green infinitely renewable clean resources. Electrolysis does not
destroy water; but separates it into its two elements Hydrogen and
Oxygen which are later recombined into purified water again during
'combustion' or fuel-cell exchange outputting much of the original
electrolysis electricity. The same water is split and recombined
forever. This is the infinite cycle that sets hydrogen up above all
other fuels"</p>

<p>McCarthy can go either way on Ukraine.. so people who were adamantly
against on this issue were right not to trust him. What did Tucker say
once "he puts on a Ukrainian lapel pin and goes to lunch with [some
neocon]"? But from SoH perspective the majority of Senate Reps are pro
UA, needs to deal with that, maybe with some House Dems added on top
can get something all cons want.</p>

<p>In the lands they migrated to later, such as the US, they were
assimilated just like Irish, Polish, Africans had been and became
natives after one generation. It is all about the mainstream culture -
heritage means nothing.</p>

<p>Palestinian leader Abbas' claims were not baseless. Isaac Asimov wrote
in his biography <em>It's Been a Good Life</em> he himself might not be
connected to ancient Israel at all. East European Jews are mostly from
today's southern Russia, and they took up Judaism as the state
religion "[probably] to keep from falling under the influence of
either the Byzantine Christians or the Arab Moslems, who were busily
engaged in the first part of their centuries-long duel". Theirs was a
tactical conversion, had no relation to the Middle East, therefore
their descendants' Semitic connection would be in question. People who
arrived into modern Israel have grandiose claims that aren't
correct. Their grandfathers <a href="../../2020/06/10-myths-israel.html#samejew">did not</a>
"leave the ancient lands" so their descendants are not "coming back" to
anything..  They are pretenders, squatters in a land that was never theirs.</p>

<p>Do you prefer your shelves empty, or under lock and key (the latter
obviously being sign of inequality). Could there be a system where
shelves are somewhat full, and people are not looting?</p>

<p>There were claims back in 2022 MM was mad at the admin on the Ukraine policy and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-diplomacy.html">leaked</a>
to NYT about his own position.. That could be true - but the admin
itself could have told Milley to leak so that outside observers would
know gov is hearing all viewpoints, in a way to quell fears they
weren't completely gung-ho. </p>

<p>You see who calls the shots in US, business wants cheap workers they
get cheap workers. They turned politicians into their bitch. And as

<p>Shared a 7m sea level rise simulation before, that NY area under water
now in Brooklyn is <a href="searise2.jpg">in red</a>. If a place can get
flooded by extreme water events today, after sea rises it will remain
flooded for good. Flooding today is a sign of permanent burial
tomorrow.  Heed the warning and bolt.</p>
