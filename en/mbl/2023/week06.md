Electrification mantra was foolish an idea marketed as a new solution
simply bcz it sounded contrarian. Fuels were always the optimal
solution, we merely needed a clean one \#H2 \#NH3

Still the total projected cost of F-35 project is at $1.7 trillion.
That's a lot of money... I suspect price-performance ratio of this
project is pretty high.

There've been some pushback against this view recently coupled with
better numbers at dogfighting, but, interesting ..  Smoke coming out
of a fire, or just smoke.. as in somebody's blowing it

TDB: "[2015] Air Force Admits: Our New Stealth Fighter Can’t
Fight.. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is supposed to replace almost 90
percent of America’s tactical aviation fleet. Too bad it ‘wasn’t
optimized for dogfighting,’ according to the Air Force"

180,000 users have paid for blue checks in the past two months which
will generate under $25M/year for Twitter. This is a drop in the
bucket for their revenue goals and less than 0.5% of pre-acquisition
revenue.

Also revenue is down -40% since acquisition"

Right now there is a running server at `router.project-osrm.org` with
all of OSM's data. After the apocalypse you'll be running that
locally. It's easy.

Driving from Boston to Wyoming..? For f sake

```python
import requests, json, polyline, folium

lat1,lon1 = (42.36880059119,-71.141522762)
lat2,lon2 = (41.125673090,-104.835825219)
url = f'http://router.project-osrm.org/route/v1/driving/' + \
      f'{lon1},{lat1};{lon2},{lat2}?alternatives=false&steps=false'
response = requests.get(url, verify=False)
resp = json.loads(response.text)
decoded = polyline.decode(resp["routes"][0]['geometry'])
map = folium.Map(location=(lat1,lon1),zoom_start=5,control_scale=True)
folium.PolyLine(locations=decoded, color="blue").add_to(map)

OSM data is produced by volunteer contributors. Freely available,
anyone can contribute.

Getting stuck with paper maps after the Zombie Apocalypse? C'mon. To
get ready for that aftermath, need a recent copy of all the files
[here](http://download.geofabrik.de/). There is open source software
that can read those files, it can extract the road network, compute
driving directions, report on POIs from it.. The files aren't too
sizeable, compared to the value they can provide.

Left Voice: "Everything You Need to Know About Sahra Wagenknecht’s
'Left Conservatism'.. Die Linke has a program calling for 'open
borders.'  Wagenknecht became convinced that this — and this alone —
was why her party was losing support in the East, where it was once a
Volkspartei, a mass party.. [Her book] is a 345-page diatribe against
what she calls 'identity politics' [that] 'amounts to focusing on ever
smaller and ever more bizarre minorities, each of which finds an
identity in some quirk which distinguishes it from the majority of
society, and from which it derives the claim to victimhood'"

---

"Die Linke politician [Wagenknecht].. is rumoured to be planning a
breakaway party.. In her bestselling book [.. she] accused Die Linke
of having neglected 'ordinary people' in favour of what she refers to
as a city-dwelling 'academic clientele'. She says its preoccupation
with issues such as 'gender-conscious language and pricey organic
products' rather than bread-and-butter issues such as 'fighting low
pay' has made it a stranger to its grassroots working-class support
base... Polls show her chances of succeeding as head of a new party to
be good... Among [right-wing] AfD voters the interest was a staggering
68%"

WaPo: "The Big Tech companies that won dominance of the internet
brought in billions of dollars a year, spending it on eye-popping
salaries, gleaming offices and constant acquisition of smaller
companies.

But the past year of rising interest rates and falling stock prices
has shaken the industry, along with the San Francisco Bay region it
dominates. Now, tens of thousands of layoffs from Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, Facebook and dozens of other companies have made it clear: The
golden age is over. Speeches about austerity have replaced the
free-flowing stock grants and free sushi lunches"

"[A]s of 2023, open source really has won. There are more Unix-like
OSes than ever, and some very un-Unix-like OSes which are highly
compatible with it, but the official line [about Unix's death] is, to
all intents and purposes, dead and gone. All the proprietary,
commercial Unixes are now on life support: they will get essential bug
fixes and security updates, but we won't be seeing any major new
releases.

Insider: "Mercedes-Benz 'Drive Pilot' surpasses Tesla's autonomous driving system"

---

Mercedes-Benz: "At the time of this publishing, Drive Pilot's ODD
[Operational Design Domain] is limited to fully access-controlled
highways (commonly called 'freeways') up to a specific maximum
speed. (A fully access-controlled highway is defined as a divided
highway with at least two lanes of traffic in each direction that has
no intersections – only on-ramps and off-ramps.).. ODD is further
restricted according to the presence or absence of certain road
features and/or conditions, such as:

• Machine-detectable lane markings

• The absence of tunnels, toll booths and traffic control devices
(stop signs, traffic lights, etc.)

• Applicable legal requirements

The resulting ODD boundaries (including available routes) are defined
within a precise, high-definition map.  These boundaries comprise the
“geo-fence” for the area of operation of Drive Pilot; it will not
allow the driver to engage the feature, nor will the feature operate
the vehicle, outside of these boundaries"
