<p>Anil Dash: "There's an extraordinary amount of hype around 'AI' right
now, perhaps even greater than in past cycles, where we've seen an AI
bubble about once per decade. This time, the focus is on generative
systems, particularly LLMs and other tools designed to generate
plausible outputs that either make people feel like the response is
correct, or where the response is sufficient to fill in for domains
where correctness doesn't matter...</p>
<p>Amongst engineers, coders, technical architects, and product
designers, one of the most important traits that a system can have is
that one can reason about that system in a consistent and predictable
way. Even 'garbage in, garbage out' is an articulation of this
principle..</p>
<p>Today's highly-hyped generative AI systems (most famously OpenAI) are
designed to generate bullshit by design. To be clear, bullshit can
sometimes be useful, and even accidentally correct, but that doesn't
keep it from being bullshit. Worse, these systems are not meant to
generate consistent bullshit — you can get different bullshit answers
from the same prompts. You can put garbage in and get... bullshit out,
but the same quality bullshit that you get from non-garbage inputs!
And enthusiasts are current mistaking the fact that the bullshit is
consistently wrapped in the same envelope as meaning that the bullshit
inside is consistent, laundering the unreasonable-ness into appearing
reasonable"</p>

kiling wage growth too much? This is a stupid problem to

<p>Stoller: "Hollywood vertically integrated, with streamers both making

because there are multiple streamers, but it’s a group of giants
fighting with each other, instead of a vibrant set of content creators

writers, directors, executives, and shareholders all realize streaming
is an awful business. Netflix and Disney have massively raised prices
on streaming. Meanwhile, the Marvel movies aren't working anymore, but
there is no way to get new creative content into the market. Hollywood
is vertically integrated and there are high barriers to entry to
selling into a streaming service. The industry is in crisis.</p>

internationally by the UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948.
This rejection refuses to allow the Palestinian citizens of
Israel to unite with their immediate families or with those who were
expelled in 1948. Denying people the right of return to their
homeland, and at the same time offering this right to others who have
no connection to the land, is a model of undemocratic practice"</p>

<p>"In the 1950s scientists developed the process for making
high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). They first refined corn into starch,
then converted the starch into glucose, and finally converted the
glucose into fructose by adding enzymes. The resulting sweetener could
be purified to 90 percent fructose, a product that is much sweeter
than glucose or sucrose (common table sugar). Cane sugar was cheap in
the 1950s, and refining HFCS was an expensive process, so the new
sweetener did not get much attention. But in 1973 the Farm Bill
introduced subsidies for growing certain crops—direct payments to
farmers based on target prices set by the government. Under this
system, the government gave farmers “deficiency payments” to ensure
that target prices were met. In the case of corn, farmers could grow
as much as they wanted, sell it at any price, and still make a profit,
thanks to government subsidies. This encouraged a boom in corn
production, lowering its price on the open market, which made HFCS
financially viable"</p>
<hr />
<p>Perlmutter: "Fructose is.. glucose’s evil twin.. Starting around 1970,
manufacturers began adding high-fructose corn syrup to their products,

profitable health insurance monopoly and steered clear of any
socialist whiff that Americans would get their care from the
government...  Prior to ACA's passage, 85% of Americans had health
insurance. Today, it's 90%. That's not nothing! 5% of the US is more
than 16m people. But what about the 85% – 282m people – who were
insured before the ACA? Their insurance costs have doubled – from an
average of 15,609 dollars for a family of four in 2009 to 30,260
