<p>The problem with the electric grid is that it is inferior technology,
a crude way of carrying energy from point A to point B. Molecules work
better than electrons. We could transmit energy 10 times faster at
eighth the cost using pipelines, if we use clean gas such as H2, the
whole transmission becomes clean, safe from interruption from extreme
weather events like the one mentioned below.</p>
<hr />
<p>These storms only seem to damage power lines. No damage on pipeline
infrastructure? Not even one?</p>
<p>"During [AU Gold Coast storm] there were wind gusts upto 160 km/h,
200k lightning strikes recorded bringing down 500 power lines,
cutting electricity to 125k homes and businesses"</p>

<p>Boomers sadly raised the Gen Y who ran the risk of being as blind to
the world around them just as the boomers were.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was probably easy selling anti-government sentiment to Americans.
After Watergate, Vietnam, the dozy headed bird brain boomers lost
their minds, pooh-poohed everything related to government and sold
their soul to the corporate world. And when things started to go wrong
later they still look for innuendo, mistakes "deep" within government
rather than the visible organizations that give them the sugar highs
that cloud their brains if not actively killing them with toxic
chemicals. Government can even serve as a potential controlling parental
scare figure taking the other side on the Woke debate, or censorship
debate, and of course any kind of parental presence you need to rebel
against. Avoid government, be afraid of government. Wait for Batman,
he will help you.</p>

<p>"The Hyperloop was always a scam.. A decade on, people often forget
what was really motivating the Hyperloop.. In the early 2010s, there
was a big debate around California’s plan to build a high-speed rail

automotive, and airline interests were vehemently opposed to a
technology that Japan and Europe had been living with for decades
arriving on American shores because it threatened their commercial

<p>Stiff upper lip rich class wanted to avoid EU "limitations" (such as

cheap servant class was required and they are getting them.</p>

voting in 2016 to leave the European Union. And as the coronavirus
pandemic has subsided, legal immigration has exploded. Net legal

<p>Humanity cannot conflict resolve, cannot even address genocide
happening under its own nose. Thinking that this species can peek into
the creation of the universe and theorize, reason about things
happening at that instance is ludicrous. Naturally most theories in
this domain are poppycock. The universe expansion is debunked and so
is the Big Bang. </p>

<p>We need better than human performance out of AI, we'll have to rely on
these things for automation, for patient care... A mechanical arm at a

today, 20% of the time I just won't do it". 🤨</p>

<p>GS is from a working class background, when he realized he was making
money by betting inequality would make things worse I think it got to
him, quit his job, started talking about econ from outside.</p>

<p>They can make billions frm that trade alone. If you know rate will be
2% but consensus is 1% trader can trade on that arbitrage, pocket
the difference.</p>
<hr />
<p>Apparently Gary Stevenson was an interest rate trader at Citibank.
Seriously that's what the guy did, his job, was trying to predict
interest rates one year ahead. But think about what that entails;
growth, debt, deficit, basically knowing how the economy is going to
be in one year because all that ties into rates. If econ is good, CB
will raise, if bad, will lower. Not an easy job.</p>

<p>"The recent ["AI"] transfer of [the movie] <em>True Lies</em> shows that some
people need their deep learning algorithms taken away from them... The
transfer.. has a truly vile quality to it, a feeling like someone
clandestinely dosed you with LSD just a hair below the threshold. At
times it can look passable in motion, but then you notice something
out of the corner of your eye: a thick fold of skin, a framed photo of
a child, folders that are too thick at the margins, cheeks that look
rendered. It’s that familiar dread at the pit of your gut when you
spot AI generated imagery, a combination of edges not looking quite
right and surfaces that are simultaneously too smooth and too sharp. A
crime was committed here, and you can tell"</p>

<p>Richard Murphy: "How did we reach the point where our society has
failed so badly that malnutrition is now a first world
problem?.. industries like big pharma and big sugar-based food
production have been allowed to prosper. Superficially satisfying
short-term sugar spikes have replaced vitamins and essential minerals
in too many affordable diets...</p>
<p>So, how to solve this? The answer is straightforward. The requirement
is regulation to demand better food whilst cutting sugar from
diets. It could be done. But the resulting foods are not addictive,
when sugar is. The result is there is less profit in them, because
nothing is more addictive than hooking people on products destructive
to their wellbeing... [but our] current health secretary is,
staggeringly, married to the Chair of British Sugar"</p>

<p>Annual changes in the housing stock (percentage), on average, looks
higher than population change. There are enough housing units, but top
10% is likely hoarding them, some people cannot find places to
live. We can regulate home ownership - mandate so that noone can own
more than one home, or a patch of land bigger than enough to live on,
for individuals or business alike, including farming. The rest becomes
public property.</p>
