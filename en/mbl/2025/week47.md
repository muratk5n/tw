Parampil, *Corporate Coup*: "For multinational corporations seeking
favorable rulings against sovereign governments for the 'crime' of
reclaiming their land and resources, the venue of choice was the
DC-based International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes
tribunal (ICSID). Though ICSID described itself as “an independent,
depoliticized and eﬀective” institution, it was overwhelmingly partial
to Western ﬁnancial interests in practice. Andrés Arauz, an economist
and former Ecuadorian presidential candidate who narrowly lost to
millionaire banker Guillermo Lasso in 2021, became well acquainted
with ICSID’s inner workings during his tenure in the leftist
government of Rafael Correa.  'ICSID is not an independent arbitrator
of justice,' he explained to me. 'ICSID is a neocolonial gatekeeper of
transnational corporate impunity.'

---

Kennard, *Silent Coup*: "From El Salvador to South Africa – where we
would go next – we’d hear a variation of the same thing: that surely
the government officials who signed up to the international
investor-state legal system [ICSID] didn’t know what they were getting
into. They couldn’t have known that their countries’ independence
would be at stake, when they ceded power to this system and its
treaties and its tribunals.  But it was clear, in black and white on
our tray tables: some did know from the start, and make their concerns
clear. A bloc of developing countries had opposed it, to defend their
sovereignty. The system was set up despite this."

---

ICSID is worse than the mafia. "Worse" in the sense that Gen. Smedley
Butler's statement what he'd done for US capitalism was worse than Al
Capone's crimes ("The best he could do was to operate his racket in
three districts. I operated on three continents"). Butler was the most
decorated Marine in US history, and he concluded his service had no
honor. He fought in the service of cocksuckers, bunch of greedy
investors.

1977-06-15
 Indiana (northern; outside sawmill), IN
2 hours of missing time with us having know idea where we wereWe where going to
sawmill lake to pick up a bed from a cabin my husbands grandmother was selling.
We were traveling in a large pickup truck. my husband and his grand mother were
in the cab with my infant son.  my daughter who was five and myself were inside
a camper shell that had heavy curtains at the windows. My husband stopped 10
minutes from the cabin because my son needed to be nursed.   When ((name deleted
--husband)) gave me ((name deleted--son)) he assured me we were just minutes
from the cabin, because he was worried about my comfort in the back of the
truck. Two hours later we were at the same stop sign only coming from another
direction.   Again, he was at the back of the camper telling me he did not know
where we had been.  His grandmother said she had never been lost before and she
had be going up there for fifty years.  We called it our time in the twilight
zone and forgot about it till I picked up a book by bud hopkins and became so
scared i could not read it.  so my husband finally asked to see the book after a
awhile he came to me and said the reason  i was so frighten was because that it
happened to us.  if you want to talk to my exhusband at some point i can give
you my son's e-mail address.  also,in the early 60's there was a sighting with
several people out side of rome city, in.  the craft was so slow that it was at
tree top level it was shaped like a saucer with no noise, i left my parents and
walked under the craft and it had a tripod of lights and it made the noise like
a clicking like it was taken pictures.   my mother  watched it for several hours
and she stated that it beamed down a blue light over the water for about a half
hour then took off at a high rate of speedn((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates
that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))

Robert Close: "Books on quantum mechanics often point out that the
theory explains phenomena that had not previously been explained by
classical physics. This is true. But one should ask *why* classical
physics failed to explain these phenomena. Was it because classical
models are intrinsically ill‐suited to describing nature? Or was it
because realistic classical models were too complicated for physicists
to analyze?

The historical evidence points to the latter explanation. The earliest
conception of the aether consistent with the behavior of light waves
was Thomas Young’s observation that light seemed to behave like
transverse waves in an elastic solid.  This theory was successfully
applied to the study of light by a host of now‐famous 19th century
scientists, with contributions from Boussinesq, Cauchy, Fresnel,
Green, MacCullagh, Navier, Stokes, Rayleigh, Riemann, Thompson (Lord
Kelvin), and others (Maxwell used a more complicated aether model to
derive the equations of electromagnetism). Yet in spite of the elastic
solid’s conceptual simplicity, and the extensive effort spent
analyzing it, no exact description of its physical behavior could be
produced. The reason for this failure is the non‐Abelian nature of
finite rotations. Nineteenth‐century scientists did not have the
mathematical tools needed to describe arbitrary variations of
orientation, and even modern condensed matter theorists have shied
away from the attempt (Kleinert 1989).  Today, the mathematics of
rotations is well‐understood for quantum mechanical systems. This fact
makes it reasonable to suppose that rotations in classical elastic
solids might also be described by similar mathematics"

Rashkovskiy: "Are there photons in fact? There are two opposing points
of view on the nature of light: the first one manifests the
wave-particle duality as a fundamental property of the nature; the
second one claims that photons do not exist and the light is a
continuous classical wave, while the so-called “quantum” properties of
this field appear only as a result of its interaction with matter. In
this paper we show that many quantum phenomena which are traditionally
described by quantum electrodynamics can be described if light is
considered within the limits of classical electrodynamics without
quantization of radiation. These phenomena include the double-slit
experiment, the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, the Hanbury
Brown and Twiss effect, the so-called multiphoton ionisation of atoms,
etc. We show that this point of view allows also explaining the
“wave-particle duality” of light in Wiener experiments with standing
waves. We show that the Born rule for light can easily be derived from
Fermi’s golden rule as an approximation for low-intense light or for
short exposure time. We show that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
for “photons” has a simple classical sense and cannot be considered as
a fundamental limitation of accuracy of simultaneous measurements of
position and momentum or time and energy. We conclude that the concept
of a “photon” is superfluous in explanation of light-matter
interactions"

The code above can replicate the simulation described below.  The
graph looks like Rashkovskiy's Figure 1. So using the formulas he is
describing, one can obtain the interference pattern that Copenhagen QM
folk thought they needed wave-particle duality to explain. 

---

Rashkovskiy: "Here, I show that the double-slit experiment can be
easily explained in terms of classical electrodynamics if we take into
account the discrete structure of matter (a screen, a detector) and
the specific nature of the interaction of light with matter, which is
described by the Schrodinger equation (or other wave equation of
quantum mechanics)... The calculation proceeds using the Monte Carlo
method: at each time, the probability of excitation of each unexcited
(non-ionised) atom will be calculated. The calculation for each atom
is continued until its excitation (ionisation) occurs.. Comparing
Fig. 1 with the real picture of the “accumulation of photons” on the
photographic plate in the double-slit experiment, we see that the
calculated pattern is completely consistent with the experimental
interference pattern and the model completely reproduces the results
of these experiments"

Pikkety, *A Brief History of Equality*: "Here we must underline
another essential lesson to be learned from the period 1914–1980,
namely that fiscal progressivity made it possible to reduce
inequalities not only ­after taxes, but also and especially before
taxes (sometimes called *predistribution*, in contrast to
redistribution)... Concretely, the 80–90 ­percent tax rates
implemented under Roosevelt and during the postwar period led
companies to put an end to the most astronomical remunerations, whose
cost increasingly appeared to be excessive when compared with the real
benefit to the man­ag­er and with alternative uses. ­These
super-remunerations melted away, which left more funds to be invested
and used to raise lower salaries. The data show that the
redistributive effect of confiscatory tax rates was principally the
result of predistribution, which also implies that a simple
examination of the effective tax rates paid by the various centiles
allows us to mea­sure only part of the total effect."

---

"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social

There's a fascinating analysis of the actual effects of very high
marginal tax rates in Thomas Piketty's 'Brief History of Equality':
it's 'predistribution'. Companies simply stop paying out very high
salaries, dividends etc, and instead reinvest profits - and this was
in fact one of the reasons we had both higher growth and higher
marginal tax rates together in the post-war period, and why when
Reagan and Thatcher came in and started to lower tax, it gradually
strangled growth."

Nowadays ppl refer to TAD when they cannot afford something... That
means the enterpreneurship angle of the phrase is irrelevant. If you
expect regular people to be able to afford basic necessities, you are
saying an average person working at an average job should be able to
afford things to survive, without being a mega grinder and a hustler,
then The American Dream is a middle / working class statement. But
perhaps it had always been so... US, with its vast land provided
opportunities that would have clouded the true meaning of the phrase..
Land was plenty and cheap, u could build a shack on it, it was easy.
Now that there are many layers of gatekeepers to get to your
necessities, the roadblocks become obvious.

---

Wiki: "The 'American Dream' is a phrase referring to a purported
national ethos of the United States: that every person has the freedom
and opportunity to succeed and attain a better life.. Originally, the
emphasis was on democracy, liberty, and equality, but more recently
has been on achieving material wealth and upward social mobility"

Sergey A. Rashkovskiy: "Quantum mechanics without quanta.. In this
paper, I argue that light is a continuous classical electromagnetic
wave, while the observed so-called quantum nature of the interaction
of light with matter is connected to the discrete (atomic) structure
of matter and to the specific nature of the light-atom interaction.
From this point of view, the Born rule for light is derived, and the
double-slit experiment is analysed in detail. I show that the
double-slit experiment can be explained without using the concept of a
“photon”, solely on the basis of classical electrodynamics. I show
that within this framework, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for a
“photon” has a simple physical meaning not related to the fundamental
limitations in accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of position
and momentum or time and energy. I argue also that we can avoid the
paradoxes connected with the wave-particle duality of the electron if
we consider some classical wave field - “an electron wave” - instead
of electrons as the particles and consider the wave equations (Dirac,
Klein-Gordon, Pauli and Schrödinger) as the field equations similar to
Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field. It is shown that such
an electron field must have an electric charge, an intrinsic angular
momentum and an intrinsic magnetic moment continuously distributed in
the space. It is shown that from this perspective, the double-slit
experiment for “electrons”, the Born rule, the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle and the Compton effect all have a simple explanation within
classical field theory. The proposed perspective allows consideration
of quantum mechanics not as a theory of particles but as a classical
field theory similar to Maxwell electrodynamics"

IC: "A March 2025 report by the American Physical Society found that

effective missile defense have been solved, and… many of the hard
problems we identified are likely to remain so during and probably
beyond'...

Proponents of the Golden Dome project argue that it’s now
feasible because of new technologies being developed in Silicon
Valley, from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. Those
claims are, of course, unproven, and past experience suggests that
there is no miracle technological solution to complex security

I remember one UKIP kerkuffle during the days of Brexit, one UKIP guy
told off a black British person "why don't you go back to

say..

But in US, if powers that be let it happen, there could've been a
Blackland, a black version of everything. It's a big joke now, Eddie
Murphy's "black Pavarotti", or the Jamie Foxx line in a movie "black
Spiderman". But there nearly was black city, in a potentially black
state, Tulsa, Ohio. This town already had a "Black Wall Street", as it
was called back then.  But after some race riots the place was
destroyed. USG probably did not want a city, or a state, smack in the
middle of America that could one day seperate itself, or act like a
fifth column against it. So they destroyed it. Integration was more
preferable compared to an ethnic state within USA.

Many in US who are labeled racist, or Nazi are actually, at most, a

TAC: "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is rebuilding his status among
conservatives. The governor was once the darling of right-wing media
and touted as the man to replace President Donald Trump as the leader
of the American Right. His failed presidential bid sunk his starry
reputation and made it appear his political career would end along
with his term as Florida governor. But DeSantis has not given up hope
for another go at the White House...

While DeSantis’s other issues are crafted to make the governor seem
new and different from past conservatives, his stance on Israel will
be resolutely standard fare. Other hopefuls question America’s current
relationship with Israel, but DeSantis insists our civilization
depends on firm support for the foreign nation...

This could be a wedge issue for him to separate himself from
Vance. While Vance supports Israel, DeSantis could follow the lead of
some conservative commentators who try to attack the vice president
due to his association with Tucker Carlson, MAGA’s most prominent
critic of Israel. DeSantis could compete for donor support by
presenting himself as the true friend of Israel, unlike Tucker friend
J.D. Vance.

This stance will undermine his effort to appeal to the Online Right,
but that effect may be offset by greater support from the conservative
establishment"

Steinberg and co demonstrated continuous, smooth average flow paths.
That can support the wave-only interpretation of Robert Close. Per
aether model if photons are continuous wave structures (solitons), the
'average trajectories' might be the energy flow through the elastic
soup, then the discrete detection events are wave-detector
interactions. IOW the weak measurements are revealing the underlying
continuous wave nature that standard strong measurements cannot pick
up.

---

"Steinberg and colleagues found a way to measure the average
trajectories of many photons going through the two slits.  To do that,
they used a weak-measurement function of photons emerging from an
optical ﬁber. That’s something that generations of physicists have
learned cannot be done, as standard measurements reveal only the size
or 'amplitude' of the wave function and not its full mathematical
complexity"

Chantal Roth: "Using simulations and classical field theory (inspired

how familiar 'quantum' outcomes like spin-½ and Stern-Gerlach
splitting can arise from deterministic wave evolution. I also explore
the idea that gravity is a form of refraction and that space
contraction and time dilation are natural wave effects.

This ontological approach offers intuitive explanations, and may help
bridge the gap between quantum theory and general relativity..

In this model, both the Schrödinger equation and also the Dirac
equation have a real physical meaning, that is quantum physics has an
underlying reality and a wave function is not just a probability
density, but consists of actual deformations in an elastic solid – our
universe. This elastic solid can be thought of as the 'fabric of
space'"

 Cave Springs, GA
 In 1864, prior to airplanes, a white object was observed about half a
mile high and moving rapidly toward the south.A Confederate soldier's
war journal was published as "Blood & Sacrifice," by Blue Acorn Press,
Huntington, WV in 1994.On Page 140, the author reports, "Prior to our
arrival at Cave Springs, quite early in the forenoon in fact, a white
object was observed in the sky to the southeast, apparently about half
a mile high and moving rapidly toward the south.  We decided that it
was a balloon, and that the enemy was endeavoring by that means to
ascertain the strength of the reinforcements that were coming to
Gen. Johnston." The book editor notes that Union General Sherman's
troops did not have balloons with them on the Atlanta Campaign.  It
should also be noted that observation balloons were tied to the ground
and only moved vertically up and down.  If a balloon were untethered
by accident, it would only move as fast as any winds prevailing at the
time, or certainly not "rapidly." The observer (book author) was a
Sergeant in Company B, 46th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, and later
Sergeant Major, and finally Acting Adjutant of the Regiment.  He had
been a school teacher prior to the War Between The States, and the
book is a very factual chronology of his daily experiences during the
War.((NUFORC Note: We express our sincere gratitude to the individual
who took the time, and trouble, to submit this report.  Indeed, there

We should name wars after the company that profits most from it. Like
the second Iraq War should be named as "The Haliburton Iraq War". The

---

"Brown & Roots was a Texas-based defense contractor many see as one of
the leading companies profiting during the Vietnam War. Brown & Roots,
also known as Kellogg Brown & Root, was a Texas-based company known
for giving U.S. President Lyndon Johnson a blank cheque when he ran
for the U.S. Senate. Because of President Johnson’s connection to
Brown & Roots and how the war escalated under President Johnson, many
believe that Pres. Johnson and Brown & Roots worked together on the
war to ensure it continued and was profitable."

Fukuyama.. The sudden chaos caused by US-led invasions in Iraq and

argued discourse on public administration, *State Building: Governance
and World Order in the 21st Century*, released in 2004. This was a
deep meditation on the institutional requirements for effective
state-building; Fukuyama directly questioned the international
community’s emphasis on democracy over the brick and mortar of public
administration in Iraq and Afghanistan."
