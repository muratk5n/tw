Miran is describing today's situation exactly. When US was supplying
the reserve currency when the world econ was small, there was no
problem. But today, where US represents only a quarter of global GDP,
problems started to arise.

---

Miran, *Maga Lago Accords*: "[Today's trade situation] reflect what
can be described as a 'Triffin world,' after Belgian economist Robert
Triffin. In Triffin world, reserve assets are a form of global money
supply, and demand for them is a function of global trade and savings,
not the domestic trade balance or return characteristics of the
reserve nation.  When the reserve country is large relative to the
rest of the world, there are no significant externalities imposed on
the reserve country from its reserve status. The distance from the
Triffin equilibrium to the trade equilibrium is small. However, when
the reserve country is smaller relative to the rest of the world—say,
because global growth exceeds the reserve country’s growth for a long
period of time—tensions build and the distance between the Triffin
equilibrium and the trade equilibrium can be quite large. Demand for
reserve assets leads to significant currency overvaluation with real
economic consequences"

The timeline, events leading up to Watergate makes it clear, the leaks
started once Nixon made overtures to China, and things got worse after
the withdrawal from Vietnam.

He is right.. Nixon was likely framed. US has its private-corporate
military-industrial complex, the surface state to thank for that.

---

Entertainment Weekly: "[Bill Murray said] When I read.. the book
written by what's-his-name, Bob Woodward, about Belushi, I read like
five pages and I went, 'Oh my God, they framed Nixon,'" referencing
Woodward's role in breaking the Watergate scandal that led to the
resignation of President Richard Nixon.. 'if he writes about my friend
that I've known for half of my adult life — talking to the people of
the outer, outer circle — what the hell could they have done to
Nixon?'"

Words matter. The Israeli military did not 'intercept a ship and
escort it to safety.' The Israeli military did commit a violent act of
piracy against a UK flagged vessel in international waters as it
fulfilled a legal right to reach Gaza and alleviate suffering, then
abducted its crew and transported them by force to Israel under threat
of execution.

Not a single corporate media outlet has had the courage or integrity
to correctly label this horrific injustice. Legacy media has failed us
all."

Chollet: "Beyond the perhaps superficial semantic distinction between
'reasoning' and 'pattern matching', there is a fundamental gap in the
practical capabilities and behavior of these systems. You don't create
an invention machine by iterating on an automation machine.

The reason we care about 'reasoning' is because of what it
enables. It's not about definitions, it's about capabilities. You can
use pattern matching to emulate specific well-known skills but you
cannot use pattern matching to produce autonomous skill acquisition in
new domains"

The UA/UK attack on the Russian aircraft was designed to portray
Ukraine still as "war worthy", worth to spend money on. The attack, as
the overall war, benefits arms manufacturers as it can lengthen the
war, earning them more money. This war makes Russia stronger, they
know that, but war strengthens the wallet of certain someones for sure
and thats what they really like.. their strong wallet

deliver more bad news to voters."

Some of Italian descent look and say "these immigrants remind me of my
parents". They are not like your parents. Your parents arrived via the
Immigration Act of 1924. These immigrants arrived by the order of
Charles and David Koch. Businessmen wanted cheap, compliant workers
(whose very existence undermine left movements) and they got them.

Pay attention to the people who passed NAFTA, and their ilk, who want
wide open borders - they are the same people who also kicked off a
massive wave of immigration.

Global march to Gaza

More than 150 NGOs & movements from 36 countries have endorsed the

to demand the end of Israel’s siege & the opening of a humanitarian

E-douche was seen to be incompetent, unable to deliver by many in the
Trump admin. Trillions were not saved, and Reps suffered a loss on the
Wisconsin SC election after millions spent. Eventually he was let
go.. What made it worse though he was sonned on the way out, with a
consolatory pat-on-the-back, a humiliating sight. E-douche tried to
rescue his shattered pride by picking up a fight on a different issue
later, to shift the narrative from his incompetence to seemingly other
disagreements so his exit would make sense to his followers. But the
damage was already done. People's perception of the cunt was
irreversibly altered.

An engineer was fired from Douche after telling *Fast Company*.. "the
federal workforce had turned out to be way more efficient than he
anticipated" 😂 😂

Stephen Miran: "[2024] [P]ersistent overvaluation of the dollar is the
key mechanism for trade imbalances, keeping imports from abroad
stubbornly cheap despite widening trade deficits. So how is it
possible that currency markets, which are the largest markets in the
world in terms of sheer trading volume, don’t equilibrate?

The answer lies in the fact that there are (at least) two concepts of
equilibrium for currencies. One is rooted in models of international
trade. In trade models, currencies adjust over the long term to
balance international trade. If a country runs a trade surplus for a
sustained period, it receives foreign currency for its goods, which it
then sells for its domestic currency, pushing its domestic currency
higher. That process occurs until its currency is strong enough that
its exports decline and imports increase, balancing trade.

The other equilibrium concept is financial and comes from savers
selecting investment alternatives among different nations. In this
equilibrium concept, currencies adjust to make investors indifferent
between holding assets denominated in different currencies, on an ex
ante risk-adjusted basis.

However, the latter class of models becomes more complicated when a
nation’s currency is a reserve asset, as is America’s. Because America
provides reserve assets to the world, there is demand for U.S. dollars
(USD) and U.S.  Treasury securities (USTs) that is not rooted in
balancing trade or in optimizing risk-adjusted returns. These reserve
functions serve to facilitate international trade and provide a
vehicle for large pools of savings, often held for policy reasons
(e.g. reserve or currency management or sovereign wealth funds) rather
than return maximization.  Much (but not all) of the reserve demand
for USDs and USTs is inelastic with respect to economic or investment
fundamentals. Treasurys bought to collateralize trade between
Micronesia and Polynesia are bought irrespective of the U.S. trade
balance with either, the latest jobs report, or the relative return of
Treasurys vs. German Bunds"

SciTechDaily: "Researchers at the University of Sharjah have developed
a new technology that can produce clean hydrogen fuel directly from
seawater, and at an industrial scale... In a study published.. the
team reported that they were able to extract hydrogen without removing
the mineral salts found in seawater or adding any chemicals.

The researchers say the method eliminates the need for desalination
plants, which are expensive to build and operate, often costing
hundreds of millions of dollars... 'We developed a novel,
multi-layered electrode that can extract hydrogen directly from
seawater efficiently and sustainably. Traditional methods face a host
of problems, mainly corrosion and performance degradation caused by
chloride ions in seawater,' said Dr. Tanveer Ul Haq.. the study’s lead
author. The team designed a custom-built electrode that, according to
Dr. Ul Haq, “overcomes these issues by creating a protective and
reactive microenvironment that boosts performance while resisting
damage.”
