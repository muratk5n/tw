<h1>Week 17</h1>
<p>"All credit is printed money". Guy thinks he discovered the 8th wonder
of the world w/ that observation. That doesn't solve the
problem. Money, printed or not, can pile up on someone's account, now
the wealthy, causing massive inequality reducing everyone's living
standards. Excess wealth will chase assets, if it buys mortgage debt
it will increase the price of the underlying asset which is precisely
what happened before the GFC. Now the median house nearly costs half a
million <em>freaking</em> dollars.</p>
<p>Governments must tax for rebalancing. Useless observations like one
above are so inane they create opportunities for ideological arbitrage
which the wealthy will happily exploit. They will push faux leftist
spending wout taxation - all printed money flows to them anyway, and
they remain wealthy.</p>

<p>Economic Times: "Vincent Lyne, a researcher from the University of
Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, claims to have
located the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370. The plane, which
disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board, was allegedly flown
intentionally into a 20,000-foot-deep chasm in the Indian Ocean known
as the Broken Ridge. Lyne's research..  suggests that the
disappearance was a result of meticulous planning and not an
accident... [Lyne] believes the plane was intentionally flown into a
deep chasm in the Indian Ocean. [He] suggests that previous searches
missed the mark due to incorrect assumptions about the aircraft's
final moments... Lyne identified a 6000-meter hole at the eastern end
of the Broken Ridge as the likely resting place of MH370. He described
the area as a hazardous ocean habitat filled with deep pits of fine
sediments and narrow, steep sides surrounded by enormous hills.</p>
<p>Lyne's theory contradicts the earlier notion of a rapid plunge due to
lack of fuel. Instead, he proposed a 'controlled ditching' akin to
Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's 2009 landing on the Hudson
River, with the plane's wings, flaps, and flaperon damages supporting
this scenario"</p>
<hr />
<p>Researcher Lyne disputes the last moments of the plane, the data on
the "7th arc" (which most pre-2018-data analysis used), says that last
ping should not be trusted.</p>

<p>Zeihan: "[T]he absolute lowest grade for silicon as an actual
industrial input is 99.95 percent pure.  Getting there requires a
blast furnace, which typically requires a lot of coal.  Overall, the
process isn’t all that complicated—you basically just bake the quartz
until anything that is not silicon burns away—which means some 90
percent of this firststep processing tends to be done in countries
like Russia and China, countries with a lot of surplus industrial
capacity that don’t [care] about environmental issues...</p>
<p>The 99.95 percent purity of 'standard' silicon isn’t anywhere enough
[for solar panels]. A second round in the blast furnace gets the
silicon up to 99.99999 percent pure. Round two is far more
sophisticated than round one’s bake-it-pure. China’s GCL Group is the
only Chinese entity that can manage such precision at scale, making it
responsible for one-third of global supply. The rest comes from a
smattering of developed-world companies.  This pure silicon is
incorporated into the solar cells that make solar panels do their
thing"</p>
<hr />
<p>CleanTechnica: "China’s coal-fired electricity generation took an
unexpectedly sharp turn downward in the first quarter of 2025,
signaling a potentially profound shift in the world’s largest
coal-consuming economy. This wasn’t merely a seasonal dip or economic
distress signal; rather, it represented a clear and structural turning
point. Coal generation fell by approximately 4.7% year over year,
significantly outpacing the overall grid electricity supply decline of
just 1.3%. However, electricity demand, a better measure, went up by
1%. What gives?...</p>
<p>China put in place a Whole County Rooftop Solar Promotion
Program. Developers had to bid on an entire county’s rooftop solar at
once, committing to putting solar on 50% of government buildings, 40%
of public institutions, 30% of commercial and industrial rooftops, and
20% of rural homes. That’s paid off massively in the densely populated
southeast of the country where demand is highest and free space is
lowest...</p>
<p>As a result, tens of terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity generated by
these rooftop systems are effectively invisible when interpreting
China’s national grid-supplied electricity data. This has profound
implications: the reported 1.3% decline in grid electricity generation
does not represent true reduced consumption, but rather a substitution
effect—electricity generated behind the meter directly displacing
grid-supplied power... Given that China’s reported 1.3% drop in
grid-delivered electricity in early 2025 equates to roughly 30 TWh
less generation, it’s reasonable to conclude that this hidden solar
growth alone might account for much, if not all, of the decline"</p>

<p>Ledbetter, <em>Unwarranted Influence</em>: "The last years of [Ike's]
presidency were marked by deep, often bitter conflicts with Congress
over the military and national security... These conflicts came to a
head in the fall of 1957, with the one-two punch of the Soviet Sputnik
launch and the near-simultaneous release of a report arguing that the
United States would soon fall behind the Soviets in the production of
atomic weapons...</p>
<p>The launch of the Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957, hit the
Eisenhower White House like a targeted missile. Whether it represented
a scientific breakthrough for the Soviet Union is a matter that can
still be debated. But as a public relations coup, it unsettled the
administration more than any other event... </p>
<p>While the public was focused on the two Sputnik launches, Washington’s
elite was arguably more devastated by the release of an exceptionally
well-timed panel study — delivered four days after the second Sputnik
orbit — that appeared to show the Soviet military threat was even
greater than the administration thought. Entitled 'Deterrence &amp;
Survival in the Nuclear Age,' it was known informally as the Gaither
Report, after its panel chairman, H. Rowan Gaither of the RAND
Corporation. The report —classified top secret— cited 'spectacular
progress' in Soviet military development after World War II.  The
Soviets, the authors claimed, had enough fissionable material for
fifteen hundred atomic weapons and had 'probably surpassed' the United
States in the production of nuclear-tipped intercontinental
missiles. They proposed a massive military spending program that
would...  match the alleged Soviet offensive capabilities..</p>
<p>The period following the Sputnik-Gaither crisis demonstrates
Eisenhower’s military-industrial-complex critique in its early
stages. [W]ho was behind the faulty intelligence and calls for
military buildup in the Gaither Report? The leadership consisted of
known and trusted Eisenhower advisors, but there could be no hiding
the fact that the billions in increased military spending called for
by the panel would benefit many of the very people making the
recommendations. Two of the report’s principal directors were Robert
C. Sprague, who headed his own business of military electronics, and
William C. Foster of the Olin-Mathiesen Chemical Company, a producer
of gunpowder and ammunition"</p>
