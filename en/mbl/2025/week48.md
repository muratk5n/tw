# Week 48



"@trashpanda@m.alittlenook.net

Many years ago I myself lived off $50 a month. I had assistance (SNAP,
medicaid, a roof), so it wasn't 50 + nothing. But ~50 was my taxable
income.

I could never sell plasma, because of some medical stuff, but I have
friends still routinely sell plasma. This kind of poverty is very real
and present. I'm actually really bothered by how much of the tech
world (obviously not you three) are so completely shielded from it."

---

Stanford: "Jessica Compton’s family of four would have no cash income
unless she donated plasma twice a week at her local donation center in
Tennessee. Modonna Harris and her teenage daughter Brianna in Chicago
often have no food but spoiled milk on weekends. After two decades of
brilliant research on American poverty, Kathryn Edin noticed something
she hadn’t seen since the mid-1990s — households surviving on
virtually no income. Edin teamed with Luke Shaefer, an expert on
calculating incomes of the poor, to discover that the number of
American families living on $2.00 per person, per day, has skyrocketed
to 1.5 million American households, including about 3 million
children."

Green: "Our entire safety net is designed to catch people at the very
bottom, but it sets a trap for anyone trying to climb out. As income
rises from $40,000 to 100,000, benefits disappear faster than wages
increase...

- The View from $35,000 (The “Official” Poor)

At this income, the family is struggling, but the state provides a
floor. They qualify for Medicaid (free healthcare). They receive SNAP
(food stamps). They receive heavy childcare subsidies. Their deficits
are real, but capped.

- The Cliff at $45,000 (The Healthcare Trap)

The family earns a $10,000 raise. Good news? No. At this level, the
parents lose Medicaid eligibility. Suddenly, they must pay premiums
and deductibles.

Income Gain: +$10,000

Expense Increase: +$10,567

Net Result: They are poorer than before. The effective tax on this
mobility is over 100%.

- The Cliff at $65,000 (The Childcare Trap)

This is the breaker. The family works harder. They get promoted to
$65,000. They are now solidly “Working Class.”

But at roughly this level, childcare subsidies vanish. They must now
pay the full market rate for daycare.

Income Gain: +$20,000 (from 45k)

Expense Increase: +$28,000 (jumping from co-pays to full tuition)

Net Result: Total collapse.

When you run the net-income numbers, a family earning $100,000 is
effectively in a worse monthly financial position than a family
earning 40,000...

The anger isn’t about the goods. It’s about the breach of
contract. The American Deal was that Effort ~ Security. Effort brought
your Hope strike [a finance term] closer. But.. effort no longer
yields security or progress; it brings risk, exhaustion, and debt"

---

Michael Green: "[E]verything changed between 1963 and 2024. Housing
costs exploded. Healthcare became the largest household expense for
many families. Employer coverage shrank while deductibles
grew. Childcare became a market, and that market became ruinously
expensive. College went from affordable to crippling. Transportation
costs rose as cities sprawled and public transit withered under
government neglect.

The labor model shifted. A second income became mandatory to maintain
the standard of living that one income formerly provided. But a second
income meant childcare became mandatory, which meant two cars became
mandatory. Or maybe you’d simply be 'asking for a lot generationally
speaking' because living near your parents helps to defray those
childcare costs.. Housing now consumes 35 to 45 percent. Healthcare
takes 15 to 25 percent. Childcare, for families with young children,
can eat 20 to 40 percent...

[Some can] tell you that comparing 1955 to 2024 is unfair because cars
today have airbags, homes have air conditioning, and phones are
supercomputers. I will argue that because the quality of the good
improved, the real price dropped... [That is] a category error. We are
not calculating the price of luxury. We are calculating the price of
participation.

To function in 1955 society—to have a job, call a doctor, and be a
citizen—you needed a telephone line. That “Participation Ticket” cost
$5 a month.

Adjusted for standard inflation, that $5 should be 58 today.

But you cannot run a household in 2024 on a $58 landline. To function
today—to factor authenticate your bank account, to answer work emails,
to check your child’s school portal (which is now digital-only)—you
need a smartphone plan and home broadband.

The cost of that 'Participation Ticket' for a family of four is not
$58. It’s 200 a month.

The economists say, “But look at the computing power you get!”

I say, 'Look at the computing power I need!'

The utility I’m buying is 'connection to the economy.' The price of
that utility didn’t just keep pace with inflation; it tripled relative
to it."

That assumes there are many high-paying jobs outside big
cities... Inequality tilts the economy towards the rich, so best
paying jobs will be in and around areas servicing them.. Alas those
areas are precisely those rich "vibrant" cities, to use a Thomas Frank
term, regions with a lot of economic activity, concentration. Workers
can't simply pack up and move to Buttfuckee Idaho and expect to earn a
good salary right away.

Russia envoy's call is leaked, clearly instigated by the MIC, the

have to be to still be stuck on your "bad Putin" position and
completely miss what is going on?

If Dems are still hurting from 2016, well, actually they should be
*thankful* to Trump for beating Hillary, a centrist pro-corporate
Democrat (and worse, a Clinton). Whatever they accuse Trump for doing
since then, I guarantee it with another Clinton in office, things
would be ten times worse.

Car Batteries.. Lead is an essential, but toxic, element of car
batteries. As demand rose, the auto industry increased its use of

An investigation by The New York Times and The Examination showed that

Pettis suggests "a new Bretton-Woods", that indirectly means
[Bancor](../../0119/2019/06/bancor.html) bcz in the last Bretton-Woods
Keynes suggested the scheme, he was ignored. In a new one maybe all
countries will accept it. Surplus countries can choose to object but
if deficit countries band together they will not have any other choice
as it is impossible to have surpluses wout someone else being in
deficit.

---

YV had a good platform during those debt negotiations, esp. in
Germany.. I was living there at the time, everyone was talking about
YV. Pettis is a former trader, that can help. I've always been more
hopeful that a new econ approach, when it arises, would arrive in the
form of a financial trader rather than an economist... We can scoff at
traders, and mostly deservedly so, but at least they test their
knowledge of the economy with trades all the time, and their narrative
is sharper.

---

Yanis Varoufuckis did talk about similar concepts as Michael Pettis,
surpluses in one country causing deficit in other countries, but he
did not elaborate on the transmission mechanisms, or why surpluses in
said countries were triggered in the first place (labor "reforms" in
Germany, inequality). YV's main issue at the time (2015) was Greece's
debt of course, but as the main negotiator he could have made a better
case, using more econ theory. He had the spotlight, but IMO the
opportunity was wasted.

Pettis is from one of the PIGS countries too (Portugal, Italy, Greece,
Spain), but his reasoning comes through clearer. You need to be able
to rattle off those accounting identities, three types of demand:
investment, consumption, trade surplus, bam. Money pours into US than
something has to happen in the investment-savings relationship, either
investment goes up or saving must come down, because the gap must go
up, etc.. Ra-ta-ta-ta. You need to outline the shit clearly. Arguments
must map to something mathematical, computations that can be verified
via data.

Consensus can make LLMs suitable for education, boilerplate code
generation. For research, hard-core development the results will be
spotty.. I stretched these things with tasks on various scientific,
coding goals, and I find there are major gaps in their thinking. Can
be useful, but not without guidance - serious guidance.

---

Zeke Hausfather: "LLMs are at their core consensus machines. We ask
LLMs a question and they give us an answer. But what they’re really
doing is picking from a distribution of possible answers that they
learned from the sum total of digitized human knowledge: the internet,
books, papers, code, etc. Call that distribution the model’s
“consensus.” It isn’t a vote of experts; it’s what the data and later
training steps make most likely given your prompt."

'Rent is too high!'

Corporate landlords bought entire neighborhoods and jacked prices so
high you need a co-signer just to breathe.

'Groceries cost too much!'

Billion-dollar food conglomerates are price-gouging you while bragging
about record profits.

'There aren’t enough jobs!'

CEOs laid off Americans to pump stock prices and walked away with
bonuses the size of small countries’ budgets...

'Traffic is terrible!'

That is what happens when everyone drives a giant truck to buy a
single iced coffee. Consumerism is wonderful, isn’t it?

'Healthcare is too expensive!'

A private insurance cartel did that. Your elected officials built that
system brick by brick...

'I can’t afford a car!'

Automakers slapped luxury prices on basic models because they know you

'I can’t afford a house!'

In US one could convert to Bahaism, there aren't that many Bahais in
the country, so no matter the label, that person and his children
would not be culturally Bahai... But via accepting Bahaism, one forces
himself to act a certain way, it is a concious choice. Cultural act is
more like a reflex. 

---

Religious affiliation is a political choice actually, it effects
concious decisions. Culture is in a different realm... I am talking
about that split-second response to events around you that arises from
the subconcious, a massively strong aspect of humans.  Those
mechanisms are wired at a very early age, and next to impossible to
change.

brought about the most significant change to British polity and
economics - brexit - without ever winning power... The lesson is that
moving the overton window your way is far more important than winning
elections."
