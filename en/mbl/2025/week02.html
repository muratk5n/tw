<p>#FediPunk is the digital gutterpunk ethos where the Fediverse thrives
in its glorious mess, held together by duct tape, user patches &amp; sheer
spite for corporate monoculture. It's not just a rejection of
surveillance capitalism, it's a hymn to chaos, a love letter to an
internet that bleeds authenticity through its flaws.</p>
<p>Here, nostalgia isn't naive. It's weaponized. It remembers the wild
promise of the early web: decentralized, anarchic &amp; gloriously
inefficient"</p>

<p>Assad is gone, if the new regime acts in bizarre ways that is still

suspects.</p>

Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST), along with Amazon.com (AMZN) supplier

Internal Revenue Service revising its rules for hydrogen production
tax credits.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury on Friday published its final rules on clean
hydrogen production, with guidelines producers must meet to qualify
for the clean hydrogen production tax credit of up to $3 per
kilogram. The move broadly gave companies clarification on whether
they could take advantage of the tax credit" </p>

after the Republican leader shared a video on his social media
platform TruthSocial featuring economist Jeffrey Sachs accusing
Netanyahu of manipulating the US foreign policy and orchestrating an
'endless war' in Gaza and the Middle East.</p>
<p>In the clip, Trump can be heard calling Netanyahu a 'deep, dark son of

<p>"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"</p>

<p>The dynamics works like this: income inequality will cause bigger
income inequality, it is a self-reinforcing process. Top 1% has more
assets than bottom 99%, rent payments, grocery payments, payments of
all kinds will flow to the rich, simply because they own assets and
the rest needs those assets to live. If imbalances are not corrected
via taxation, the rich will use those payments to <em>increase</em> their
assets which means they will receive even more payments from the
bottom. Hence the cycle, the "doom-loop" keeps going.</p>

<p>Remember Clooney in his more active, visible days, when he was
'splaining' all day what was wrong with politics.. He was repeating
that bullshit argument "Democrats and Republicans need to come
together". That's all he had.  Then bunch of other Holywood types
repeated this empty mantra, I guess they judged him as "the smart one"
(for what reason, noone knows), and followed him. I'm glad the
politics-savy Clooney figure finally imploded.</p>

<p>Hydrogen fuel cells present a compelling alternative to lithium-ion
batteries. Hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth, making it a
virtually limitless resource. Fuel cells are also ten times lighter
than lithium-ion batteries, reducing vehicle weight and associated
infrastructure wear and tear.</p>
<p>Hydrogen-powered vehicles refuel in just five minutes or so, compared
to EVs taking 45-minutes to hours. Further, the hydrogen fuel cell has
an average lifespan of 20 years and offer longer driving ranges per
refill compared to EVs. With advancements in technology, blue and
green hydrogen production costs are becoming increasingly competitive"</p>

<p>Autoencoders are not unsupervised either IMO, again the same idea, the
data itself becomes label. You are still using an architecture that
requires labels.</p>

<p>NYT: "Ireland Joins South Africa’s Genocide Case Against Israel"</p>
<hr />
<p>Notice how Israel's response to anything untoward to itself is
immediate violence. They know their protector in US very well.. Every
rocket, every bomb represents an increase in the margin of the private
complex, surface state, greedy mob of muppets who make money from
mayhem in the middle east.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's more like they want to protect Israel as the weapon-purchaser-in-chief
in its unending fight with its neighbors.. Israel is good business. Munee
needs to flow in their direction, lots of people eat from it.</p>

<p>Obviously serious researchers seeking alternatives means human level
AI will not be reached via existing approaches. They are just wasting
energy, creating bunch of junk.</p>
<hr />
<p>I would call the empty-patch approach supervised learning, it
seemingly does not require labels, but the labels are generated from
the data itself. Clustering, PCA are unsupervised, at a fundamental
level. </p>
<hr />
<p>New "AI" idea is working on a layered architecture where vision based
training starts first, a net is trained by taking out patches from
real-world images, and machinery tries to predict those empty
patches. That way the necessary internal connections are formed
representing the outside world, visually, then other learning is
layered on top...</p>
<p>Will motor function be part of that training? A big part of how we
learn the world is tied to how we move in it. When I take a big step
vs small one, I see certain visual changes in the outside world (far
points move little, near ones a lot), that is part of my understanding
of the outside world.</p>

<p>Actually I was unfair, LLMs are not as smart as an hamster.. An
hamster is still smarter than these "AI" algorithms. I meant LLM
<em>processing power</em> is similar to an hamster. But since their

creative, parroty junk. It can sound smart, but boy, when it takes a
wrong turn, it all goes down the cliff.. A hamster is absolutely
smarter than any neural network based approach currently in use.</p>
