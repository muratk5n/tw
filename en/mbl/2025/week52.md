Everything went to shit once the soviet union collapsed. The ruling
elite used to be terrified of communism doing well and turning heads
so they'd throw the plebs a few bones (health care, public services,
etc) to keep us sweet."

The General (al-Haddad) who died was the army chief of Libyan
west. The more powerful Haftar is in the east. He nearly took all of
Libya in 2020 but the al-Haddad group resisted w/ the help of Asia
Minor. Then recently TR started to pivot to Haftar. Anyone who backed
Haftar (and there are many) could've seen an opportunity to pounce
now, weaken the West and make Asia Minor look like a jackass in tbe
process, they look like they cannot even protect a guest in their own
airspace.

No need to use Komoot. Wikiloc is fine, their trail data is free to
download. You get a file in GPX format, most apps can handle it... I
have my own Web utility that can display POIs, paths from Wikiloc or
elsewhere, uses Leaflet for maps - 200 lines of code.

---

I've met some of the Komoot team some time ago.. The company never
came across tech-savy to me, now we see they were biz types too eager
to screw anyone for money.

"Imagine going for a ride on your favorite loop through your local
woods and stumbling upon a notice of an impending clear-cut. That’s
the shock many of us in the European cycling community felt when the
news broke that our trusted route platform, Komoot, was sold to the
notorious private equity group Bending Spoons on March 20th of this
year. Breaking their promise of long-term commitment to the company,
Komoot’s six founders sold out the around 150 employees, millions of
active users, and the beloved service, making off with the lion’s
share of the 300-million-euro deal...

The employees were the first to get the axe. They signed in one
morning to learn that the company many had dedicated up to 15 years of
their life to was no more. Eighty percent were fired immediately. I
spoke with a few longtime employees in the aftermath, who described it
as a rough and cruel betrayal."

IC: "What World was Jesus born into? A Historian describes the
turbulent Times of the real Nativity..  far from being a sleepy
village, Bethlehem was so significant as a town that a major aqueduct
construction brought water to its centre. Fearing Herod, Jesus’ family
fled from their home there, but they were on the wrong side of Rome
from the start.. The events that unfolded, as told by the
first-century historian Josephus, show a nation in open revolt against
Rome shortly after Jesus was born."

The Lever: "A network of arms industry-funded think tanks and media
operatives helped manufacture consent before a record-breaking $1
trillion defense budget...  Last week, the U.S. Senate joined the
House of Representatives and voted to pass a record-breaking 901
billion defense budget, in addition to the 156 billion in military
spending allocated by the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act in July. This
comes after the editorial board of The New York Times — the (generally
liberal) paper of record — recently published seven military-focused
op-eds in a single week, some of which explicitly called for more
military spending. Parroting potentially exaggerated claims of China’s
military threat, the Times board contended that, to 'prevent wars from
starting and winning them if they do,' the U.S. must expand its
military budget and '[keep] pace in these 21st-century arms races.'"

Language does not define culture but in the modern world, for
practical reasons, it helps if there is one language everyone can use
to communicate.

---

TR language today is morphed beyond recognition. It is unintelligable
to the (real) Turkics in Central Asia. Homie cannot understand an
Uygur in Xinjang.

The use of language is an administrative matter, if the military /
palace speak it, it can spread easier, esp. once the Republic made the
use of language official. Not as relevant culturally. Brits and
Americans speak the same language but their culture is
different. Georgians and Armenians speak different languages but they
have similar culture.

---

Language doesn't matter all that much. The French dote over their
language, right..? But before it (the dialect of Paris) became the
national norm, Gaul was a mish mash of distinct languages. The
standardization of French was not a natural inevitability, it was
mostly a result of politics and royal decrees. Some alternatives were
equally likely to become dominant, there was Occitan, Norman,
Franco-Provençal, Celtic..

---

Reddit: "Anatolia since being Byzantium's heartland was always densely
populated which estimated 5-6 million around that time, while Turkics
were always minority such as 250k to 500k, on the other hand, turkics
become power holder after 1071 despite being less numbered, eventually
up to early Ottoman age Turkic population estimated almost a million
while Roman/byzantine population down to around 4 million, and during
ottoman era most of Byzantines embraced islam.. so today most Turks in
Turkey have mostly anatolian by genetic[s].. while [official]
identification is related to Turkish and Islam rather than anything
else despite bigger genetic ties with Romans"

NYT: "The first draft [of the U.S.-Ukrainian Peace Plan] essentially
called for Ukraine’s surrender. The revised version includes the
security guarantees Kyiv wants to prevent future Russian
aggression.. But a Kremlin emboldened by Moscow’s advances on the
battlefield and restrained by the difficulty of selling the new plan
to the Russian public as a victory is unlikely to accept it."

NASA: "[Jupiter's moon] Europa has a salty ocean beneath its icy crust
with about twice as much water than all of Earth's oceans combined..
Models also suggest that Europa's icy shell gets stretched and
released by the tug of Jupiter's gravity as Europa orbits the giant
planet. This squeezing in and out is called tidal flexing, and it
creates heat inside Europa. In fact, the tidal flexing is likely
creating enough heat inside Europa to maintain the liquid ocean
beneath the surface...

Europa's surface is blasted by radiation from Jupiter. That's a bad
thing for life on the surface – it couldn't survive. But the radiation
may create fuel for life in an ocean below the surface... The
radiation splits apart water molecules (H2O, made of oxygen and
hydrogen) in Europa's extremely tenuous atmosphere. The hydrogen
floats away and much of the oxygen stays behind and may bind to other
elements. Oxygen is a very reactive element, which means it could
potentially be used in chemical reactions that release energy. If the
oxygen somehow makes its way to the ocean, it could react with other
chemicals to possibly provide chemical energy for microbial life."

The Guardian: "The crash occurred a day after Turkey’s parliament
passed a decision to extend the mandate of Turkish soldiers’
deployment in Libya by two more years... Turkey has militarily and
politically supported Libya’s Tripoli-based, internationally
recognised government. In 2020, it sent military personnel there to
train and support its government and later reached a maritime
demarcation accord, which has been disputed by Egypt and Greece. In
2022, Ankara and Tripoli also signed a preliminary accord on energy
exploration, which Egypt and Greece also oppose."

Why does GPU restrictions effect Chinese LLM ("AI") efforts? A lot of
training approaches in machine learning divide the training data into
batches and multiple CPUs and GPUs work on them. Many ML algos are
said to be "embarassingly parallel", ie they can be parallelized at
ease.

Then one could think if China has access to chips half as good due to
export restrictions, can't they double the number of chips and get
equal performance?  It seems one major hurdle is in the *sync* phase
of said LLM training algos. To synch they need to communicate, and
with increasing chips that communication bottleneck grows non-linearly
for LLM training. NVidia has an optimized interconnect tech for its
GPUs, Google developed its own for its TPUs, China is behind in that
regard (5-10 yrs depending on who you ask). That means China not only
needs to develop faster chips but also faster interconnect methods.

Is this a big loss? I don't think so. I don't see LLMs as a major
strategic advantage in any field. If you need focused neural net
applications you can train those stupid black boxen with less
hardware, no need for thousands of GPUs and their interconnect.

---

BTW the SOTA for recommendation algorithms are **not** neural net
based. Let that sink in. The machinery that powers "intelligent" LLMs
is not the top choice for a major area in machine learning.

Except Hinton probably, but he's gone senile... Sutskever is his
student, we can defer to him.

---

He argues research needs to focus on new AI approaches that learn how
to learn. Current LLMs are too finished, too polished in certain
tasks, and they still suck at many tasks human learn easily (like
learning chess, learning how to drive). A lot of AI heavyweights are
advocating going back to the drawing board these days.

NPR: "President Trump said the administration has reached agreements
with nine more drugmakers to bring their U.S. drug prices more in line
with what other wealthy countries pay. Fourteen companies in total
have now reached what the administration calls most-favored-nation
pricing deals. The companies that took part in Friday's announcement
were: Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech,
Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.

Top federal health officials, President Trump and Pfizer CEO Albert
Bourla meet in the Oval Office to announce an initiative on drug
prices. They agreed to charge the U.S. government no more for new
drugs than the prices paid by other well-off countries. The agreements
will allow state Medicaid programs to access lower prices from the
nine companies"
