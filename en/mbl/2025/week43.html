<hr />
<p>The Epoch Times: "China’s Fourth Plenum, which runs from Oct. 20 to
23, is expected to shape the country’s future policy direction and may
signal shifts in the top leadership.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) abruptly
announced on Oct. 17 disciplinary actions against nine top-ranking
generals, including Central Military Commission (CMC) Vice Chairman He
Weidong and former CMC Political Work Department head Miao Hua. These
generals were stripped of their Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
memberships and military positions and transferred to military
prosecutors for potential criminal charges.</p>
<p>The announcement fueled widespread speculation. He and Miao were
widely considered to be among the closest military allies of CCP
leader Xi Jinping, and the other seven were also regarded as trusted
loyalists of Xi. Their downfall has fueled talk that Xi may be
preparing—or under pressure—to voluntarily step down from his posts as
CMC chairman and top leader of the CCP during the plenum. If this is
the case, the CCP officials behind these moves—possibly CMC First Vice
Chairman Zhang Youxia and former CCP leader Hu Jintao—are likely
demanding Xi’s cooperation.</p>
<p>According to a recent leak by a Chinese whistleblower living overseas,
Zhang—who is believed to currently hold de facto military control—had
a secret meeting with Hu and former Premier Wen Jiabao, as well as
Wang Yang and Hu Chunhua. Both Wang and Hu now serve in advisory roles
within the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>Zhang allegedly briefed them on a series of unusual developments ahead
of the Fourth Plenum, including irregular changes in the Central Guard
Bureau, the frequent appearances of top Xi loyalists Cai Qi and Wang
Xiaohong at the plenum venue, and the numerous changes to security
arrangements—all of which raised fears that Xi’s faction might attempt
a last-minute move during the meeting, the whistleblower said in his
YouTube channel. Moreover, Zhang allegedly sought advice from retired
leaders on how to respond."</p>

<p>Helps to be on the lookout for viable scenarios, eg the internal CCP
conflict shared earlier.. "Yellow alert" level significant events were
1) Xi extending his presidential term years ago, 2) his humiliation of
Hu Jintao at a party conference, 3) and Covid.</p>
<p>#1 Even though China's system looks dictatorial from the outside, its
party system difuses a lot of the power from a potential unitary
leader to its members, to its commitees. Therefore anyone overriding
that system and extending his power beyond would ultimately generate
internal conflict.</p>
<p>#2 That internal conflict might have arrived through a former
president, Hu Jintao who was punished by Xi extremely harshly
signaling there might be other people like him and he had to send a
message.</p>
<p>#3 The most likely scenario for Covid was the lab-leak theory. But
that leads to the second likely scenario, someone in China
<em>intentionally</em> caused the leak. Who is that someone? Someone inside
Xi's camp or outside? Outside parties are possible.</p>
<p>All of the above puts you on alert. Then you wait for more events that
match or debunk it. </p>
<hr />
<p>#Peacemaker The ragtag quirky group of misfits which the viewer is
supposed to love of course left the government (because gov is bad,
for just being government), and became enterpreneurs, that's what
heroes, lovable people do.. (identify with the employer, not the
employed!). We saw a similar setup w/ the ultimate MCU hero Cap, he
could lift a mystical weapon "the hammer" and this hero was
anti-government - corporate moviemakers were hoping the brainwashed
viewer would then be against anything government does (brrr like
taxing the rich).</p>
<hr />
<p>The American fascination with quirkiness, diversity is mostly the
result of decades-long corporate psyop. In economic terms there are
only few groups that matter: the rich, the poor, the employer and the
employed. But if you amp up the number of groups, create a cloud of
fake diversity which are centered on social characteristic, eg Ethnic
Guy #1, Fat Guy, Ethnic Guy #2, Female #1, Deluded Jagoff #4, you are
creating a smokescreen making it look like the real (and few)
divisions do not matter. I'm not saying Gunn is conciously doing this,
but he would not be where he is if his wheelhouse was something else.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why did the new DCU make a dash for the "fighting Nazis" angle so
fast? Maybe we need to look at Gunn's preferences to understand
that.. He likes to make movies about "quirky, ragtag group of misfits"
right? That's his wheelhouse. Gunn characters are quirky,
"non-mainstream", they are "diverse" in that quirkiness.. What would
be anti-thesis of such diversity? Well the homogenizing Nazis of
course.  Enter Earth-X with its Nazi Superman (will be played
literally by a former <em>Robocop</em> actor).</p>

<hr />
<p>I had LLM "autocomplete" some machine learning code the other day. In
computer vision background extraction it is common to do analysis per
each pixel, looking at the distribution (frequency) of one single
pixel, the values it takes throughout the video. The most frequent
value can be deemed background. In a histogram that would be the
biggest bump. For 3D you can introduce a "Gaussians mixture", input is
R,G,B levels (3 values) for each pixel, to capture "the bumps" the
mixture can have 4 or 5 Gaussians (the bell curve)... They are assumed
to be combined by a weighting vector.</p>
<p>If background detection means finding the most likely value, per pixel
you must get the bump with the highest "weight". But no, LLM gave me a
<em>combined</em> value so background image ends up with "ghosts" of stuff
that had passed over that background. I had to tell LLM specificaly to
give me the max, not the mix. I cannot stress enough how stupid that
earlier choice was. I bet the LLM did that because 99% of the time the
mix is what is coded, so it wants to keep everything in that lane. It
will suggest the most widely used scenario, without understanding the
question or task.</p>

<p>Russia prefers Xi per scenario. The Hu Jintao opposition would improve
relations with the West, and be less supportive of Russia's war in
Ukraine. Wǒmen zhèng shēnghuó zài yǒuqù de shídài.</p>
<hr />
<p>This event strengthens the "Xi losing power" scenario.. One of the
leaders of the opposition is said to be Zhang Youxia (along with
former president Hu Jintao who was publicly humiliated a while back by
Xi), <em>The Spectator</em> described Youxia as "Central Military Commission
(CMC) vice chairman, [a] highly regarded military leader, a princeling
like Xi, and a rare veteran of military action in the China-Vietnam
War.. [He h]ad provided the military backing that underwrote Xi’s
taking of a third term of office. Subsequently, their relationship
faltered.".</p>
<p>The opposition is rumored to be more conciliatory towards the US.</p>
<p>The story of this internal conflict goes: Xi suffered an internal coup
back in 2024, but according to some estimates he still retains about
50% of his power, not in military but in other branches of
government.</p>
<p>Then China's rare earth move would be Xi's doing, to which US
responded in similar measure, perhaps helping the opposition. The Xi
opposition then responded with the recent military purge, as their
control in the military is much stronger.</p>
<hr />
