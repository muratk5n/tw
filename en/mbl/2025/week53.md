NYT: "China Mobilizes Forces Near Taiwan for Live-Fire Drill"

The claim is China's surplus changed character, now the surplus is w/
the 2nd/3rd world where China is the major creditor. That means China
loans *its own* currency to countries who use it to buy from China. If
true, tariffs around the world are working? The proof would be in
China's foreign currency reserves.. have they increased?

Politico: "[Newsom] made [Democrats] mad when he invited the late
conservative activist Charlie Kirk on his podcast and said 'I
completely agree with you'; on barring transgender women from
competing in women’s sports"

---

Politico: "DeSantis has emerged as a leading AI skeptic. He wants to
spend his last year as Florida governor beating back the advancement
of artificial intelligence, even as it creeps into more facets of
everyday life.

'Let’s not try to act like some type of fake videos or fake songs are
going to deliver us to some kind of utopia,' the governor said Dec. 18
during an event in Sebring."

Stepped into the breach or fell into a breach? At the eleventh hour
trying to patch up an half-assed healthcare system... It's sad. This
must be the true example of putting lipstick on a pig.

Politico: "States step into the breach as Obamacare subsidies
lapse.. [but even] state governments that want to help can’t
completely cover rising insurance premiums."

---

Politico: "Americans Hate AI. Which Party Will Benefit? It’s become a
common occurrence: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer posts a
light-hearted video on social media. She’s Christmas shopping, or
she’s talking about her Michigan accent or she’s touting her
administration’s accomplishments. And immediately, the comments start
rolling in, all demanding the same thing: Say no to data centers in
the state. Stop construction. 'All I want for Christmas is legislation
banning data centers in Michigan.'

National figures in the party are beginning to notice the anger. What
began on the ground with widespread protests against the facilities
that provide infrastructure for the growth of artificial intelligence
is finding its way into new plans, memos and rhetoric as the
Democratic Party thinks about how to win in 2026 and 2028."

I wouldn't make a big deal out of that.. he was actually trying to
stave off something much worse (as in good) - the Congress was cooking
up extreme measures to fix the trade imbalance. He was a globalist, in
many ways, the OG globalist.

"If Reagan was such a free trader why did his admin engineer the
orderly depreciation of an overvalued U.S. dollar (via the Plaza
Accord) trying to reduce a massive U.S. trade deficit back in the
80s?"

MTV died. All the cool, unique artists like off '120 minutes' are now
fighting the blandest algorithms imaginable. We wanted a place to
watch weird stuff you can’t see on mainstream channels. So….

Fedi MTV goes live in ONE HOUR."

Reddit: ""Does 'drifting' [with cars] really make you take corners
faster than 'gripping'...? [No] If it was, surely the best drifters
would have record lap times on a track somewhere? Drifting is the
figure skating of motorsports"

Watching Nobel Minds on BBC. The winners sit around the table talk
about their work.. The dumbest among them is always the
economist.. Wah wah wah, yapping abt some shit with little or no
science in it.. They stick out like a sore thumb. No wonder Alfred
Nobel did not include economics in the Prize, they came in through the
backdoor, thanks to Sweden Central Bank. The econ prize has mostly
been used to push the neolib agenda, 1997 being its worst year.

*A Hologram for the King*.. not bad. China was indirectly part of the
story, the movie caught a piece of the zeitgeist (2015). Later 2016
happened, more saw the zeitgeist up close.

Science.org: "Architects of molecular cages win Chemistry Nobel..  As
early as the 18th century, people knew the pigment Prussian Blue had
the mysterious ability to absorb and hold water. Its structure,
deciphered much later, showed the compound was, in fact, a molecular
cage: a cubic arrangement of iron ions joined by nitrile groups
(carbon and nitrogen linked by a triple bond).

This year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry has gone to three researchers who
pioneered modern versions of these porous structures by using organic
molecules as struts to link up metal atoms. These metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) can be built with large voids tailored to trap
specific molecules, making them useful for storing gases such as
hydrogen"
