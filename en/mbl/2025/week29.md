Over the years, Texas legislators have declined to pass at least three
bills that would create siren or alert systems, a tool that Kerr
County officials tried to secure for years before the July 4 flooding."

15 News: "[2023] Ice Cube warns rap record labels encourage criminal
behavior and help fuel private prisons.. 'if you follow the money, you
go high enough, you start to see... Okay, let’s take Rap music. The
same people who own the labels own the prisons.' Ice Cube said, adding
later that there are a 'lot of dots to connect.. It's not about making
somebody write the lyrics, it's about being there as guardrails to
make sure certain songs make it through and certain songs
don’t,'.. Ice Cube then later explains that sometimes record companies
micromanage albums and that 'some records are made by committee' so
that they can push 'a narrative.' This is, according to the rapper, an
example of social engineering meant to ensure that American prisons
stay full"

In an ideal world the exchange rate would help fix imbalances (and a
Bancor system would fix it decisively), but impurities in the system
complicate matters... Many countries have dollar denominated debt,
depreciation of their currency has adverse effect on that debt, even
though depreciation would help exports. Non-diversified economies rely
on imports and exports that are "price inelastic".. And overtly
agressive financial markets can effect currencies beyond any economic
fundamentals.

Globalists likely prefer the existing system because imbalances are
fixed by placing troubled countries in debt, which makes them a slave,
fine. If a bailout is needed, they can always force politicians of the
developed world which foot the bill, sometimes on public's dime,
globalists don't care because it's not their money, they don't pay tax
anyway. If bailout cannot be arranged, still fine, they can buy public
property during an emergency fire sale. They always win.

---

That makes sense, if you are buying more than you are selling, that
reduces the demand for your currency, its price will fall which can be
inflationary. Both variables influence the exchange rate and interest
rates, with IR being the lowest in the chain, basically countries
*must* set the rate to certain values which the rest of the economy
demands. Especially for developing countries interest rates must be
set to certain levels to stabilize their exchange rate.

If a country is in a rut in terms of its exchange rates and high rates,
it must fix its current account balance.

---

CAB and pi have the highest influence, E and i have the lowest.

```python
pagerank_reversed = nx.pagerank(G.reverse())
for node, pr in sorted(pagerank_reversed.items()):
    print(f"Node {node}: {pr:.4f}")
```

```text
Node E: 0.2354
Node cab: 0.2915
Node i: 0.2116
Node pi: 0.2614
```

---

It's a jumble of relations.. A lot of variables seem to effect many
other variables. But there could be a way to solve the jumble, if we
can detect a general "outflow" of this graph from which a certain
node(s) point to other nodes more. We are looking for cascading
effects too, if A effects B which effects C, A's influence is greater
than B.

Description above sounds like PageRank but we actually need its
reverse, called CheiRank. PR is for incoming links to a node (page),
we need outgoing links (influences) from a node. We can simply reverse
graph and compute PR.

---

I believe it will look like that below

<img width='200' src='mbl/2025/argfin1.jpg'/>

---

Focusing on highly significant ones, we could create a dependency graph 

```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edges_from([
    ('i', 'E'),
    ('i', 'pi'),
    ('E', 'pi'),
    ('E', 'cab'),
    ('cab', 'pi'),
    ('cab', 'i'),
    ('pi', 'cab'),
    ('pi', 'E')
])

nx.draw(G,with_labels=True,node_size=2500)
plt.savefig('argfin1.jpg')
```

---

We could retrieve causal significance between all pairs of variables (lower is better)

```python
import statsmodels.tsa.stattools as t, itertools
vars = ['E','i','cab','pi']
gr = [(x,y,t.grangercausalitytests(df[[x,y]],maxlag=1,verbose=False)) for x,y in itertools.product(vars,vars) if x!=y]
```

```python
[(x,y,list(tmp.values())[0][0]['ssr_ftest'][1]) for x,y,tmp in gr]
```

```text
Out[1]: 
[('E', 'i', np.float64(0.0002792139878687578)),
 ('E', 'cab', np.float64(0.9979766387184925)),
 ('E', 'pi', np.float64(2.215610311531833e-09)),
 ('i', 'E', np.float64(0.28212834795173775)),
 ('i', 'cab', np.float64(1.0739219996856827e-05)),
 ('i', 'pi', np.float64(0.7974862665835333)),

 ('pi', 'cab', np.float64(2.7202463202869524e-07))]
```

---

The variables are

- Interest Rate (i)
- Inflation (pi)
- Current Account Balance (CAB)
- Exchange Rate (E)

We could look at some data.. (below).. For Argentina,

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('arg-fin.csv',index_col='date')
df[['cab','E','pi','i']].corr()
```

```text
Out[1]: 
          cab         E        pi         i
cab  1.000000  0.202825  0.124310  0.085886
E    0.202825  1.000000  0.957765  0.832089
pi   0.124310  0.957765  1.000000  0.936008
i    0.085886  0.832089  0.936008  1.000000
```

CAB and E are pretty highly correlated.. but how about causation?

to order their incineration."

These neolib pro-market dimwits truly have no other trick than this
supply-sider bullshit. The 'letting banks offer higher-risk mortgages
to borrowers' sounds too pre-2008.

Here we see the result of confining self to a smaller solution set.
They decided *not* to rebalance wealth inequality from get-go, well,
what is left to play with?

The iPaper: "[Chancellor] Reeves wants your savings on stock
market.. The Chancellor pledged to take a more pro-risk approach to
regulations in a bid to boost economic growth.. As well as announcing
laxer financial regulations, for example letting banks offer
higher-risk mortgages to borrowers on modest incomes, the Chancellor
insisted that 'it is clear that we must do more', adding: 'In too many
areas, regulation still acts as a boot on the neck of businesses,
choking off the enterprise and innovation that is the lifeblood of
growth'"

"@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social

My opinion on $1bn being defunded from US cyber defence budget and 1bn
being added added to US cyber offense budget:

People don’t even know what Netscalers they own.  That’s the reality.

Critical US gov systems aren’t patched almost a month in despite
binding orders to patch.

If US start attacking other countries, US citizens will end up dealing
with impacts of ransomware, wipers etc - defense just isn’t strong
enough."

ProPublica: "Since 2011, cloud computing companies that wanted to sell
their services to the U.S. government had to establish how they would
ensure that personnel working with federal data would have the
requisite 'access authorizations' and background
screenings. Additionally, the Defense Department requires that people
handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. This
presented an issue for Microsoft, which relies on a vast global
workforce..

Microsoft’s foreign workforce is not permitted to access sensitive
cloud systems directly, so the tech giant hired U.S.-based 'digital
escorts,' who had security clearances that authorized them to access
sensitive information, to take direction from the overseas
experts. The engineers might briefly describe the job to be completed
— for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug
or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then the escort copies
and pastes the engineer’s commands into the federal cloud.

The problem, ProPublica found, is that digital escorts don’t
necessarily have the advanced technical expertise needed to spot
problems.

'We’re trusting that what they’re doing isn’t malicious, but we really
can’t tell,' said one current escort."

SDF (Kurds in NE Syria) rebuff Syria integration. Hadn't US picked up
the SDF leader Abdi by helicopter bringing him to Damascus for a deal
back in March? What happened to that deal?

Ambassador Tom Barack (to TR), seemingly calling the shots on Syria,
talks about Syria integration, tells SDF to watch their step. Perhaps
encouraged by that HTS attacks Druze, the smaller problem, testing the
waters for the big fish (the Kurds). Then Israel responds to that with
an attack on Damascus, HTS.

TR talks Syria integration, but internally gets ready to elevate
Kurdish, Arab identity at its own state level which makes people think
they are making TR palatable for Syrian Arabs and Kurds so they can be
swallowed up one day. Former TR Kurdish seperatist leader Ocalan looks
to be on board with that.

Is TR fomenting trouble by talking integration, causing chaos, then
preparing for an easier meal later?

Some in TR label now as a "foundational moment" where a new nation is
born, ushering in more representation and democracy. But major
opposition leader is in jail, along with others who could cause
trouble.

It is also not clear how while demoting a defunct identity
(Turkishness) elevating minority groups in their place a la Lebanon
can make things better. To see the result of that we can just look to,
well, Lebanon. Will there be a Sunni party, Alevite party, Kurd party
and during election time Sunnis vote for the Sunni party, Kurds for
the Kurd party, so on, and that can promote a merit based governance?

Trump says once (on self-driving cars) "we will not allow those things
on American roads". Notice the word *American* roads, which supposedly
gives the opposition a nationalist (rightist) character. But, the car
is American, its producer is American, its software is American.  The
issue is already within national boundaries. The faux right-wing
characterization falls flat on its face.

Politico: "How the GOP Regulars Won Over Donald Trump.. Much has been

leaders still set the boundaries... Projecting American force against

signing a tax bill that nearly could have been written by the Wall
Street Journal editorial page, Trump demonstrated that the GOP still
defaults to a muscular abroad and business-friendly at home posture."

---

MAGA is in the wrong party. They try to package economic left with
nationalism (it sounds right-wing), but doesn't always work. The
ideology is internally inconsistent.

Gunn's Supes was good. This character's problem was mostly being

scenery to entice more asses on more seats, likely triggering

Levant24: Ongoing negotiations between the Syrian government and the
US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have hit a roadblock, with
officials and sources close to the talks blaming the impasse on the
SDF’s unwillingness to compromise on key issues outlined in the March
10 agreement.

Despite active mediation by US Special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack, and
the participation of European observers, including France, the latest
round of discussions concluded without major breakthroughs. According
to sources speaking to Levant 24, the government reiterated its
commitment to national unity and the integration of all local
institutions and military forces under a centralized Syrian state,
while rejecting demands for decentralization or federalism.

A One-Sided Stalemate

The SDF, continues to insist on preserving its military structure and
advancing its model of decentralized governance in northeastern
Syria. Damascus views these positions as incompatible with Syrian
sovereignty and the provisions of the agreement signed in
March between President Ahmad al-Shara and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi.

NYT: "We found that at key stages in the war, Netanyahu’s decisions
extended the fighting in Gaza longer than even Israel’s senior
military leadership deemed necessary. This was partly a result of
Netanyahu’s refusal — years before Oct. 7 — to resign when charged
with corruption, a decision that lost him the support of Israel’s
moderates and even parts of the Israeli right. In the years since his
trial, still ongoing, began in 2020, he instead built a fragile
majority in Israel’s Parliament by forging alliances with far-right
parties. It kept him in power, but it tied his fate to their extremist
positions, both before the war and after it began.

Under political pressure from those coalition allies, Netanyahu slowed
down cease-fire negotiations at crucial moments, missing windows in
which Hamas was less opposed to a deal. He avoided planning for a
postwar power transition, making it harder to direct the war toward an
endgame. He pressed ahead with the war in April and July 2024, even as
top generals told him that there was no further military advantage to
continuing. When momentum toward a cease-fire seemed to grow,
Netanyahu ascribed sudden significance to military objectives that he
previously seemed less interested in pursuing, such as the capture of
the southern city Rafah and later the occupation of the Gaza-Egypt
border. And when an extended cease-fire was finally forged in January,
he broke the truce in March in part to keep his coalition intact."

Dessler: "Texas flood was a warning about climate change... The
physics is straightforward: For every degree Celsius our planet warms,
the atmosphere holds about 7% more water vapor. When a storm occurs in
our warmed world, the air converging into the storm carries more
moisture, leading to more intense rain events. In fact, “more intense
rainfall” is one of the oldest predicted consequences of climate
change and has since been confirmed in observational datasets."
