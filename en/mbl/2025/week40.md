# Week 40

From an interview w/ \#AdamConnover. Interesting take.

Vivek Chibber: "Gore Vidal once said United States has one party with
two right wings. So basically they're two corporate parties. They
differ in that one of them, around midcentury, did experience some
sort of presence on the part of trade unions and then after the 60s
was identified with what, you today might call, social justice
movements.

But there was never a party that was rooted in the working class that
has, as part of its program, some kind of socialist or anti-capitalist
agenda. In Europe, in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, you had what we
call social democratic parties, which were historically parties that
had two aspects to them that no American parties ever had... [T]hey
were born out of the trade union movement, or they, very early on
linked themselves up to the trade union movement. That was their
identity. The second is that they had real political programs, a
political platform, that was primarily and even exclusively oriented
towards advancing working-class interests.. not corporate
interests. US has never had that.

Now there's a there's a variety of reasons where that's the
case... Part of it has to do with the fact that the US democratized
very early. So the US actually had the franchise for working-class
white men about a hundred years before any other country did. In
Europe, working-class men had to fight for their political rights. So
who's going to do that? Because the people lined up against their
political rights were the wealthy. So working class men and women had
to organize their own political parties to campaign for democratic
rights, because every single political party in the in Europe, up
until the 1900s, was a rich person's party. They weren't going to
fight for democratic rights. The United States, because the American
Revolution, got people democratic rights early, they got sucked up
into the system without having to organize their own parties. That has
a lot to do with why a "Labor Party" was never born... Every single
place where you got democracy [except US], it was through
working-class parties fighting for it...

[T]here's another reason.. the US conquered more and more of the
western regions as it grew, which means that working-class people who
were unhappy with their situation were just able to go out and get
some land for themselves, instead of having to fight for through a
union and through then a political party. [T]his was.. "the
frontier". The American frontier kept expanding [and kept unhappy
people occupied].

Then the final reason.. because of the racial mix but also the ethnic
mix it had a working class was very divided for a very long time and
because of that coming together in a party was also hard... These are
the three big reasons [why the left is especially weak in US]"

Politico: "The Trump administration has a message for the biggest
names in health care and tech: You won’t control the development of
artificial intelligence in medicine. Top officials at the Department
of Health and Human Services tell POLITICO that the administration
does not support a multi-year quasi-regulatory effort by firms
including Microsoft and OpenAI, and health systems including the Mayo
Clinic and Duke Health, to pilot private-sector-led vetting of AI
tools under the banner of the Coalition for Health AI.

'They don’t speak for us,' Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O’Neill said to
POLITICO. The coalition, he added, threatens to become a 'cartel' in
which big companies squelch startups and corner the booming market for
artificial intelligence in health care. He said he’s heard from
industry 'that if you want to work in the space, you have to be a
member, and we just want to make clear that that is not the case.'"

The New Republic: "Oracle CEO Safra Catz—who is currently leading the
acquisition of TikTok’s U.S. assets—told former Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in 2015 that they had to 'embed the love and respect for
Israel in the American culture.'"

---

Chibber, *Confronting Capitalism*: "After more than forty years of
neoliberalism, the road back to sanity is going to be a long one. And
it is by no means certain that we will achieve it. Even while free
market fundamentalism is ideologically weakened, it is still a strong
political force. For the latter to change, the Left will have to
gather up its strength at a scale we have not seen since midcentury."

---

Vivek Chibber, *The Class Matrix*: "The particular strategies chosen
by elites were situationally specific. In Britain and France, the
charge to dismantle social democratic institutions seems to have been
taken by political parties, with employers waiting to see if the
waters were safe and then diving in as labor’s weakness became
clear...

Swedish employers seemed to have been spurred to action in the late
1970s as the Social Democrats unveiled the Meidner Plan, an initiative
that proposed to gradually transfer control over capital to Swedish
unions. After mobilizing successfully to block its adoption, employers
gradually ramped up their political campaign. They led the charge to
dismantle Sweden’s famed [social] institutions, the centerpiece of
which was the sectoral peak bargaining system, and by the early 1990s
had succeeded in the endeavor...

Germany followed a similar path of employer-led
restructuring. Reunification with the East opened up a vast zone of
nonunionized labor in the newly in- corporated regions, which put
downward pressure on wages, and employers lost no time in demanding
concessions from workers in the very core of the manufacturing
sector... By the early 2000s, German unions were holding on as best
they could but were unable to hold off employers’ escalating attacks,
not just on bargaining institutions but also on the welfare state
itself..

Now, there is ample ground for debate about the specifics of each
case. But the basic fact of capitalists’ participation in the
dismantling of redistributive institutions is beyond dispute. This
reaction from employers is important because it undermines the
prediction that they might learn to accept social democracy once it is
in place owing to its growth-enhancing effects. Had they learned to
appreciate the latter, one might reasonably expect that, at least in a
substantial plurality of the cases, their reaction to labor’s weakened
state would be to step in and shore up social democratic
institutions. So, where labor’s hand was failing, they would
compensate for its reduced effectiveness. What we find, however, is a
consistent pattern in their reactions—across the board, they showed an
enduring hostility to the redistributive institutions."

TAC: "Late-night hosts on broadcast television are uniformly and
almost banally liberal. They have sacrificed much of the comedic and
entertainment value of their shows by offering bad political
commentary under the guise of monologues. Most importantly, they have
decided to appeal to at best half of an already declining audience."

The strongest power center in US is the private complex, but not all
members of that group have equal reach in all aspects of shady
operations. If you are Coca-Cola you can have a union leader
assasinated in Columbia, no problem. You have that power. If you are
in the oil/gas/energy complex, you can have a Kennedy assasinated,
that is within your reach, as long as form the right alliances, get
buddy-buddy with a few other power centers. Texas oil interests worked
with LBJ, and they had JFK assasinated.

But when the oil/gas/energy complex protested against the passage
Iran-Libya Sanction Act in 1996, they were ignored, because the
**military**-industrial complex (using AIPAC as their cover and
lobbying arm) wanted that law, it was aligned with their interests,
would indirectly create more profits for their weapon sales, increase
the specter of conflict in West Asia.

MIC is the big dog here... Even their lowly members can have you shot,
have you killed in broad daylight, like those two people who went
against Hewlett Packard and "handled", in the same day. Snap. Gone.

That is why the real shooter who assasinated Charlie Kirk is likely an
MIC operative, the only group who could have arranged something this
big and daring.

Even if the capability is there it would be too risky to rely on it
when nuclear weapons are involved. US might as well assume M.A.D.

Did DJT just say they can pinpoint the locations of Russian nuclear
weapons but US' are invisible (giving US an advantage in a
first-strike scenario)? That can warrant a little investigation. MSM,

Al-Jazeera: "Trump has issued an executive order in which the United
States pledges to guarantee Qatar’s security – including retaliatory
military action – if the country were to come under attack again, in
the wake of Israel’s unprecedented air strikes on the country last
month that drew regional and global outrage."

"@atomicpoet@atomicpoet.org

🔥 Big update: the PeerTube co-op idea is taking off.

Yesterday I shared the proposal publicly—and the response has been
outstanding. Seven people have already stepped up to become
founder-members, ready to build a member-owned, democratically
governed alternative to corporate video platforms.

What started as a loose idea is now a real plan—and credit goes to
@Crissy for pushing me to turn the idea into a proper proposal.

We’re at the early stages: talking with existing Fediverse co-ops, and
I’ve reached out to the BC Co-op Association to guide us through
incorporation. Next up: drafting bylaws, shaping governance, and
laying a solid foundation together.

Once incorporated, member-owners will decide everything—policies,
hosting practices, monetization models. This isn’t just another social
media platform. It’s a co-operative effort to build something
transparent, resilient, and ours.

If this speaks to you—if you want to help shape a new, community-owned
video platform—get in touch. This is how alternatives get built."

"For the past 15 years, F-Droid has provided a safe and secure haven
for Android users around the world to find and install free and open
source apps. When contrasted with the commercial app stores — of which
the Google Play store is the most prominent — the differences are
stark: they are hotbeds of spyware and scams, blatantly promoting apps
that prey on their users through attempts to monetize their attention
and mine their intimate information through any means necessary,
including [trickery and dark patterns](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years).

F-Droid is different. It distributes apps that have been validated to
work for the user’s interests, rather than for the interests of the
app’s distributors. The way F-Droid works is simple: when a developer
creates an app and hosts the source code publicly somewhere, the
F-Droid team reviews it, inspecting it to ensure that it is completely
open source and contains no undocumented anti-features such as
advertisements or trackers. Once it passes inspection, the F-Droid
build service compiles and packages the app to make it ready for
distribution."

"@don_atoms@hostux.social

For 15 years, F-Droid has been the antidote to Google Play: no
trackers, no ads, just open source apps. Now, Google wants to kill it.

Under the guise of 'security', Google is forcing devs to register,
pay, and surrender control. F-Droid can’t comply without betraying its
principles. Thousands of apps could vanish overnight.

Fight back: demand sideloading rights, pressure regulators/Parliament,
and defend one of the safe harbors for ethical tech."

Racially if they are tigga as in from the East they are only mildly
related to Anatolia, they can be similar to the extent they are
regionally close, same way as the Greeks are, or the Arabs. In Asia
Minor this is an assimilated race, present in the tomato soup (not
melting pot) which did not change the overall structure as much. The
official "T-word" narrative is based on a lie.

"@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Federal Emergency Management
Agency had an undisclosed CitrixBleed2 incident which lead to a
widespread incident and data theft from the USG.

24 people have been fired over the incident.

The USG really needs to have a word with Citrix over this one btw as
it’s a textbook example of a vendor prioritising its own interests
over the interests of its customers, in this case the USG.

It wasn’t the only federal government function that got
compromised. Very weird the cybersecurity response basically got
outsourced to a porg with a Windows XP avatar on Mastodon [he is
referring to himself]."

"AI Scalers", and their LLM approach already hit an upper limit of
growth, there is no more improvements to be had by simply scaling, and
the end result is still pretty stupid. Throwing more hardware at the

Unending "memes" comparing Americans to immigrants of sorts who could

Strait to get there from Asia. They did not **evolve** there, as
humans did in Africa. They left, and arrived to new lands.
