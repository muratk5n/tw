<p>TAC: "Many conservatives have declared [Mamdani] an Islamic
communist. But it’s unlikely the secular Mamdani, who enthusiastically
campaigned in gay clubs, is a jihadist. The communist accusation has
more legs, as Mamdani is a self-declared socialist, albeit a
milquetoast 'democratic' kind. The strong denunciations are driven by
the understandable desire to paint Mamdani as a dangerous force in
American politics. Calling him 'woke' or a 'radical leftist' doesn’t
seem to cut it, so conservatives want to refer to him as something
newer and more menacing...</p>
<p>Enter the 'Third Worldism' accusation. Hudson Institute fellow Zineb
Riboua argued Mamdani espouses this ideology in two Substack
posts.. The article primarily focuses on Mamdani’s opposition to
Israel rather than his socialism. It insists anti-Zionism lies at the
heart of Third Worldism. This strongly implies the purpose of
popularizing the term is to sell a new version of neoconservatism to
American right-wingers. In order to defeat woke, we must apparently
back Israel against the mullahs’ cancel culture. It’s unnecessary and
unwise to connect Israeli support with unrelated domestic matters."</p>

<p>TAC: "In a CBS News/YouGov survey released Sunday that sampled 2,124
U.S. adults interviewed October 29–31, 2025, Trump posted personal
record lows on the economy and inflation.. And though holders of
Nvidia stock may be racking in the big money, normal Americans, the
hundreds of millions who aren’t overleveraged in data centers, useless
crypto, and computer graphic chips, are struggling to hold on to what
they have. New numbers from Ritholtz wealth management show just how
wide the gap between the haves and the have nots has truly become. The
top 10 percent of US households now own 87 percent of all U.S. stocks,
with the top 1 percent alone owning 50 percent. By comparison, the
bottom 50 percent of households hold only 1 percent of all
U.S. stocks. So while Trump beats his chest about rocketing stocks,
the vast majority of Americans aren’t benefitting from 'numbers go up'
at all.</p>
<p>And then there’s the housing market. According to new figures
published by real estate brokerage firm Redfin, only 2.8 percent of
homes changed hands in the first nine months of 2025, about 28 per
1,000. That’s the lowest turnover in at least 30 years. Furthermore,
only one out of 100 homes in New York and Los Angeles turned over in
the first eight months of the year. Housing issues and the insolvency
of the middle and lower class were supposed to be the big programs of
the MAGA project, not fighting every country over antique religious
doctrines. But no worry, at some point all the good-hearted AI and
crypto billionaires will surely bail us all out"</p>

to ignore."</p>
<hr />
<p>Mondoweiss: "Take a March 2025 Pew poll as an example... [it] reveals
that more and more younger Republicans are souring on [Israel]. 50% of
GOP voters under the age of 50 expressed a negative view of Israel,
compared to just 35% in 2022. These numbers line up with a number of
recent polls, including an August 2025 University of Maryland Critical
Issues survey, which found that just 24% of Republican voters ages
18-34 sympathize more with Israelis than Palestinians. 'An Entire
Generation of Americans Is Turning on Israel,' declares a recent
Politico headline."</p>

<p>MIT Technology Review: "Goertzel was an influential figure in a fringe
community of researchers who had dreamed for years of building
humanlike artificial intelligence, an all-purpose computer program
that could do many of the things people can do (and do them better)...</p>
<p>And yet for all of LLMs’ remarkable wordplay, Goertzel doesn’t think
that they do in fact contain sparks of AGI. 'It’s a little surprising
to me that some people with a deep technical understanding of how
these tools work under the hood still think that they could become
human-level AGI,' he says...</p>
<p>We saw this when OpenAI released the much-hyped GPT-5 this summer. AI
stans were disappointed that the new version of the company’s flagship
technology wasn’t the step change they expected. But instead of seeing
that as evidence that AGI wasn’t attainable—or attainable with an LLM,
at least—believers pushed out their predictions for how soon AGI would
come. It was coming—just, you know, next time."</p>

<p>Catholicism could have seeped into the cultural fabric of America,
they have the numbers... The Irish, the Italian migration is one
factor, but most forget another huge wave of migration, the Germans,
1/3rd of whom were Catholic. And obviously the Hispanic migrants are
mostly Catholic as well. That means while growing up every American
would subconciously adapt part-Catholic cultural precepts along with
the majority Protestan ones (that includes Catholics themselves, they
will also be part-Catholic in culture, not wholly). US is a
Catholi-Protestan synthesis, not Judeo-Christian synthesis.</p>

<p>Politico: "When Jared Isaacman was the nominee for NASA chief this
spring, the billionaire entrepreneur wrote an opus proposing drastic
changes to the agency... The 62-page plan, obtained by POLITICO,
proposes outsourcing some of NASA’s missions to the private sector and
treating the government agency more like a business. The draft, known
as 'Project Athena,' not only showcases Isaacman’s radical vision for
the space agency. It comes as he reemerges as a potential candidate
for the position against acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy...</p>
<p>This has concerned some tied to NASA. It’s 'bizarre and careless,'
said one former NASA official.. Isaacman’s manifesto would radically
change NASA’s approach to science. He advocates buying science data
from commercial companies instead of putting up its own satellites,
referring to it a 'science-as-a-service.'"</p>
<hr />
<p>Cato: "At the center of the government shutdown is a disagreement over
whether to extend a temporary pandemic-era expansion of the Affordable
Care Act’s premium tax credits... [The expansion s]ubsidizes insurance
companies, not patients. Unlike other tax credits that individuals
claim on their tax returns at the end of the year, most premium tax
credits are paid in advance, directly to insurance companies, to lower
the monthly premium bill. These direct subsidies allow the insurance
industry to shift the vast majority of rising premiums onto
taxpayers. Paragon Health Institute notes that these subsidies have
been largely incorporated into insurance company profits. Since the
premium subsidies were created in the Affordable Care Act, along with
other industry-favorable spending increases, health insurer stock
prices have increased more than 1,000 percent (compared with 251
percent growth for the S&amp;P 500)."</p>

<p>Yahoo Finance: "Ray Dalio sounds alarm over looming ‘civil war’ in US
— and our power to ‘hurt each other’ has never been greater.. This
isn’t the first time Dalio has sounded the alarm about America’s
internal fractures... he wrote: 'From studying 50-plus civil wars and
revolutions, it became clear that the single most reliable leading
indicator of civil war or revolution is bankrupt government finances
combined with big wealth gaps'</p>
<p>And the U.S. is edging dangerously close to that description.</p>
<p>The national debt has climbed to $37.92 trillion, with a debt-to-GDP
ratio of 125%, up from 100% a decade ago. Dalio has warned that when
debt rises relative to income, it’s like 'plaque in the arteries' —
eventually choking off spending.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wealth inequality has ballooned. The wealthiest 1% of
Americans now hold 31% of the nation’s net worth — up from 22.8% in
1989. By contrast, the bottom 50% watched their share shrink from 3.5%

<p>I bet the rise of the gerontocracy coincides with the rise of the
uniparty. Both sides agree on the main economic system, but they need
a modicum of "battle of ideas" between two things, at least the
illusion of it, so both parties amp up culture war and superfluous
divisions, that increases polarization, then boom: Gerontocracy.</p>
<p>Vox: "[T]he median age in the US Senate is over 65 years old. In fact,
American politicians have aged so much that the United States has been
dubbed a gerontocracy — a system of government where power is
concentrated among the elderly..</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why House elections are so uncompetitive:
polarization and gerrymandering. As Americans became more polarized,
they became more loyal to their political parties. That meant that
fewer and fewer Americans split their tickets — voting for, say, a
Democratic presidential candidate while also voting for a Republican
candidate for the House or Senate — making congressional districts
safer during a general election. And more importantly, partisan
gerrymandering, where lawmakers draw up congressional districts to
benefit one party, has made competitive elections all the more rare."</p>

<p>And how accurate is it? As accurate as anything made with an LLM,
which is to say: meh, not especially, because fundamentally LLMs
aren’t built for accuracy, they’re built for statistical probability,
and these really are two separate things. Grok can find out things
