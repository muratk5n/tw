later that there are a 'lot of dots to connect.. It's not about making

make sure certain songs make it through and certain songs
don’t,'.. Ice Cube then later explains that sometimes record companies
micromanage albums and that 'some records are made by committee' so

<p>In an ideal world the exchange rate would help fix imbalances (and a
Bancor system would fix it decisively), but impurities in the system
complicate matters... Many countries have dollar denominated debt,
depreciation of their currency has adverse effect on that debt, even
though depreciation would help exports. Non-diversified economies rely
on imports and exports that are "price inelastic".. And overtly
agressive financial markets can effect currencies beyond any economic
fundamentals.</p>
<p>Globalists likely prefer the existing system because imbalances are
fixed by placing troubled countries in debt, which makes them a slave,
fine. If a bailout is needed, they can always force politicians of the
developed world which foot the bill, sometimes on public's dime,
globalists don't care because it's not their money, they don't pay tax
anyway. If bailout cannot be arranged, still fine, they can buy public
property during an emergency fire sale. They always win.</p>
<hr />
<p>That makes sense, if you are buying more than you are selling, that
reduces the demand for your currency, its price will fall which can be
inflationary. Both variables influence the exchange rate and interest
rates, with IR being the lowest in the chain, basically countries
<em>must</em> set the rate to certain values which the rest of the economy
demands. Especially for developing countries interest rates must be
set to certain levels to stabilize their exchange rate.</p>
<p>If a country is in a rut in terms of its exchange rates and high rates,
it must fix its current account balance.</p>
<hr />
<p>CAB and pi have the highest influence, E and i have the lowest.</p>

<p>It's a jumble of relations.. A lot of variables seem to effect many
other variables. But there could be a way to solve the jumble, if we
can detect a general "outflow" of this graph from which a certain
node(s) point to other nodes more. We are looking for cascading
effects too, if A effects B which effects C, A's influence is greater
than B.</p>
<p>Description above sounds like PageRank but we actually need its
reverse, called CheiRank. PR is for incoming links to a node (page),
we need outgoing links (influences) from a node. We can simply reverse

<p>ProPublica: "Since 2011, cloud computing companies that wanted to sell
their services to the U.S. government had to establish how they would
ensure that personnel working with federal data would have the
requisite 'access authorizations' and background
screenings. Additionally, the Defense Department requires that people
handling sensitive data be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. This
presented an issue for Microsoft, which relies on a vast global
workforce..</p>
<p>Microsoft’s foreign workforce is not permitted to access sensitive
cloud systems directly, so the tech giant hired U.S.-based 'digital
escorts,' who had security clearances that authorized them to access
sensitive information, to take direction from the overseas
experts. The engineers might briefly describe the job to be completed
— for instance, updating a firewall, installing an update to fix a bug
or reviewing logs to troubleshoot a problem. Then the escort copies
and pastes the engineer’s commands into the federal cloud.</p>
<p>The problem, ProPublica found, is that digital escorts don’t
necessarily have the advanced technical expertise needed to spot
problems.</p>
<p>'We’re trusting that what they’re doing isn’t malicious, but we really
can’t tell,' said one current escort."</p>

<p>SDF (Kurds in NE Syria) rebuff Syria integration. Hadn't US picked up
the SDF leader Abdi by helicopter bringing him to Damascus for a deal
back in March? What happened to that deal?</p>
<p>Ambassador Tom Barack (to TR), seemingly calling the shots on Syria,
talks about Syria integration, tells SDF to watch their step. Perhaps
encouraged by that HTS attacks Druze, the smaller problem, testing the
waters for the big fish (the Kurds). Then Israel responds to that with
an attack on Damascus, HTS.</p>
<p>TR talks Syria integration, but internally gets ready to elevate
Kurdish, Arab identity at its own state level which makes people think
they are making TR palatable for Syrian Arabs and Kurds so they can be
swallowed up one day. Former TR Kurdish seperatist leader Ocalan looks
to be on board with that.</p>
<p>Is TR fomenting trouble by talking integration, causing chaos, then
preparing for an easier meal later?</p>
<p>Some in TR label now as a "foundational moment" where a new nation is
born, ushering in more representation and democracy. But major
opposition leader is in jail, along with others who could cause
trouble.</p>
<p>It is also not clear how while demoting a defunct identity
(Turkishness) elevating minority groups in their place a la Lebanon
can make things better. To see the result of that we can just look to,
well, Lebanon. Will there be a Sunni party, Alevite party, Kurd party
and during election time Sunnis vote for the Sunni party, Kurds for
the Kurd party, so on, and that can promote a merit based governance?</p>

<p>NYT: "We found that at key stages in the war, Netanyahu’s decisions
extended the fighting in Gaza longer than even Israel’s senior
military leadership deemed necessary. This was partly a result of
Netanyahu’s refusal — years before Oct. 7 — to resign when charged
with corruption, a decision that lost him the support of Israel’s
moderates and even parts of the Israeli right. In the years since his
trial, still ongoing, began in 2020, he instead built a fragile
majority in Israel’s Parliament by forging alliances with far-right
parties. It kept him in power, but it tied his fate to their extremist
positions, both before the war and after it began.</p>
<p>Under political pressure from those coalition allies, Netanyahu slowed
down cease-fire negotiations at crucial moments, missing windows in
which Hamas was less opposed to a deal. He avoided planning for a
postwar power transition, making it harder to direct the war toward an
endgame. He pressed ahead with the war in April and July 2024, even as
top generals told him that there was no further military advantage to
continuing. When momentum toward a cease-fire seemed to grow,
Netanyahu ascribed sudden significance to military objectives that he
previously seemed less interested in pursuing, such as the capture of
the southern city Rafah and later the occupation of the Gaza-Egypt
border. And when an extended cease-fire was finally forged in January,
he broke the truce in March in part to keep his coalition intact."</p>

moisture, leading to more intense rain events. In fact, “more intense

<p>United Nations: "This report investigates the corporate machinery
sustaining Israel’s settler-colonial project of displacement and
replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory. While
political leaders and governments shirk their obligations, far too
many corporate entities have profited from Israel’s economy of illegal
occupation, apartheid and now, genocide. The complicity exposed by
this report is just the tip of the iceberg; ending it will not happen
without holding the private sector accountable, including its
executives."</p>
