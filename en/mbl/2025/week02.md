\#FediPunk is the digital gutterpunk ethos where the Fediverse thrives
in its glorious mess, held together by duct tape, user patches & sheer
spite for corporate monoculture. It's not just a rejection of
surveillance capitalism, it's a hymn to chaos, a love letter to an
internet that bleeds authenticity through its flaws.

Here, nostalgia isn't naive. It's weaponized. It remembers the wild
promise of the early web: decentralized, anarchic & gloriously
inefficient"

Assad is gone, if the new regime acts in bizarre ways that is still
fine for the complex because it will be a reason tor invade Syria, for
real this time. "Assad must go" will turn into "we need to fight
Islamic extremism", and munee will flow in the direction of the usual
suspects.

H2 Central: "Hydrogen Finally Gets A Price Tag: S&P 500 New Energy
Plays Soar Along With This Amazon Vendor – $3 per kilogram.. A number
of new energy stocks, including S&P 500 nuclear stocks Constellation
Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST), along with Amazon.com (AMZN) supplier
Plug Power (PLUG), moved higher following the Treasury Department and
Internal Revenue Service revising its rules for hydrogen production
tax credits.

The U.S. Treasury on Friday published its final rules on clean
hydrogen production, with guidelines producers must meet to qualify
for the clean hydrogen production tax credit of up to $3 per
kilogram. The move broadly gave companies clarification on whether
they could take advantage of the tax credit"

Statham got the zeitgeist immediately.. he now plays working class

Germany-based \#SovereignTechFund contributes 384.000 EUR to
\#OpenStreetMap over two years. And the best part: it's not for fancy
features big sponsors think they need, but for technical debt removal,
documentation, testing infrastructure, vandalism prevention, and two
additional paid roles.

@sovtechfund once again made a great choice and continues to follow
their strategy of sustainable support of critical \#OpenSource
projects, which @openstreetmap definitely is"

Reddit: "The Amiga was way ahead of its time graphically. How long did
it maintain this lead?.. the 3D approach used by Doom was only really
efficient with VGA's framebuffer of 'chunky' pixels, rather than the
Amiga's 'bitplane' approach. That was the tipping point at which PC
graphics became more competitive"

---

Amiga and PC.. I've had both hardware, former was seen as the king of
graphics, but all of a sudden PC platforms had a killer game, Doom.
Surprisingly to some PCs ran that graphics code extremely well.

Firstpost: "Relations between Netanyahu and Trump have hit a snag
after the Republican leader shared a video on his social media
platform TruthSocial featuring economist Jeffrey Sachs accusing
Netanyahu of manipulating the US foreign policy and orchestrating an
'endless war' in Gaza and the Middle East.

In the clip, Trump can be heard calling Netanyahu a 'deep, dark son of
a bitch'. The video came at a crucial time when intensive diplomatic
efforts are underway by Egypt, Qatar and the current US administration
to broker a truce deal between Israel and Hamas that would include
hostage releases"

"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.

Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"

The dynamics works like this: income inequality will cause bigger
income inequality, it is a self-reinforcing process. Top 1% has more
assets than bottom 99%, rent payments, grocery payments, payments of
all kinds will flow to the rich, simply because they own assets and
the rest needs those assets to live. If imbalances are not corrected
via taxation, the rich will use those payments to *increase* their
assets which means they will receive even more payments from the
bottom. Hence the cycle, the "doom-loop" keeps going.

I agree.. and it's great to be able to have this conversation

"@stux@mstdn.social

It's not okay to force other instance admins to block everything you
also block (as admin or user)

The point of the Fediverse is to have a lot of different instances
with each their own guidelines

Ofc we need to be on the same line but that doesn't mean everything
has to be 1-to-1

Personally I don't agree with: "I'll block you if you don't block what
I block'

Stop that"

Clooney got that "enterpreneurial spirit" too doesn't he, see video
below, typical all-blue capitalist Democrat, they say nothing about
inequality, complain about trans bathrooms, and otherwise rake it in
and expect their side to win elections all the time... This guy has
been an example for others, and the next gen to follow.. The smart
one... No wonder US is screwed.

It's not a problem of Reps/Dems bickering all the time.. The problem
is precisely the opposite, these fuckers are exactly the same, on
material issues that count the most, they bicker on social issues as a
cover for them allowing the economy being looted by the corporations
and the rich.

---

Remember Clooney in his more active, visible days, when he was
'splaining' all day what was wrong with politics.. He was repeating
that bullshit argument "Democrats and Republicans need to come
together". That's all he had.  Then bunch of other Holywood types
repeated this empty mantra, I guess they judged him as "the smart one"
(for what reason, noone knows), and followed him. I'm glad the
politics-savy Clooney figure finally imploded.

That should teach you to stay away from politics Holywood

Hydrogen fuel cells present a compelling alternative to lithium-ion
batteries. Hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth, making it a
virtually limitless resource. Fuel cells are also ten times lighter
than lithium-ion batteries, reducing vehicle weight and associated
infrastructure wear and tear.

Hydrogen-powered vehicles refuel in just five minutes or so, compared
to EVs taking 45-minutes to hours. Further, the hydrogen fuel cell has
an average lifespan of 20 years and offer longer driving ranges per
refill compared to EVs. With advancements in technology, blue and
green hydrogen production costs are becoming increasingly competitive"

Autoencoders are not unsupervised either IMO, again the same idea, the
data itself becomes label. You are still using an architecture that
requires labels.

NYT: "Ireland Joins South Africa’s Genocide Case Against Israel"

---

Notice how Israel's response to anything untoward to itself is
immediate violence. They know their protector in US very well.. Every
rocket, every bomb represents an increase in the margin of the private
complex, surface state, greedy mob of muppets who make money from
mayhem in the middle east.

---

It's more like they want to protect Israel as the weapon-purchaser-in-chief
in its unending fight with its neighbors.. Israel is good business. Munee
needs to flow in their direction, lots of people eat from it.

Forward: "The Heritage Foundation plans to 'identify and target'
volunteer editors on Wikipedia who it says are 'abusing their
position' by publishing content the group believes to be antisemitic,
according to documents obtained by the Forward."

Happy Past January 6. Insurrectionists: be better prepared next time.

Obviously serious researchers seeking alternatives means human level
AI will not be reached via existing approaches. They are just wasting
energy, creating bunch of junk.

---

I would call the empty-patch approach supervised learning, it
seemingly does not require labels, but the labels are generated from
the data itself. Clustering, PCA are unsupervised, at a fundamental
level. 

---

New "AI" idea is working on a layered architecture where vision based
training starts first, a net is trained by taking out patches from
real-world images, and machinery tries to predict those empty
patches. That way the necessary internal connections are formed
representing the outside world, visually, then other learning is
layered on top...

Will motor function be part of that training? A big part of how we
learn the world is tied to how we move in it. When I take a big step
vs small one, I see certain visual changes in the outside world (far
points move little, near ones a lot), that is part of my understanding
of the outside world.

As easy sources of oil become depleted, more risky, harder to drill

Actually I was unfair, LLMs are not as smart as an hamster.. An
hamster is still smarter than these "AI" algorithms. I meant LLM
*processing power* is similar to an hamster. But since their
algorithms are shit, inefficient, the result is colorful, sometimes
creative, parroty junk. It can sound smart, but boy, when it takes a
wrong turn, it all goes down the cliff.. A hamster is absolutely
smarter than any neural network based approach currently in use.
