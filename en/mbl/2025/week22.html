<p>Sussex Bylines: "Why has Sangita Myska (LBC) not been on the air since
interviewing Israeli Government spokesman, Avi Hyman, in April?..</p>
<p>In the UK, we celebrate having a free press. News that is fettered to
a particular view point is more accurately considered
propaganda... Most readers would be horrified to think that our news
outlets are censored if they stray from a particular line, especially
if the line to be taken is dictated by a foreign state.</p>
<p>In the middle of April, Myska interviewed.. Hyman. Many news sources
had reported that Israel had attacked Iran’s consulate in Syria and,
two weeks later, that Iran had launched 200 drones and missiles at
Israel in retaliation.</p>
<p>Myska referred to the convention that consulates and embassies are
considered sovereign territories of their Government, and asked Hyman
whether Israel’s actions had therefore escalated an already fragile
situation. Hyman took issue with the question, specifically Myska’s
use of the term consulate, despite her simply referring to what had
been reported widely elsewhere. Following that interview, Myska has
not been on air..</p>

<p>The EU is Israel's biggest market, but is now moving to suspend its

agreement (article 2).  The suspension requires the support of 15 out
of 27 states (which it already has) but also the support of states
representing 65% of the EU population. This means one at least of
Germany or Italy has to move to support it.</p>

thing. 'This is not my war,' stated President Donald Trump
emphatically to a dubious —nay, hostile— White House Press Corps when
asked about the potential outcome of negotiations with Russia over
ending the Ukraine War... the president was essentially acknowledging
that he had no real leverage over Russia to get them to end the
war. So, rather than needlessly drag out this hopeless conflict (for
the NATO side of the proxy war with Russia), where 5,000 young men die
every week, Trump is readying to cut his, and America’s, losses"</p>

<p>.. and of course if too many (wealthy) people buy REITs, or mREITs
they would be contributing to rising housing prices. This is how
median home now costs nearly half a f**ing million dollars. The
uber-wealthy did that to you America. Know thy enemy.</p>

stock, you buy shares of a REIT ETF that buys those stocks. There are
trillions in REIT and related instruments.</p>

<p>"A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing
real estate REITs enable [investors] to benefit from owning shares in
valuable real estate, and having access to dividend-based income and
total returns... mREITs (or mortgage REITs) don’t own real estate
directly, instead they finance real estate and earn income from the
interest on these investments"</p>

<hr />
<p>Galloway: "The 0.1% have insulated themselves from the general public
with their own schools, health care, transportation, security, and
justice system. The members of this rarefied class are unfazed by the
chaos unfolding outside their gated properties... They’re invested in
hedge funds and fine art, not in the future of America. With the means
to hire shrewd defense attorneys and aggressive PR firms that
weaponize social media bots, the superrich are protected by the law,
but not bound by it. The lower 99% are bound by the law, but not
protected by it.</p>
<p>Living in their bubble, the extremely rich express shock and horror,
but opt not to rock the $300 million boat... With vast wealth comes
enormous influence. Money is a proxy for power. The top 0.1% have more
than five times as much wealth as the bottom 50%. Just 100 billionaire
families invested a record 2.6 billion in federal elections last year,
1 of every 6 dollars spent overall. These wealthy individuals could
galvanize politicians and push back against policies that undermine
American values, but they’re largely quiet...</p>
<p>In his first 100 days as president in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt
moved swiftly to lift the country out of the Great Depression,
building the foundation for his New Deal. As historians have observed,
he had another objective: to prove democracy works. But the
president’s programs sparked criticism from rich Americans, who
regarded him as a traitor to his class. A powerful group, including
the DuPonts, the founders of General Motors, and assorted oil
millionaires, launched the American Liberty League to fight back.</p>
<p>Today we again need some bold class traitors to address America’s
worsening inequalities"</p>

<p>Mfkers might patch that now (its maintainers can add a system prompt
so LLM reverts to an actual hand-coded counter algorithm), but the
fact that it could not now, could not reach to that point with its own
training, points to fundemantal deficiencies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just tested an LLM with a letter count task (e.g. count how many 'a'
letters in some word). It failed miserably. The tech which supposedly
already surpassed human intelligence, nearing "singularity", cannot
count letters in a word.</p>
