"Why build with concrete when you can build with stone?.. Creating a
concrete structure involves extracting limestone from a quarry,
heating it to 1,450°C in a kiln and then grinding the residue to a
powder to make cement. This cement is mixed with aggregates and water
and poured into shuttering, which workers have spent hours
painstakingly putting together along with rebar to give the structure
its tensile strength. Once set, the shuttering is removed and, 28 days
later, the concrete will have reached its full strength.

Why not cut out all this faff simply by using quarried limestone
blocks to create the structure? After all, that is what people did for
thousands of years before cement was invented. And stone is typically
two and half times stronger, with a carbon footprint one third that of
concrete."

There’s a myth in the US that the only way to enact change is to elect
sympathetic politicians and hope they do the right thing. But history
shows that the most effective way to get politicians to act is to
disrupt economic activity. Strikes, boycotts, sabotage, and other
organized disruptions have overwhelmingly been the primary catalysts
behind every major legislative action that has benefited the public."

Arnold the politician shows up in the disaster movie *2012*. In that
case it was more coastal liberal sniping than anything else whose
worries are mostly cosmetic, around properness and the like, not truly
economics. Remember the movie there is a point when its truly disaster
part begins, and the seque into that is the governator saying "it
seems to me, the worst is ovaaah". 

---

The writers claim the dollar bill thing was a President Schwarzenegger
joke also made in other movies but I think they are being sly. Arnold
the politician was made to look like he was part of the system, which
in *Running Man* is an overly capitalistic one. The governator's
politics is in line with that, I can see why they used his image, at
the same time, indirectly giving a nod to the '87 movie.

The final calculation, a ratio between near and far counts.. The ratio
can be calculated statistically, we get a distribution for the ratio
and can check if it is centered around 1. Below

```python
u.get_ufo().poisson_ratio(*params)
```

```text                                                                                
            ess_tail  r_hat  
alpha        778.682  1.012  
beta        5749.046  1.001  
sigma_year   797.879  1.011  
rate_ratio  5749.046  1.001  
P(rate_ratio > 1) = 0.531
Median rate ratio: 1.0019251945798229
Mean rate ratio: 1.00257020377643
95% HDI: [0.95493458 1.05285043]
P(rate_ratio > 1): 0.531125
P(0.9 <= rr <= 1.1): 0.99975
```

It is centered around 1.. The non-nuke sighting counts are
indistinquishable from the nuke site sightings.. 

---


---

The counts, after proper scaling

```python
params = u.get_ufo().ufo_sighting_nuke_counts()

pd.DataFrame(params).T.tail(7)
```

```text
Out[1]: 
       0    1    2
77  2004  224  234
78  2005  201  231
79  2006  179  209
80  2007  243  247
81  2008  231  284
82  2009  222  255
83  2010  167  147
```

UFO activity near nuclear areas.. 🤔 I already have data for UFO
sightings.. and geo locations of "nuke sites". Could compare sighting
counts within 100 km radius of those sites vs the rest.. It's just a
GLM via Poisson distribution on annual basis

IC: "One way Zohran Mamdani could arrest Indicted War Criminal
Benjamin Netanyahu.. When ICC enforcement is blocked, international
law provides an alternative mechanism: universal jurisdiction. This
principle allows any state to prosecute individuals accused of grave
international crimes—such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against
humanity—regardless of where the crimes occurred or the nationality of
the perpetrator. Several countries, including Switzerland, Portugal,
Spain, France and Germany, have successfully used universal
jurisdiction to prosecute foreign officials, such as the conviction of
former Gambian Interior Minister Ousman Sonko for crimes against
humanity in 2024.. Israel justified Eichmann’s abduction from
Argentina by invoking universal jurisdiction..

If we analogise Eichmann’s arrest to the potential arrest of Netanyahu
by New York authorities, numerous similarities emerge. The application
of universal jurisdiction to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu upon his entry
into New York does not require Israel or the United States to be State
members to the ICC; it suffices that the perpetrators committed
heinous crimes that affect the international community as a whole and
threat international peace and security—a condition that applies to
Netanyahu...

Some may argue that NYPD lack the legal authority to arrest Benjamin
Netanyahu.. It is believed that exercising universal jurisdiction does
not require prior authorization, as it derives its legitimacy from
customary international law, which regards norms combating grave
crimes such as war crimes and crimes against humanity as peremptory
norms (*Jus cogens*) that cannot be overridden or violated."

TAC: "The publication of the Trump administration’s National Security
Strategy (NSS) has, predictably, ignited a firestorm through the
corridors of power in Kiev and European capitals, while Moscow
welcomed it. The document’s stark language, declaring an urgent
priority to end the war in Ukraine, has been met with a mixture of
outrage and denial from transatlantic elites. What these reactions
reveal is a fundamental clash between entrenched transatlantic
idealism and a resurgent American realism."

Blaming Biden will not work anymore, it's been almost a year into the

responsibility.

WH must have finally settled on a messaging.. If WH accepted

negativity, right? So now the spin is to deny that it exists and hope
things turn around for the better.

"China was once at the start of the Silk Road, but now, it is at the
start of the Hydrogen Road. For the first time, China’s new corridor
will be transporting hydrogen across provinces through a dedicated
pipeline. China is shifting to more renewable energy, which will give
it the ability to operate on clean energy...

Beijing is now able to capture the green hydrogen produced in Inner
Mongolia, which is one of the best locations in the country for green
hydrogen.. the pipeline is expected to start functioning at almost
100,000 tons of hydrogen output in a year. Nonetheless, the pipeline
has been designed with the ambition of attaining considerable
operational scalability... With additional renewable-powered
electrolyzers coming online in Inner Mongolia, the completion of the
compression facilities, and the storage facilities along the route,
the corridor will eventually be able to accommodate 500,000 tons a
year."

How about Armenians? Both Greeks and Armenians were present in big
numbers before WWI in Asia Minor. I'd say the Greeks, concentrated on
the West, would be more influential, Armenians had the numbers too
(before the bad events), just somewhat out of the mainstream. Armenian
version is a variation of the Orthodoxy Church, theirs is more distant
to Catholicism than Greek Orthodox is, concentrated in the East.

---

Culture requires proximity, transmitted via society through osmosis,
spanning many centuries, in that case which religion would Anatolians
be close to, culturally, other than Islam? The Catholic Church? The
Orthodox Church?

Both, and the two sects are similar to each other anyway. One college
mate (American of Irish descent, Catholic) told a Greek friend
(Orthodox) once that "our stuff is basically the same but your guys
have funnier hats". The observation is correct. And I, as Anatolian,
would have the cultural precepts from both. Asia Minor is from the
area deeply intertwined with Christian history after all.

US Venezuella deployment might partly be a response to Russian Cuban
deployment.. But then this has already gone too far, a response to a
response to a Western fuckup...? Just like back in the 60s, the
solution can be the same. All countries need to mind their business
and respect RU's security concerns.

"Kennedy's courageous handling of the crisis".. Smokescreen. He
climbed down from his position on the missile deployment in Russia's
backyard. The removal would be done in a later date, so many did not
notice this detail, but it happened nevertheless. The delay was there
to help Kennedy save face.

---

Increased Russian presence in the Caribbean was likely a tit-for-tat
response to US support for Ukraine... Just like back in the 60s it
took potential Soviet missile deployment on Cuba to make US pull its
head out of the sand and finally decide to remove its own missiles
from Anatolia, the recent Cuba play can hopefully trigger the same
response.
