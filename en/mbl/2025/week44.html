<p>Pettis, <em>Trade Wars are Class Wars</em>, 2020: "There is no guaranteed way
to identify the origin of an imbalance, but market prices can provide
clues.. The current account deficit country is..  the likely source of
the imbalance if its interest rates rise (or the international value
of its assets goes down) as its external financing need rises. This is
a frequent phenomenon for countries on the periphery of the
international financial system.</p>
<p>Consider Turkey over the past few years. Between 2010 and 2018, the
country went on an investment binge funded by borrowing from
abroad. Turkey’s current account deficit was consistently worth about
6 percent of its domestic income. This boosted output at the cost of
rising debt.  Attracting foreign money to cover this excess of
spending over income required persistent currency depreciation beyond
what would have been implied by differences in inflation: the real
value of the Turkish lira fell by half between 2010 and the middle of
2018. Unsurprisingly, foreign savers grew increasingly skeptical of
Turkey and mostly lent in debt that could only be repaid with
U.S. dollars, not Turkish lira. (Think of Argentina’s
nineteenth-century gold-backed debts.)</p>
<p>Interest rates also had to rise. The cost of a dollar-denominated
business loan rose from about 4 percent in 2010 to 6 percent by the
second half of 2018. Over the same period, interest rates on
lira-denominated ​business loans soared from 9 percent to 28
percent. Eventually, foreign revulsion with Turkish assets slashed
Turkish spending power, which in turn forced Turks to cut their
consumption and investment to the point that they moved into a current
account surplus by the middle of 2019."</p>

<p>Based on Masse's previous expertise I am not surprised a
groundbreaking theory came from him. RM expertise is seismology, this
is one of the most demanding, exacting areas in science while being
100% grounded in mechanics. Under the earth's crust there are massive
forces at play, there is constant pull and push, there are <em>waves</em>
that travel... If you can work with those you can basically work on
anything else in theoretical physics. The first time I got a glimpse
of their domain was while looking for ways to code a certain
computational method, the top guys on it were from seismology, and I
saw some of the other work they do, it was hard core. They have the
right mix of theory, computation, and experimental domain that leaves
no room for bullshittery. Theoretical physics as profession is full of
wankers, they are paid to dream up stupid ideas, as a result, that is
exactly what they produce.</p>

<p>It is true after 2003 German savings rate increased</p>
<p><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS?locations=DE">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Pettis: "The most straightforward effect of the [2003 Labor "reform"]
law has been a steady rise in the poverty rate, particularly for
Germans who have jobs. In 2005, when the data begin, only 5 percent of
German workers were at risk of poverty. By 2015 that proportion had
doubled to 10 percent. This was driven by a shift to low-paying
part-time work..</p>
<p>Germany’s precrisis current account surplus—and the corresponding
deficit in the rest of the world—was recycled abroad by Germany’s
banks.  Of the country’s cumulative €2.7 trillion in financial
outflows, a little more than €1.6 trillion can be attributed to banks
in Germany buying bonds and making loans abroad... Massive lending
abroad was the only way the banks could reconcile weak German demand
for credit and heightened German saving."</p>
<hr />
<p>Pettis: "Before 2012, .. Germans consumed less than they produced, and
they underinvested in their country, which produced large surpluses
with the rest of the world. At the same time, Spaniards, Greeks, and
the others experienced booms, spending far more than they earned and
borrowing to cover the differences. In the years leading up to the
global financial crisis, Spain had the second-biggest trade deficit in
the world, behind only the United States, while Greece, a country of
just eleven million people, had the fifth biggest. But Germany’s
pathologies—rising inequality, depressed consumption, and systematic
underinvestment—were a preview of what was to come for the rest of the
continent...</p>
<p>The European crisis.. was about income distribution. German policies
developed in response to the twin shocks of reunification and the
postcommunist liberation of Eastern Europe transferred purchasing
power from workers and retirees to the ultrarich, which in turn forced
Germany’s neighbors to tolerate some combination of rising
unemployment and soaring indebtedness. The sad result was that
Germany’s leaders undermined what should have been one of the most
positive transformations of modern times: the creation of a healthy,
unified Europe."</p>
<hr />
<p>Pettis' analysis is sound. But we also need to pay attn to the
timeline, and the chicken-egg aspect of the issue in case of
China... In the beginning if the Chinese state did not turn a blind
eye to low wages and not supressed dissent, foreign companies would
not build factories there which they needed for knowledge
transfer. But later, once they had enough knowledge transfer, good
infrastructure, and capabilities of their own should they have stopped
the practice? The answer is, according to Pettis' logic,
yes. Persistent trade imbalances is not a good thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pettis, <em>Trade Wars are Class Wars</em>: "[T]here is a conflict between
economic classes <em>within</em> China that has spilled over into the United
States. Systematic transfers of wealth from Chinese workers to Chinese
elites distort the Chinese economy by strangling purchasing power and
subsidizing production at the expense of consumption. That, in turn,
distorts the global economy by creating gluts of manufactured goods
and by bidding up the prices of stocks, bonds, and real
estate. Chinese underconsumption destroys jobs elsewhere, while
inflated asset values lead to devastating cycles of booms, busts, and
debt crises...</p>
<p>China’s policies do not just hurt Americans—they also harm ordinary
Chinese workers and retirees. Chinese workers are underpaid relative
to the value of what they produce, and they are taxed too much. They
are unable to access the goods and services they ought to be able to
afford. They breathe dirty air and drink polluted water because many
local government officials place the financial interests of
politically connected business owners above the well-being of the
public."</p>
<hr />
<p>#Werleman #Israel</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PBNSwsw1cec?t=145">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Pettis: "The new [1996] rule, which came to be known as
“check-the-box” by practitioners, was supposed to make things simpler
for tax filers and make life easier for Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
examiners. Instead, it opened up massive loopholes in the corporate
tax code.  Among other things, income from royalties and licenses
could now be treated the same as income from foreign factories. The
IRS quickly recognized some of the implications and proposed a new
rule to prevent arrangements “contrary to the policies and rules of
subpart F,” but political interference blocked any fix. Once subpart F
had been neutered, the creatives in law and accounting departments all
across America began to exploit the new potential of 'intangibility.'
Unlike factories or office buildings filled with workers, patents and
other intellectual property occupy no physical space. They can be
moved anywhere in the world by filling out a few forms...</p>
<p>The simple version of the scheme is to set up a subsidiary in a
corporate tax haven and then sell the subsidiary the right to license
the patents to the rest of the company. The parent company gets a
regular payment from the subsidiary holding the patents, often quoted
as a share of total research and development (R&amp;D) costs, and the
subsidiary gets a large cut of the corporation’s global
sales. Calibrate the deal correctly and profits can be shifted from
places where taxes are high to places where taxes are low."</p>
<hr />
<p>Michael Pettis, <em>Trade Wars are Class Wars</em>: "Although [tight, global]
economic linkages have many benefits, they can also transmit problems
from one society to another. People in one country are often
responsible for unaffordable housing, debt crises, job losses, and
pollution elsewhere. The Chinese government.. offers cheap bank loans
to real estate developers, and American manufacturing workers lose
their jobs. German companies slash wages as the German government cuts
welfare spending, and Spaniards get a housing bubble.</p>
<p>The thesis of this book is that rising inequality within countries
heightens trade conflicts between them. This is ultimately an
optimistic argument: we do not believe that the world is destined to
endure a zero-sum conflict between nations or economic blocs... The
problems of the past few decades do not have their roots in
geopolitical conflict or incompatible national characters. Rather,
they have been caused by massive transfers of income to the rich and
the companies they control."</p>

while delivering up to hundreds or even thousands of times higher
computational efficiency and energy performance than today’s leading
