# Week 37

Monbiot: "I seem to recall the country voting the Tories out last
year. Part of the reason.. was their staggering incompetence and
insouciance, epitomised by Liz Truss’s mini-budget. That catastrophe
was, like Truss’s political career, formed and steered by the
neoliberal junktanks of Tufton Street... We booted them out through
the front door.. Yet they still appear to be in the house. Perhaps
they came round the back..

After taking an interest in the Department for Business and Trade’s
'growth school' speaker sessions for civil servants, I sent a freedom
of information request.. Among the external instructors used by the
department’s 'growth school' so far are no representatives from trade
unions, social justice, human rights or environmental groups, and no
representatives from left or liberal thinktanks such as the New
Economics Foundation or the Institute for Public Policy Research. But
there are four who work or have worked for the Tufton Street junktanks
that surrounded Truss."

The Lever: "The Secret Curriculum That Rewired America’s Judges.. For
decades, big business-funded economics courses have been pushing the
nation’s judges to the right. A new study in the Quaterly Journal of
Economics reveals nearly half of U.S. federal judges attended crash
courses in economics at the conservative-leaning Manne Economics
Institute for Federal Judges between 1976-1999 - and it changed how
they behaved on the bench"

The Guardian: "More children around the world are obese than
underweight for the first time, according to a UN report that warns
ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets.There are
188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10
– Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of
life-threatening diseases."

"@notjustbikes@notjustbikes.com

I've been following this 'mutual safety standards recognition'
stuff... This could be really, really bad. It would mean that US
vehicles, like those giant dangerous SUVs and pickup trucks, could be
freely imported into the EU in volume without having to pass EU
vehicle safety standards (like pedestrian safety)."

Joint Statement on transatlantic trade and investment that says, with

"When you store your knowledge and skills as parametric curves (as all
deep learning models [like LLMs] do), the only way you can generalize
is via interpolation on the curve. The problem is that interpolated
points *correlate* with the truth but have no *causal* link to the
truth. Hence hallucinations.

The fix is to start leveraging causal symbolic graphs as your
representation substrate (e.g. computer programs of the kind we write
as software engineers). The human-written software stack, with its
extremely high degree of reliability despite its massive complexity,
is proof of existence of exact truthiness propagation.

'Does a causal substrate necessarily need to be symbolic?' you
ask. Could it be based on parametric curves?

Yes it does, because in such a substrate the model is isomorphic to
the graph of causal factors of what you are modeling. And such a graph
is necessarily very sparse, i.e. it's a symbolic graph. It has
completely different properties from a continuous manifold...

Worth noting that the output artifacts of science -- the models it
produces -- are symbolic in nature. Most commonly expressed in
mathematical form, sometimes in code.

Science is a program synthesis process."

(My first thought on seeing that chart is that I hope it represents
the peak of inflated expectations leading into the trough of
dissillusionment in the Gartner Hype Cycle, since that means we might
be reaching the end of the initial hype phase and heading towards the
slope of enlightenment.)"

Politico: "[2023] With Apple’s iPhone 15, the EU wins the charger
war.. According to leaks ahead of the reveal, the iPhones are
expected to use Apple's first new charging technology in more than a
decade: They will feature a USB-C charging port, instead of Apple's
proprietary Lightning solution."

---

"One of the driving forces behind the USB-C mandate is the EU's quest
for sustainability and a circular economy. By EU estimates,
eliminating proprietary chargers reduces e-waste by approximately
11,000 metric tons annually."

---

If it wasnt for the EU *regulation*, there would not be widespread
USB-C adoption... Merchantile, ultra capitalist muckmuckers would have
slaved people to their bizarre methods that only worked for them.

The private complex, surface state is pushing these people out in

suffer en masse, **again**. Stop what you are doing right f-ing now.

TAC: "In China, as the assembled leaders of more than 20 nations
waited in the hall for the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization to begin.. Modi and.. Putin walked in holding hands. They
approached China’s President Xi Jinping and formed a tight, intimate
circle. The leaders talked and laughed as Modi joined hands with
Xi. For a Trump administration bent on driving wedges between these
leaders, this scene, more than any words that came out of the SCO
summit, was a shocking blow."

Informed Comment: "One year ago, the UN General Assembly demanded that
Israel must end its occupation of the Palestinian Territories within
twelve months... The General Assembly voted, by 124 votes to 14.. that
not only 'demanded' an end to the occupation within a year, but called
on all countries to refrain from trade involving Israeli settlements..

A year later, Israel has failed to comply with any of the demands of
the 124 states...most of the 124 countries that voted to demand an end
to the occupation have done very little to enforce those demands. If
they fail to enforce them now, they will only confirm Israel’s
presumption that its corrupt influence on U.S. politics still ensures
blanket impunity for systematic war crimes."

Wired: "After the Democrats lost in November, they faced a
reckoning. It was clear that the party had failed to successfully
navigate the new media landscape...  Now, Democrats hope that the
secretive Chorus Creator Incubator Program, funded by a powerful
liberal dark money group called The Sixteen Thirty Fund, might tip the
scales. The program kicked off last month, and creators involved were
told by Chorus that over 90 influencers were set to take
part. Creators told WIRED that the contract stipulated they’d be
kicked out and essentially cut off financially if they even so much as
acknowledged that they were part of the program. Some creators also
raised concerns about a slew of restrictive clauses in the
contract.. Influencers included in communication about the program,
and in some cases an onboarding session for those receiving payments
from The Sixteen Thirty Fund, include Olivia Julianna.. Loren
Piretra.. Barrett Adair.. David Pakman.. Leigh McGowan, and dozens of
others"

Free, Open Source, Community Driven

The Verge: "Wikipedia is the largest compendium of human knowledge
ever assembled, with more than 7 million articles in its English
version, the largest and most developed of 343 language
projects. Started nearly 25 years ago, the site was long mocked as a
byword for the unreliability of information on the internet, yet today
it is, without exaggeration, the digital world’s factual
foundation. It’s what Google puts at the top of search results
otherwise awash in ads and spam, what social platforms cite when they
deign to correct conspiracy theories, and what AI companies scrape in
their ongoing quest to get their models to stop regurgitating
info-slurry — and consult with such frequency that they are straining
the encyclopedia’s servers. Each day, it’s where approximately 70
million people turn for reliable information on everything from
particle physics to rare Scottish sheep to the Erfurt latrine disaster
of 1184, a testament both to Wikipedia’s success and to the total
degradation of the rest of the internet as an information resource."

Politico: "A memo obtained.. cautioned Democrats about relying solely
on the emergent school of thought [Abundance], which criticizes overly
bureaucratic regulations for slowing progress on housing production
needed to drive down costs and infrastructure projects...

Progressives, led by Rep. Greg Casar.. argu[ed] that the party must
rebuild its relationship with working-class voters by vilifying
billionaires and corporate power. That's more in line with what the
memo argued will reach voters, as 'majorities of Democrats and
independents and two in five Republicans believe the outsized power of
billionaires and corporations in our government is a bigger problem
than red tape and bureaucracy'...

It described affordability as voters' primary concern, and posited
they 'see Abundance-style policy solutions as less responsive' to that
problem."
