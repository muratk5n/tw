NYT: "Israel’s leaders have articulated various goals for the
expanding war in Gaza, spreading confusion over how the objectives
might be achieved and on what terms the renewed campaign might end...

But as the military attacks areas of Gaza that it had already
conquered multiple times before, as well as some new ones, questions
remain about what the forces can do this time that they couldn’t do in
more than 15 months of fighting"

Why make a deal w/ America? Say you were Iran, one admin makes nuke
deal, the other scraps it, then wants nuke deal while threatening to
rain down nukes on them. 🤨

WSJ writes M. Adelson introduced family of hostages to Trump, they
told some stories that led Trump break his own deal, demand release of

Zucman, *The Triumph of Injustice*:"1980—2018: The Working Class Shut
Off From Economic Growth.. The picture for the period from 1980 to
2018 looks completely different [from previous era]. First, average
growth slowed down. The first characteristic of the Reagan and
post-Reagan US economy is poor growth performance...  if we look at a
[long] period —one that averages booms and busts, recessions and the
recoveries that follow—things do not look good. Since 1980, national
income per adult has grown only 1.4% on average per year. And since
the turn of the twenty-first century, it’s grown by even less than
that: 0.8% a year"

---

The word "voodoo economics" is not my invention. George Bush Sr. used
it against Reagan in the 1980 Rep primary.

---

If pro-business, supply-side, pro-rich approaches worked, growth would
have been much higher during the post-Reagan era who was the king of
supply-side-ism.. Corps had all kinds of handouts in the form of tax
cuts, deregulation, and a crushed labor movement.. Yet, growth post
80s has been abysmal. Why? Lopsided income distribution destroyed the
purchasing power of the middle class. They were the many, the would-be
consumers, yet the voodoo economics of Reagan and his later copycats,
Democrat and Republican alike, failed to make money trickle down to
them.

It is highly likely there will be another attempt on DJT's life. This

This is one area u definitely *want* to be self-reliant.

Politico: "The Pentagon has spent decades building, funding, and
nurturing a global web of suppliers and companies that now face
tariffs. With no carve-outs for defense, the administration could undo
much of that work while delaying American-made weapons production for
the country and other buyers"

Alo Japan: "The 38-meter-long tugboat, which was developed and built
as part of The Nippon Foundation’s Zero Emission Ships Project, was
launched on March 28. The vessel features twin 12-cylinder
hydrogen-blended engines (4,400 horsepower class) and combines
hydrogen with traditional marine fuels to reduce CO2 emissions by
approximately 60% compared to conventional tugboats.

Furthermore, the tugboat is equipped with facilities to store
approximately 250 kg of high-pressure hydrogen gas to maintain the
same operational performance as when using conventional fuel, the
shipbuilder explained, adding that 'in the unlikely event of failure
of the hydrogen fuel system, the vessel can operate with only
traditional marine fuels, thus ensuring the same level of safety as
conventional vessels'"

Where is the surface state I've been talking about? The ground zero
for the concept would be the Congress, right? That is where big money
interfaces with governance, at the very top, esp. more easily
congressional level because they can pick off individual
representatives one by one... They've been doing this for decades now,
the result is a do-nothing Congress, and massively low popularity.

Surah Al-Mujadila: "Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the
heavens and whatever is on the earth? If three converse privately, He
is their fourth. If five, He is their sixth. Whether fewer or more, He
is with them wherever they may be. Then, on the Day of Judgment, He
will inform them of what they have done. Surely Allah has 'perfect'
knowledge of all things"

Many things remained obscure, secret for a long time.. That is all
about to change. It is all coming out. Don't think no one sees or
hears. Fear Allah.

Stew first dry later, could be a better method even on modern

---

Sun drying works very well.. In fact it was recently [discovered](https://news.mit.edu/2024/how-light-can-vaporize-water-without-heat-0423)
it is not about the heat but the light rays' direct effect that causes
much of the evaporation / drying.

Watching a docu about Hungarian goulash. They would stew the meat down
in a large kettle until there was no liquid left, eat some, dry the
rest in the sun, like native Americans did with pemmican from bison
meat, then if you need meal add dry meat some water and vegs in a
cauldron cook, and have a brand new soup. The claim is this is why
goulash spread first in Hungary and later in Europe.

Lei: "Despite record-breaking financing in Hong Kong and the
announcement of ultra-fast charging technology, China’s leading EV
maker is likely to follow the same trajectory as [China's Evergrand],
due to its 'high debt, high turnover, and high leverage' growth
model. In China, BYD faces mounting quality concerns. [Here] are [the]
hidden risks threatening its future:

1. Lack of technological innovation
2. Hidden debt
3. A fragile supply chain"

Battery-electric tech suffers from diminishing returns. Faster
charging brings in more complexity and degrades the battery
faster. You can't beat physics. Electric tech can never beat the speed

Allowing massive concentration of wealth is like allowing people to
yell out "fire" in a crowded theather... These are both examples of
self-reinforcing feedback loops. Panic can build on itself and spread
like wildfire dwarfing everything else, same thing can happen with
massive wealth concentration, it will build on itself, grow and grow,
eventually taking all assets from the middle class and even from the
government itself. At the end, every one except the top will end up
poor.

SAN: "According to data compiled in the 2022 water plan from the Texas

SAN: "The Permian Basin, located largely in West Texas, is the most
productive U.S. oilfield and generates roughly 1 billion gallons of
wastewater daily [due to fracking]. This wastewater is highly
contaminated, containing chemicals, potentially radioactive elements,
and salt levels up to seven times higher than seawater. Despite these
challenges, lawmakers and industry leaders are exploring ways to treat
and repurpose the water for non-potable applications, such as
agriculture and industrial projects. However, the treatment process is
highly energy-intensive. Estimates suggest treating the entire volume
of wastewater from the Permian Basin could require up to 26 gigawatts
of power — more electricity than what’s generated in 30 U.S. states"

Sheryl [Sandberg] says, 'I appreciate that there was substantial
pressure and scrutiny this year on global tax rules and arrangements,'
and thanks Kenny for his 'careful' and 'considered' handling of
it. What she’s thanking him for is an additional five years of double
Irish for Facebook..

Kenny starts explaining the pressure he’s facing. 'Now, you know
Ireland had no choice but to comply with what these other
countries....'  Sheryl interrupts. 'Did you know Facebook has over
five hundred employees from fifty-four nations based in Dublin, and
we’ve just leased a building with capacity for over two thousand
employees?'  'Have I told you about the Knowledge Development Box?'
Kenny asks with a twinkle in his eye. 'Sarah, stop taking notes,'
Sheryl instructs, knowing Kenny’s about to tell us how he’s going to
keep the gravy train going for us. She doesn’t want it written
down. My notes can be subpoenaed."

The Guardian: "The social housing secret: how Vienna became the
world’s most livable city.. In the Austrian capital, renters pay a
third of what their counterparts do in London, Paris or Dublin. How is
it possible?..

Welcome to Vienna, the city that may have cracked the code of how to
keep inner-city housing affordable. As other cities battle spiralling
rental prices, partly fuelled by inner-city apartments being used as
short-term holiday rentals or being kept strategically vacant by
property speculators, the Austrian capital bucks the trend.

Part of the reason Schranz’s apartment is so affordable is simple:
it’s owned by the city. In Vienna, that is (almost) the norm. The
landlord of approximately 220,000 socially rented apartments, it is
the largest home-owning city in Europe (in London, which has more than
800,000 socially rented apartments, they are owned by the local
councils). A quarter of the people who live in Vienna are social
tenants – if you also include the approximately 200,000 co-operative
dwellings built with municipal subsidies, it’s more than half the
population"
