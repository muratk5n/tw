<p>F24: "How Donald Trump engineered the Gaza deal.. [M]ost of Trump's
efforts had been behind the scenes, as he sought to pressure a
reluctant Benjamin Netanyahu and win Arab support...</p>
<p>Trump has shifted from giving Israel a "blank check" to a conditional
stance...Trump was also privately incensed by Israel's attack on Hamas
members in fellow US ally Qatar while negotiations were at a sensitive
stage. He used Arab unity against the attack to get them all to agree
to the plan.</p>
<p>He then ambushed Netanyahu, making him call Qatar's leader from the
Oval Office to apologize. Trump even sat holding the phone for
Netanyahu while the Israeli leader read from a piece of paper, a photo
released by the White House showed...</p>
<p>Firstly, the plan he laid before Netanyahu and Israeli officials had
already been drafted following extensive consultations with Arab and
Muslim leaders at the United Nations the previous week.</p>
<p>When Netanyahu was confronted with it, he found there were key areas
in it that he had sworn not to accept, especially on his refusal to
allow a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Hamas responded [partial acceptance].. There was no mention of the
fact that Hamas had not fully agreed to most of the other points in
his plan. But instead of quibbling over the details, Trump pushed
Israel, Hamas and their mediators to quickly thrash out a deal.</p>
<p>Trump told the Axios news outlet that he had said to Netanyahu: '"Bibi,
this is your chance for victory.' He was fine with it. He's got to be
fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you got to be fine""</p>

<p>Turning Point spokesman Andrew Kolvet confirmed the authenticity of

<p>In the text messages, Kirk privately complained that a Jewish donor
had withdrawn a $2 million investment into the organization because he
refused to disinvite Carlson from the upcoming AmericaFest event.</p>

<hr />
<p>Sornette: "[8/4] Since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the
U.S. equity market has been buoyed by one unprecedented monetary
intervention after another: QE1, QE2, QE3, Operation Twist, and what
was essentially QE-infinity. Even major shocks—2018’s rate-driven
selloff, the COVID-19 crash of 2020, and the losses of 2022—were
rather brief and followed by aggressive recoveries, aided by dovish
central banks and unprecedented fiscal expansion. In recent years, the
U.S. federal government has run deficits around 7% of GDP—levels
historically associated with wartime or deep recessions—despite
operating in a context of peace and nominal full employment. The
source of U.S. market exceptionalism is no mystery: it has been driven
by this relentless policy support, a potent mix of ultra-loose
monetary conditions and fiscal largesse, rather than by organic or
sustainable economic fundamentals. This cocktail of interventions has
inflated asset prices, masked structural fragilities, and fostered a
dangerous illusion of resilience.</p>
<p>The U.S. market has come to represent nearly 70% of global market
capitalization, despite the U.S. economy accounting for only ~24% of
global GDP. This imbalance is amplified by record-breaking
concentration: over 33% of U.S. equity value is now housed in just the
20 largest firms—a degree of dependence that has no historical
precedent.</p>
<p>All this converges to a troubling picture: a market propped up not by
resilient fundamentals, but by layers of leverage, fiscal deficits,
speculative AI and tech euphoria, and massive defense spending...</p>
<p>Trump’s return and his tariff escalation are not historical
aberrations. They are symptoms of a long unaddressed social and
economic decay. The last two decades have seen exploding inequality
growth, real wage stagnation, and the erosion of the middle class—the
backbone of functional democracies. Much like the French
Revolution—where poorly managed famines following successive crop
failures ignited long-simmering social tensions—the rise of today’s
populist movements is a direct consequence of persistent elite
mismanagement and failure to address deepening inequality...</p>
<p>Expect high volatility, deeper corrections, and a breakdown of the
AI-tech-shale-military bubble that has dominated capital
flows. Mega-cap concentration will unwind painfully. Value stocks may
perform better, but broad indices like the S&amp;P 500 are likely to
struggle for years."</p>
<hr />
<p>Didier Sornette is a physicist who applied the mechanics of material
breakdown to financial markets, predicting bubbles and crashes. His
latest newsletter above.</p>
<hr />
<p>MIT Economics: "Some predictions have claimed AI will double growth or
at least create a higher growth trajectory than usual. By contrast, in
one paper, <em>The Simple Macroeconomics of AI</em> published in the August
issue of Economic Policy, [economist] Acemoglu estimates that over the
next decade, AI will produce a 'modest increase' in GDP between 1.1 to
1.6 percent over the next 10 years, with a roughly 0.05 percent annual
gain in productivity"</p>
<hr />
<p>Financial Times: "Lately, [AI] optimism has become a self-fulfilling
prophecy. The hundreds of billions of dollars companies are investing
in AI now account for an astonishing 40 per cent share of U.S. GDP
growth this year... Since the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population
own 85 per cent of U.S. stocks, they enjoy the largest wealth effect
when they go up...</p>
<p>In a way, then, America has become one big bet on AI. Outside of the
AI plays, even European stock markets have been outperforming the
U.S. this decade, and now that gap is starting to spread... What that
suggests is that AI better deliver for the U.S., or its economy and
markets will lose the one leg they are now standing on."</p>

<p>Chollet: "You can teach a Transformer to execute a simple algorithm if
you provide the exact step by step algorithm during training via CoT
tokens.</p>
<p>This is interesting, but the point of machine learning should be to
<em>find</em> the algorithm during training, from input/output pairs only --
not just memorize an externally provided algorithm. Pretty trivial
program synthesis techniques can achieve just that in the case of
multiplication.</p>
<p>Because if you already have the algorithm, you can just write it down
and execute it instead of training a Transformer to inefficiently
encode it."</p>
<hr />
<p>Paul: "A beautiful paper from MIT+Harvard+ @googledeepmind
👏.. Explains why Transformers [used in LLM neural nets] miss multi
digit multiplication and shows a simple bias that fixes it. The
researchers trained two small Transformer models on 4-digit-by-4-digit
multiplication. One used a special training method called implicit
chain-of-thought (ICoT), where the model first sees every intermediate
reasoning step, and then those steps are slowly removed as training
continues."</p>
<hr />
<p>Chollet: "The point of our work isn't to build an artificial
human. The universe is full of questions far more interesting than our
own reflection. The point is to create a new kind of mind to help us
explore &amp; understand the universe better than we can ourselves. The
way to think about AGI is as a scalable, efficient formalization &amp;
implementation of the scientific method. Not a brain in a jar."</p>

making peace with Palestinians.. Two years after Hamas triggered the
ongoing war in the Gaza Strip with its all-out invasion of Israel,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be facing the toughest
moment of his decades-long career. His principal supporter, US
President Donald Trump, has told him to make peace with Palestinians —
and he would not take no for an answer.</p>
<p>But Netanyahu cannot afford peace.</p>
<p>Domestically, continuing the war favours Netanyahu, and, indeed,
prolonging the conflict with the Palestinians has always worked to his
advantage, and now Trump’s push for peace has cornered him, says
Muddassir Quamar, a scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the
Centre for West Asian Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU),

<p>We should not try to mimic exactly how nature does things. We can
learn, get inspiration from it, but humans solve things differently. A
plane does not fly like a bird. Our math, our formulations
generalize. You can't compete with nature at micro level, you would
need a computer as big as the nature for that, and it still wouldn't
be fast enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>HRMs introduce more structure into black-box neural-net artificial
intelligence systems. An analogy is we don't try to simulate fluid
dynamics starting with tiny water molecules, we use math to
generalize, there is always top-down structure imposition. HRMs raise
the level of abstraction, they attempt to mimic the outward effects,
abstract steps of thought via guidance rather than bottom up
micro-monkey interactions hoping it will reach intelligence. It's like
hoping unfettered markets with micro-monkey interactions of people,
bihnesses can lead to walhalla, vs controlled capitalism. LLM neurons
relied on tiny components whose magical, chaotic interrelations would
supposedly bring about Artificial Superintelligence. They failed. HRM
is pointing towards the new way.</p>

<p>Paper: "Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task
decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired
by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while
maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes
sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit
supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent
recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract
planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed
computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000
training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data,
yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including
complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes."</p>

<p>"Bush was pivoting to a War on Drugs as a new frontier for defense
contracts".. Them defense contracts</p>
<p>Katz, <em>Gangsters of Capitalism</em>: "Noriega rose through the ranks of
the National Guard of Panama, a force created during the Cold War
along the lines of the Somozas’ militia in Nicaragua.  While being
paid by the U.S. government to spy on leftist movements in Panama in
the early 1960s, he enrolled at the U.S. Army’s School of the Americas
training center, then based in the Canal Zone. (Noriega’s fellow
alumni included the future heads of death squads and secret police
across Latin America.) In 1970, Noriega was made Panama’s chief of
military intelligence. A year after, he was formally put on the
payroll of the CIA..</p>
<p>In January 1989, a former director of the CIA, George Herbert Walker
Bush, became president of the United States. Noriega, who had started
working with Bush in 1976, must have thought he had won the
lottery. But with the Cold War coming to an end, Bush was pivoting to
a War on Drugs as a new frontier for defense contracts, surveillance,
and a pretext for military control. Once in office, Bush turned on his
erstwhile employee, calling for Noriega to step down and imposing
crippling sanctions on Panama. On December 15, 1989, the Panamanian
national assembly named Noriega the country’s 'maximum leader of
national liberation' and symbolically declared war on the United
States. The next day, a group of U.S. troops got into an argument with
PDF soldiers at a roadblock in El Chorrillo. A Marine lieutenant named
Robert Paz was shot.  He died soon after at Gorgas Hospital in the
former Canal Zone. On December 20, citing the Colombian-born
U.S. Marine’s death as a justification, the United States invaded
Panama for the second time."</p>
