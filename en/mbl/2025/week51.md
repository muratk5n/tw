"@PabloMartini@climatejustice.social

.. Austrian broadcaster, ORF, which will host Eurovision 2026, has
said it will not ban Palestinian flags from the event or edit out the
audience’s boos against Israel. The move appears to be an attempt to
prevent more nations boycotting the event next May after Iceland,
Ireland, Spain, Slovenia and the Netherlands all announced their
refusal to take part if genocidal Israel is allowed to compete... The
2025 contest was criticised for dubbing over widespread audience
booing against Israel with cheering.

Such a move was undoubtedly part of a propaganda attempt to create a
false impression of public support for the occupation – one that went
as far as alleged intensive and expensive efforts by the Israeli
government to rig the public vote, leading to changes in voting rules
for future contests.

Eurovision 2026, the 70th contest since its founding, will have the
fewest contestants since 2023. If it did the right thing and removed
one, it would immediately gain back five more and prevent boycotts far
more certainly than broadcasters having to promise not to censor
booing or Palestine flags."

The paper questions the validity of the Big Bang hypothesis relating
to CMB.

Pavel Kroupa: "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies,
corrected for foreground effects, form the foundation of cosmology and
support the Big Bang model. A previously overlooked foreground
component is the formation of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs),
which can no longer be ignored, particularly in light of JWST’s
detection of massive, evolved systems at extreme redshifts (z > 13)."

NYT finally remembered its journalistic duty and did a deep dive on
Epstein's past. What took you so long?

---

NYT: "In his first two decades of business, we found that Epstein was
less a financial genius than a prodigious manipulator and
liar. Abundant conspiracy theories hold that Epstein worked for spy
services or ran a lucrative blackmail operation, but we found a more
prosaic explanation for how he built a fortune. A relentless scammer,
he abused expense accounts, engineered inside deals and demonstrated a
remarkable knack for separating seemingly sophisticated investors and
businessmen from their money. He started small, testing his tactics
and seeing what he could get away with. His early successes laid the
foundation for more ambitious ploys down the road. Again and again, he
proved willing to operate on the edge of criminality and burn bridges
in his pursuit of wealth and power"

Loureiro worked on nuclear fusion, not nuclear fission. With fission

"We sell weapons to country X so it can protect itself from neighbor
country Y". Then X becomes militarized and becomes a threat to Y. Y
invades X. More chaos but someone gets richer, US can sell even more
weapons to X. This is the story of US foreign policy (if you can call
it that). The so-called policy is basically the international sales
department of the arms industry. The "strategic" reasonings are a
cover to hide this fact from you.  There is no strategy. There is no
deep state. There is no empire. It's all on the surface, plain for
anyone to see. It's all about munee and bihness.

The guy esp. focused on something called "magnetic reconnection".. The

Plasma turbulence = strange attractors?

---

For people who are looking for a field that steers away from the
bullshit and "incompleteness" of recent science (even though "it
computes") plasma physics could be a great new area. There is a lot to
do and the end result could be, literally, fusion - you know the thing
that is always 30 years away?

---

Studying non-linear dynamics one can see where deterministic, simple
(even Newtonian, like, pre-Maxwell), non-linear systems of equations
lead to incredibly complex and sometimes unexpected outcomes. What
Loureiro says below makes perfect sense.

I see.. That piqued my interest.

Some reports suggested the gunman was affiliated with HTS, likely an

be HTS leader is too pro-US, and some in his org do not like that. The
attack on US troops would harm Shara's standing, is a message targeted
to him.

[Geek] Dude says yeah some people argue MCMC can be slow but is it
slower than vanilla machine learning plus cross-validation? Good
point... He equates a hierarchical probabilistic model which defines
correct ranges, distributions with its "prior" parameters to one that
doesn't but then has to find optimal values via brute-force
cross-validation (fitting the model many, many times). This is a good
comparison to make, and in many cases likely true. There will be cases
where you would still use CV even in the MCMC scenario, but most of
the time MCMC posterior sampling already gave you an optimized version
of what parameters could be, within natural workings of its
machinery.[/geek]

Commentary on Verba since 2020s has been positive. One expert labeled
it as "game changer". If its reported capabilities are true, that is
possible. Verbe detects low flying objects using three sensors
-ultraviolet, near infrared, and mid-infrared-, has better accuracy,
it can deny airspace to drones within a large enough bubble that gives
true protection from much feared drone tech.

"[2020] The most advanced Russian portable anti-aircraft missile
system 'Verba'.. has received new capabilities. Thanks to its
automated controls, it can attack even targets that are invisible to
the operator’s eye.. This will create a 'security dome' impenetrable
for drones over troops with a radius of 6 km and a height of over
four."

*Teen Vogue* now publishes articles on inequality? 

---

Ayres, *Teen Vogue*: It’s impossible to have that much money without
profiting off of other people's lack of it. Even if individuals are
only implicated discreetly, the capitalist class generates profits
upwards by denying workers a living wage, engaging in exploitative
labor practices (directly or indirectly along the supply chain),
ensuring that medicine and health care costs remain high, or lobbying
for or even simply benefitting from favorable taxation policies and
cushy government subsidies. Wealth is also able to accumulate via
close proximity to power, with corporate connections leading to
elected office, or merely allowing people to use their influential
status to set the agenda according to their own interests. This is
known as plutocracy, or rule by the rich, and it undermines democracy.

Israel is the perfect stooge to hide behind, it checks a lot of boxes.
Jews are the ultimate victims, so even Israel's rabid expansionism can
be hidden by "their right to defend themselves", or "right to exist"
as if they are almost always in danger of another Holocaust. They are
a tiny religion-based ethno state in a region who do not share their
religion. They are in a region whose borders were drawn up by the West
post WWI that created bizarre groupings that can be exploited, through
a client-state (Israel) thereby creating more demand for weapon
systems.

Jacobin: "[2024/7] A dazzled Congress gave Netanyahu fifty-eight
standing ovations, lasting about half of the speech’s duration and
marking a record in US history, or perhaps any country’s history, at
more than 400 percent the number Kim Jong Un receives in North Korea,
thus breaking Netanyahu’s own record from 2015, when his
forty-three-minute speech received forty-three standing ovations and
rounds of applause from nearly every single US lawmaker. After a long,
torturous hour of cheering and clapping, lawmakers scrambled on the
House floor to shake Netanyahu’s hand."

Bernie Sanders: "As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis stated in

The New Scientist talked to one systems theorist who is "disconcerted"

---

MEE: "[Reporters Without Borders] reports that 43 percent of all
journalists slain in 2025 were Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israeli
forces in targeted attacks, a scale the organisation says is
"unprecedented in recent history"... Yet, despite the severity of
these findings, major western news outlets that sanctimoniously
champion press freedom and human rights found little space for the
deadliest year in RSF's records, much less that the overwhelming
majority of those journalists were Palestinian...

And few institutions illustrate this selective outrage more clearly
than The New York Times, whose editorial board had the gall last month
to condemn US President Donald Trump [bcz of Khashoggi] over his
meeting with Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman"

TAC: "Ordinary Republicans are not as pro-Israel as they once were. In
2022, just 27 percent of Republicans had a negative view of
Israel. Now it stands at 37 percent. Among Republicans under 50, half
hold a negative view of the Jewish state. This is the future of the
GOP. It doesn’t sound like “pro-Israel” will be one of their core
tenets...

Republicans are notably less hawkish than they were in the George
W. Bush era. A plurality of Republicans either want to cut or entirely
eliminate funding for Ukraine. By comparison, a majority of Democrats
want to increase funding for Ukraine. Republicans are less likely now
to back NATO and other international commitments. Republicans are not
as greatly concerned with foreign affairs as think tankers are. It was
ranked near the bottom of issues that 2024 voters cared about...

It’s unclear what voters Con Inc. expects to win over with
neoconservatism, which lost decisively in 2008 and 2012 in the general
election and 2016 in the Republican primary. There’s not a great
demand for the return of Paul Ryan or Jeb Bush"

In a way the Opium War started because of a trade imbalance.. China
was selling more to Britain than was buying from it, so Britain used
its military to force China to buy a product from it (opium). Not that

Edward Luttwak: "Because the world’s shipping insurance companies
promptly raised their rates [due to Houthi threat] , shipping via the
Red Sea and Suez Canal fell steeply, as more and more ships to and
from Asia avoided the danger by going all the way round the Cape of
Good Hope and the great bulge of West Africa. Thus the most important
of commercial routes, from Shanghai to Rotterdam, was extended by some
4,900 nautical miles...

For some trades, the extra costs were easily absorbed, and for others
they were fatal. But the losses to Europe’s Mediterranean ports and
the cities that depend on them — Barcelona, Marseille, Genoa and Gioia
Tauro among others — caused by the loss of traffic was absolute:
Europe’s freight now arrived in Rotterdam or Antwerp and continued to
French, Italian and Spanish cities by rail, leaving the Mediterranean
ports bereft of Asian traffic.

By then, Trump had heard that the fight with the Houthis was extremely
expensive for the US Navy. Its destroyers, built to defend its
multi-billion aircraft carriers from Russian and Chinese anti-ship
missiles, only had $2.5-million “standard missiles” to attack Iran’s
cheap drones and crude anti-ship missiles, themselves copied from
older Chinese designs.

It was at that point in the US Navy briefing that Trump asked about
European navies and their role in fighting the Houthis.  When he heard
that just the Mediterranean navies of France, Italy and Spain.. had
some 200 combat vessels including aircraft carriers, he naturally
asked how many of their ships were fighting the Houthis. And he was
genuinely shocked by the answer: almost none.

All three countries had refused to join the suggestively named
Anglo-American “Prosperity Guardian” mission because it involved some
air attacks against Houthi weapon depots. This reticence disregarded
the fact that the Houthis were not Yemen’s government but merely
rebels. Either way, after doing nothing, the EU navies stationed two
small ships in the upper Red Sea under the hugely over-publicised
“Aspides” mission, which intercepted a total of four Houthi ballistic
missiles, alongside 18 drones. Compare this to the 400 drones and
missiles intercepted by the US Navy, all at 100 times the cost.

Upon receiving this information, Trump did not ask his National
Security Advisor.. to convene a meeting to discuss US options: he
simply ordered the US Navy to immediately abandon the Prosperity
Guardian fight against the Houthis, supposedly employing some choice
language about the idiocy of exhausting US naval missile stocks to
safeguard the commercial freight of Nato Mediterranean countries:
whose own warships lolled idly by instead of defending their
commerce....

All this set the stage for Trump’s new approach to the Ukraine war...
the number of EU troops sent to Ukraine? Zero. That is ultimately why
the Trump plan has made its concessions to Putin. It is not a pretty
spectacle to see Washington replacing unconditional support for
Ukraine with an ultimatum to end the war or else"
