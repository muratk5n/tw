JCB: "Leading contractor BAM Construction.. has been trialling the
first JCB 540-180H Loadall on the Tea Factory regeneration project in
Digbeth, Birmingham. Powered by a hydrogen combustion engine developed
by JCB at its plant in Derbyshire, the machine offers a zero-carbon
emission driveline, that offers the same power and torque
characteristics as the conventional diesel-powered model.

'We’ve noticed no difference in the way the machine operates. We have
to refuel the machine in a different way, but it’s a simple and
straightforward process.'

JCB has been delivering hydrogen to the site in a refuelling trailer,
that simply connects to the Loadall and refuels at the touch of a
button"

Letting stray dogs roam about likely was a toxic mix of pre-modern
feudal customs seeping into modern daily life. Dogs were first
attracted into agrarian human habitats (the oldest ones being in and
around Anatolia) bcz of its trash, some stayed around and made
themselves useful, became domesticated. They were useful to have
around the farm. But out on the street, amidst the hubbub of modern
life they are out of place. Almost all modern cities ban stray dogs,
"Turkey" was the rare holdout.

TR culls stray dogs after toddler dies in attack? There was a major

Politico: "Senate passes spending bill to avoid a government
shutdown..While Republicans control the Senate, they do not hold the
60 seats necessary to break a filibuster. Ultimately, 10 Democrats
voted with Republicans to advance the bill to avoid a shutdown...

The vote highlights deep divisions within the Democratic party over
how to respond to President Trump in his second term. The decision by
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to support the funding
bill sparked an intense backlash from House Democrats, who almost
unanimously opposed it"

an absolute Li abundance of A(7Li) ≈ 2.2, which differs from the
expectation from big bang nucleosynthesis"

Brooke Harrington: "Somebody very aptly described these libertarians
as like indoor cats who don't understand what outdoors is, they think
they're like these fiercely independent 'Kings of the Jungle', 'change
my litter', 'feed me fancy feast', that's what they are like, they are
absurd people.. Not too far from where I live like 20 minutes drive
from my house is Grafton New Hampshire which is the site of yet
another failed libertarian experiment, that famously got run out of
town on a rail by bears, because these losers didn't bank on the fact
that they were living in the middle of a forest with animals. That's
how indoor cats they are...

Their ideas cannot fail, they can only be failed. That's a religion,
that's not even politics, and that's why it's so hard point out to
these people 'your ideas don't work' because they they don't have a
rational orientation to them"

Slate: "A new study published on Monday by Opportunity Insights, a

suspected: that there is essentially affirmative action in college
admissions for students who are very rich.

Indeed, 1 in 6 Ivy League students have parents in the top 1 percent
of the income bracket. Being in a family in the top 1 percent
increases your chance of admission by 34 percent. Being in the top 0.1
percent doubles it"

NYT: "Houthi Drones Could Become Stealthier and Fly Farther.. A new

into Yemen that will provide Houthi fighters a technological leap

Houthi drones powered by traditional methods like gas-burning engines
or lithium batteries can fly about 750 miles. But hydrogen fuel cells
would enable them to fly three times that distance and make it far
more difficult for acoustic and infrared sensors to detect them"

That is wrong advice. Both countries should produce both products
because that increases their econ diversity increasing internal
know-how which can benefit the design of a third product.

"While Adam Smith is regarded as the father of classical economics, the
science of economics would not have developed as it did without the
contributions of David Ricardo..

Famously, Ricardo illustrated comparative advantage and the benefits
of free trade in *Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817)*
using trade between England and Portugal as an example. He presented a
case where Portugal can produce both cloth and wine at lower costs
than England, thus giving Portugal what is referred to as the
'absolute advantage', However, in Portugal, the opportunity cost, that
is, the potential gains that are given up by selecting one alternative
over others, is less for the production of wine than cloth, while the
inverse is true in England. This means that Portugal has a comparative
advantage in the production of wine, while England has a comparative
advantage in the production of cloth. Ricardo reasoned that, if
Portugal were to specialize in the production of wine, while England
were to specialize in the production of cloth, both countries would
benefit"

"[Philippe Migault, director of the European Centre for Strategic
Analysis (CEAS) said] 'The Poles and Italians do not want to deploy
troops to Ukraine [for a peacekeeping force], nor do the Hungarians or
Slovaks. As for the French army, it could only mobilise a few thousand
soldiers, much like the British.'..

The United States, meanwhile, has long made it clear that it has no
intention of sending troops to Ukraine, as stated by Defence Secretary
Pete Hegseth. President Donald Trump has also remained vague about
whether Washington would underwrite a Europe-led troop deployment,
which is likely to be stretched thin.

'It is difficult to envisage a force larger than 40,000 troops,' said
Elie Tenenbaum, director of the Security Studies Centre at the French
Institute of International Relations (Ifri)"

CMC: "During a US-ROK joint military exercise, two ROK [South Korea]
Air Force fighter jets mistakenly dropped eight MK-82 bombs — each
weighing 227 kilograms — onto civilian homes. The bombing left at
least 29 people injured and destroyed several buildings. If such bombs
were to strike a densely populated area, the consequences would be
unimaginable. This botched "erroneous bombing" not only shocked people
at home and abroad but also compels reflection: Whose security do
these US-ROK joint military exercises actually protect?

Despite being labeled as 'defensive,' these military exercises have
long served as a catalyst for bloc confrontation and escalated
regional tensions. Under the guise of "safeguarding peace", these
exercises claim to counter the so-called "DPRK threat." Yet, far from
easing tensions on the peninsula, such muscle-flexing have only
exacerbated conflicts"

Inequality would screw up velocity. All sorts of moneys would flow,
one-directionally to the rich, and stay there, simply invested in
assets, not good for velocity (nor the economy).

A simple way of computing velocity for US is dividing GDP by the money
stock, eg `M2`.

The Jerusalem Post: "Armed Israeli settlers stole hundreds of sheep

---

PKK (seperatist TR Kurds) declaring unilateral cease fire is a
sweetner for the goobble gobble Anatolians so internally their pol
looks ok when they essentially accept the same Kurdish elements having
a state in NE Syria. A Syrian journo claims HTS leader Shara was
forced into the deal by the West. For PKK it made sense too, as stated
before, they now have a 100k strong army in NE Syria, they do not need
bunch of rugged guerillas running around on the mountains.

---

The Irish Times: "Hope for Syria as government and Kurds sign deal to
merge forces.. Kurdish community to get citizenship and language
rights denied under Assad regime"

---

The rumor is PKK leader Ocalan wants to be a spiritual leader of sorts
to NE Syria (Rojova), perhaps he is afraid "foreign elements"
encroaching on that territory and he wants to help them in some
way. The Israel proposed land bridge would connect into the area,
remember, he might also want to placate the Anatolians so they don't
feel the need to attack.

---

PKK was helped by Syria a lot in its early history. They were a
barganing chip of sorts against the TR's dam building. Obviously
the opression of Kurds by the state played a role too.

---

On a related event, TR Kurdish seperatist group PKK declared ceasefire
after ~50 years of fighting TR, they were being prodded to it by the
founder.

Their headquarters were in Northern Iraq.

One commentator said 'no big deal' from their persp in terms of
Kurdish resistance, 10k lay down arms, but there is now a 100k strong
army in NE Syria. PKK had made a play for that region after the civil
war started and managed to hold on. See timeline.

Reduced immigration, onshoring can help local wages, but even if they
doubled, it's not enough. Your puny salary can go from 30k to 60k, but
median house since mid-2000s went from 200k to 400k. Massive wealth
concentration caused that. That skewed distribution has to be corrected.

Action Network: "Big Medicine has driven us to a breaking
point. Doctors are pulled away from patient care –– sometimes from the
literal operating table –– by UnitedHealth Group and other insurance
conglomerates seeking new reasons to deny coverage. Patients with
asthma and other chronic illnesses routinely leave the pharmacy
counter empty-handed because middlemen play games with which
prescription drugs they will cover and at what cost -– with sometimes
fatal consequences. More than one third of Americans live in
healthcare deserts, largely because insatiable insurer greed has
driven independent medical practices and pharmacies out of
business. Employers and unions are being crushed by ever-increasing
premium costs, which further cut into workers’ wages. And all of us
live in fear that one illness could destroy our physical and financial
health...

[T]he U.S. healthcare system today is at the mercy of corporate
hospital systems, private equity investors, and vertically-integrated
monopolies and middlemen, who wield their market power to gouge
patients, workers, taxpayers, employers, independent pharmacists, and
unions..

We need a Glass-Steagall-style reform for health care, to eliminate
the structural conflicts of interest that drive up costs and lower
quality of care!

Sign on to our demand to Break Up Big Medicine!"

There were times the system could exploit the exubarence to trim off

allow that excess money to disappear, the "system" (read: the rich)
were bailed out. The bubble continued. GFC was the perfect time where
the wealthy screwed themselves, gov could entrench that position, do a
much needed redistribution. But thankfully the wealthy and the corps
had their man inside, who bailed them out, now gets paid in kind via
"speeches".

Turchin is the creator of [this formulation](../../2024/05/age-of-discord-math.html)

Unchecked oligarchy causes inequlity, immiseration. But the errant
process contains seeds of its own destruction. Elite overproduction
will cause internal conflicts within the elite. At some point a good
number of elites eliminate themselves, and the cycle goes to a more
manageable state.

Anti-Russia sentiment of the "Third-Way" Democratic party is the
result of its decades long Republicanization. Thanks to Bill Clinton
this party not only adapted right-wing econ issues it also became
hawkish, perfectly aligning itself with the military industrial
private complex. During the 90s under the guise of "helping" Russia it
helped its plunder by its internationally connected oligarchs. They
started the expansion of NATO so more weapon sales could be made by
that same industry already experienced producing weapons compatible
with NATO specs. Dems eventually became NRINOs, Not Republican in Name
Only. Their anti-Russia sentiment is completely in line with them
being bootlickers of the industry and followers of right-wing
ideologies except a few bullshit culture war issues which are just
there for cosmetics.

---

"UA RU war started back in 2014". You could actually take the starting
point back to the 90s when US-led liberal order was wreaking havoc in

degree. What changed?

If light is a wave not particle (See Robert Masse) and there can be no
spooky-action-at-a-distance, no entanglement, that means quantum
computation is a farce... This is in opposition to Barandes, whose
inherently stochastic approach to QM still allows for quantum
computation.

We will see who is correct based on whether quantum supremacy is
achieved (it still isn't, despite claims to the contrary) then
indivisible stochastic process explanation has a leg up. If on the
other hand faster-than-deterministic quantum computation is
impossible, then Masse's aether model has an advantage.
