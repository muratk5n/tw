But this development isn’t the only culprit for our current health
insurance crisis. After all, those with employer-sponsored coverage
are also facing major insurance price hikes. In truth, experts say
this moment has been decades in the making, fueled by lax oversight of
health care consolidation that has given hospitals and health insurers
enormous market power — and the freedom to keep raising prices"</p>

<p>ZDNet: "The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has unveiled a new

remove all proprietary code from mobile devices. That code includes

operate.</p>
<p>Although several projects, such as GrapheneOS, postmarketOS, and
/e/OS, have removed Google-specific software from the Android Open

components for hardware support. Kooyman said that mobile computing
has long been "the last frontier of software freedom," and that it
remains dominated by closed ecosystems, such as Apple's iOS and

<p>Obviously the "backstabber" take along with labeling oneself as "Turk"
and trying to reconnect with distant cousins in distant lands (in
someone else's backyard) are all part of TR's delusional national
identity, all somehow magically helping the Anglo. Need I mention who
helped the Arabs with the said backstabbing? They even made a movie
about it, starring Peter O'Toole.</p>
<hr />
<p>The title is having a little fun, it emphasizes there is an Arab in
the picture, TR military is known as staunchly nationalistic and their
reading of history says Arabs were "backstabbers" (towards the
Ottomans) and here is the TR general in the same frame with an Arab.
Also the rough streotype of an Arab is a religious person (although
close watchers of the region know Arab rulers keep Islamist movements
at bay) and the ultra-secularist TR military man is a contrast with
that.</p>
<p>The wording itself: El Habibi means "friend", "dear" in Arabic, the
second part is not Arabic, made to sound like it, it is actually
gobble gobble chosen to rhyme with the first. It can rougly be
translated to <em>ass doctor</em> (it's a stupid high school joke).</p>

<p>Apparently LLama folk wrote low-level interfaces for graphics cards
other than just NVidia GPU. This is a good thing, that interface code

<hr />
<p>LLMs are just another type of neural network. If the "weights (a list
of numbers)" are available, anyone can run an LLM on their own
machine, no outside connection needed. Training a large NN takes a lot
of resources, but using a trained NN requires less.</p>
<p>Llama is an open source tool / site, it hosts open-data LLMs. Install
the tool and it lets you choose from a list, pick one, it downloads,
installs the weights. Then via the prompt one can talk to a local LLM
neural network. With a few hundred GB of RAM, a good graphics card,
even a large model should run fine.</p>

HI, THIS IN IT'S SELF IS NOT A VISUAL BUT A CONTACT OF AN ALIEN TYPE BEING WITH
MY DAUGHTER IN OUR OWN BACK YARD IN THE SUMMER OF 1987. SHE SPEAKS OF IT ONCE IN
AWHILE AND WHAT SHE HAS SAID, AS I HAVE ASKED HER, THAT THE BEING WAS SOMETHING
THAT SHE HAS NEVER EVER SEEN. I ASKED HER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE, SHOWN HER ANIMAL
BOOKS,AND TRIED TO GET A PICTURE IN MY MIND OF WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. SHE
DOESN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AS SHE WAS REAL SCARED AT THAT TIME AS SHE
HAS TOLD ME.SHE DOES REMEMBER THAT THE BEING WAS AS TALL AS SHE, AND SHE WAS 5
YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME, AND THAT IT SCARED HER. SHE DID SAY THAT IT WAS ON TWO
LEGS NOT FOUR AND DID'NT LOOK LIKE ANY ANIMAL. NOW I KNOW SHE WAS ONLY 5 YEARS
OLD AT THAT TIME BUT I DO BELEIVE HER. THIS INFO MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU ARE

<p>Using "LLM searches" is like walking on thin ice.. One trick could be
always connecting conversation to real papers written by real people,
not letting LLM veer off towards odd directions. </p>
<hr />
<p>While working with LLMs you get the feeling you are <em>managing</em> a
booksmart, mechnically clever but a junior programmer (or scientist).
I did some tech management and it feels exactly this way. You provide
direction, with that they execute and connect some dots, but can also
make big mistakes.</p>

What is that mirror like ball in the sky?On the way home from work I traveled
the expressway.And comming up over a rise in the road,I noticed a round
cylindrical,metalic object that was smooyh and shiny! As I looked closer I
noticed that there was what appeared to be rivets like that of skyscrappers use
to hold girders together.Also that it had an orange/yellow color. When I went
down the next hill to try and get closer for a better look it was gone. as
Iapproached the area where I'd seen this thing I noticed that there were
contruction vehicles parked in a field,backhoe's and things of that nature. All
I could think was that whatever it was,was checking out our capability to
construct large machinery. I mention to my family what I had seen and of course
they thought me crazy! So when I found this site,decided to see if anyone else
had seen anything like I had.Also I have to add that when it disappeared it
happened so quickly like it kneww I was watching. I'm totally blown away by this
incident,hopeing your organization can shed some like on this subject.

<p>Review: "<em>Good Fortune</em> is a very different film for Lionsgate. It's a
heartfelt comedy that surprisingly has a lot of intelligent insight on
income inequality and economic struggles in the US...</p>
<p>I was not expecting to enjoy <em>Good Fortune</em> as much as I did..  the
film has an important, timely message about the state of the American
economy that way too many people will be able to relate to. Think of
it as a much more socially conscious version of Kevin Smith's <em>Dogma</em>.</p>
<p>Audiences will find it easy to see themselves in Arj, a character who
reflects the sad truth about the times we're living in. He's a college
graduate who finds himself barely scraping by, doing menial tasks like
delivering food or standing in lines for people, all while sleeping in
his car. The truth is, the job market is at an all-time low, and it's
harder than ever for qualified people to earn the roles they
deserve. As a soon-to-be college grad about to enter the job market,
this film terrified me as much as it made me laugh. Keanu Reeve's
performance as Gabriel is an absolute riot, it's surprising how well
he fairs in absurdist comedy after years of being cast as the stoic
action hero. If any casting agents are reading, please cast him in
more comedies!"</p>

<p>I would throw in one of those open LLMs too (an LLM is nothing but
bunch of "weights", parameter values that make it "intelligent"). LLMs
can be good for looking up existing stuff, generating "boilerplate"

<p>Backstop? As in government <em>bailout</em> if your investments fail? Why do

same LLM tech to different applications, or potentially incrementally

<p>Offering hallucination machines as a service is one thing. But when
Google wanted to know something, I mean <em>really</em> wanted to know
something, as in reports effecting their bottom-line (knowing for sure
if a campaign succeeded or not, or a page alternation causing visits
to go up or not, enter change-point analysis), you see what they did,
they resorted to <em>real science</em>, not data approximation and parrot
NNs. Why don't they feed their numbers into a f-ing neural net LLM and
ask it "ew, bro, was that campaign good, do I have some rizz on my
biz?". They don't because they know they can't trust the answer they
would get.</p>
<hr />
<p>GOOG apparently wrote a <code>tensorflow-probability</code> package as well that
is used by <code>causalimpact</code>. I was hoping the AI hype would instigate
this, by encouraging the development of base computational tools like
<code>tensorflow</code> (GOOG), <code>torch</code> (FB) that provide some of the low-level
fundemantal computational architecture for LLM AI, the rest of the
scientific computing would benefit as well, you could use TF for
numerical weather prediction for instance.</p>
<hr />
<p>For the change-point analysis I used Bayesian Structural Time Series
Approach, via one software package written by Google (they open
sourced it, good job), called <code>causalimpact</code>. Google still has some
life left in it, there is a residue of scientific spirit there, they
are not yet wholly taken over by neural net monkeys (the base tech of
LLMs) where they shove shit into a black box and turn the crank,
hoping it outputs something AGI-like. BSTS is a deeply mathematical

more than the other side.</p>
