In comp history ENIAC is more frequently cited for its code breaking
applications, but it turns out MANIAC is closer to a true ancestor of
modern computing devices of today.

---

Wiki: "In 1956, [the computer] MANIAC I became the first computer to
defeat a human being in a chess-like game. The chess variant, called
Los Alamos chess, was developed for a 6×6 chessboard (no bishops) due
to the limited amount of memory and computing power of the machine."

We saw the failure of democracy up close just recently, haven't we?
Instead of abolishing a broken ACA and legislating something better,
Dems played political games over the old, broken system via shutdown.

---

"Nearly half of Western voters think democracy is broken, international
poll finds.. The survey comes amid growing concern that democracy
across the West is under threat. Wealth inequality around the world is
driving support for extremist parties, undermining debate and
preparing the ground for authoritarianism, according to a recent
report for the G20."

"The political scene in California is about to change as Dr. Butch
Ware, who was Dr. Jill Stein's 2024 running mate on the Green Party
presidential ticket, has announced his candidacy for the state's

CNBC: "China economic gloom mounts as housing slump intensifies and
investment slides.. China's slowdown worsened in October, dragged by
soft consumer demand and a deepening property downturn."

The Lever: "The Enshittification Of Health Care, Explained.. The
massive spikes in health insurance premiums are a result of decades of
lax regulations and industry consolidation... Much of the blame has
focused on the likely expiration of enhanced premium tax credits,
which will drive up rates for Affordable Care Act Marketplace plans.
But this development isn’t the only culprit for our current health
insurance crisis. After all, those with employer-sponsored coverage
are also facing major insurance price hikes. In truth, experts say
this moment has been decades in the making, fueled by lax oversight of
health care consolidation that has given hospitals and health insurers
enormous market power — and the freedom to keep raising prices"

---

ZDNet: "The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has unveiled a new
initiative called LibrePhone, with the ambitious goal of a completely
free software smartphone ecosystem.. Project LibrePhone wants to
remove all proprietary code from mobile devices. That code includes
firmware, drivers, and the binary "blobs" that phones must have to
operate.

Although several projects, such as GrapheneOS, postmarketOS, and
/e/OS, have removed Google-specific software from the Android Open
Source Project (AOSP) codebase, the devices still rely on closed
components for hardware support. Kooyman said that mobile computing
has long been "the last frontier of software freedom," and that it
remains dominated by closed ecosystems, such as Apple's iOS and
Google's Android."

---

Obviously the "backstabber" take along with labeling oneself as "Turk"
and trying to reconnect with distant cousins in distant lands (in
someone else's backyard) are all part of TR's delusional national
identity, all somehow magically helping the Anglo. Need I mention who
helped the Arabs with the said backstabbing? They even made a movie
about it, starring Peter O'Toole.

---

The title is having a little fun, it emphasizes there is an Arab in
the picture, TR military is known as staunchly nationalistic and their
reading of history says Arabs were "backstabbers" (towards the
Ottomans) and here is the TR general in the same frame with an Arab.
Also the rough streotype of an Arab is a religious person (although
close watchers of the region know Arab rulers keep Islamist movements
at bay) and the ultra-secularist TR military man is a contrast with
that.

The wording itself: El Habibi means "friend", "dear" in Arabic, the
second part is not Arabic, made to sound like it, it is actually
gobble gobble chosen to rhyme with the first. It can rougly be
translated to *ass doctor* (it's a stupid high school joke).

---

TR-Qatar relationship started a while ago.. I found the link below in
my TR posts, back from 2010/05. That guy in the picture is a Qatari
guy with the TR general.

Apparently LLama folk wrote low-level interfaces for graphics cards
other than just NVidia GPU. This is a good thing, that interface code
can help other applications.

---

LLMs are just another type of neural network. If the "weights (a list
of numbers)" are available, anyone can run an LLM on their own
machine, no outside connection needed. Training a large NN takes a lot
of resources, but using a trained NN requires less.

Llama is an open source tool / site, it hosts open-data LLMs. Install
the tool and it lets you choose from a list, pick one, it downloads,
installs the weights. Then via the prompt one can talk to a local LLM
neural network. With a few hundred GB of RAM, a good graphics card,
even a large model should run fine.

 Kittery, ME
HI, THIS IN IT'S SELF IS NOT A VISUAL BUT A CONTACT OF AN ALIEN TYPE BEING WITH
MY DAUGHTER IN OUR OWN BACK YARD IN THE SUMMER OF 1987. SHE SPEAKS OF IT ONCE IN
AWHILE AND WHAT SHE HAS SAID, AS I HAVE ASKED HER, THAT THE BEING WAS SOMETHING
THAT SHE HAS NEVER EVER SEEN. I ASKED HER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE, SHOWN HER ANIMAL
BOOKS,AND TRIED TO GET A PICTURE IN MY MIND OF WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. SHE
DOESN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE AS SHE WAS REAL SCARED AT THAT TIME AS SHE
HAS TOLD ME.SHE DOES REMEMBER THAT THE BEING WAS AS TALL AS SHE, AND SHE WAS 5
YEARS OLD AT THAT TIME, AND THAT IT SCARED HER. SHE DID SAY THAT IT WAS ON TWO
LEGS NOT FOUR AND DID'NT LOOK LIKE ANY ANIMAL. NOW I KNOW SHE WAS ONLY 5 YEARS
OLD AT THAT TIME BUT I DO BELEIVE HER. THIS INFO MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR BUT I HOPE IT HELPS IN SOME SMALL WAY.((NUFORC Note:  Date is
approximate.  PD))

Using "LLM searches" is like walking on thin ice.. One trick could be
always connecting conversation to real papers written by real people,
not letting LLM veer off towards odd directions. 

---

While working with LLMs you get the feeling you are *managing* a
booksmart, mechnically clever but a junior programmer (or scientist).
I did some tech management and it feels exactly this way. You provide
direction, with that they execute and connect some dots, but can also
make big mistakes.

---

LLM made a huge mistake again.. says a certain figure on a paper was X
but it was Y. Literal hallucination.

NYT: "[08/07] For three weeks in May, the fate of the world rested on
the shoulders of a corporate recruiter on the outskirts of
Toronto. Allan Brooks, 47, had discovered a novel mathematical
formula, one that could take down the internet and power inventions
like a force-field vest and a levitation beam.

Or so he believed.

Mr. Brooks, who had no history of mental illness, embraced this
fantastical scenario during conversations with ChatGPT that spanned
300 hours over 21 days...

Mr. Brooks is aware of how incredible his journey sounds. He had
doubts while it was happening and asked the chatbot more than 50 times
for a reality check. Each time, ChatGPT reassured him that it was
real. Eventually, he broke free of the delusion — but with a deep
sense of betrayal"

 Canton, OH
What is that mirror like ball in the sky?On the way home from work I traveled
the expressway.And comming up over a rise in the road,I noticed a round
cylindrical,metalic object that was smooyh and shiny! As I looked closer I
noticed that there was what appeared to be rivets like that of skyscrappers use
to hold girders together.Also that it had an orange/yellow color. When I went
down the next hill to try and get closer for a better look it was gone. as
Iapproached the area where I'd seen this thing I noticed that there were
contruction vehicles parked in a field,backhoe's and things of that nature. All
I could think was that whatever it was,was checking out our capability to
construct large machinery. I mention to my family what I had seen and of course
they thought me crazy! So when I found this site,decided to see if anyone else
had seen anything like I had.Also I have to add that when it disappeared it
happened so quickly like it kneww I was watching. I'm totally blown away by this
incident,hopeing your organization can shed some like on this subject.

Wasn't Ansari Me Too'd a while back? Maybe the powers that be felt his
anti-system leanings, and tried to snuff him out early... Clearly they
failed. Usually Woke is a cover, corp misdirection for something
else...

---

You have to hear Rogan's diatribe against his own class at the
end.. He did great too. Ansari wrote a fine script, and somehow
sneaked it around the corporate overlords.. Five stars.

---

Keanu... He finally did a solid for the left. 👍 

Review: "*Good Fortune* is a very different film for Lionsgate. It's a
heartfelt comedy that surprisingly has a lot of intelligent insight on
income inequality and economic struggles in the US...

I was not expecting to enjoy *Good Fortune* as much as I did..  the
film has an important, timely message about the state of the American
economy that way too many people will be able to relate to. Think of
it as a much more socially conscious version of Kevin Smith's *Dogma*.

Audiences will find it easy to see themselves in Arj, a character who
reflects the sad truth about the times we're living in. He's a college
graduate who finds himself barely scraping by, doing menial tasks like
delivering food or standing in lines for people, all while sleeping in
his car. The truth is, the job market is at an all-time low, and it's
harder than ever for qualified people to earn the roles they
deserve. As a soon-to-be college grad about to enter the job market,
this film terrified me as much as it made me laugh. Keanu Reeve's
performance as Gabriel is an absolute riot, it's surprising how well
he fairs in absurdist comedy after years of being cast as the stoic
action hero. If any casting agents are reading, please cast him in
more comedies!"

There will not be Windows post apocalypse. Its closed source nature
dooms it to insignificance during a time when survival matters,
not profit.

---

Are they saving large, static data files over there (that are usually
not in a *source code* repository, like Github)? Geographic data,
historical records, all books would be nice as well.

I would throw in one of those open LLMs too (an LLM is nothing but
bunch of "weights", parameter values that make it "intelligent"). LLMs
can be good for looking up existing stuff, generating "boilerplate"
code.

Does the vault also have a few beefy hardware setups that can run all
that? I am talking machines with a few hundred GB RAM, good graphic
card (for its GPU). I'd keep a couple powerful but commodity machines
that are kept up-to-date with the latest FOSS Unix variant OS, just to
make sure the hardware is compatible.

---

GitHub Arctic Code Vault.. it stores all active Github source code
repositories at the North Pole. Some of my stuff went, after the
apocalypse humanity will have a great add-on for the Emacs editor,
guaranteed. You can type coding docs fast while your ass is chewed
by zombies.

So-called Turks of Anatolia need to let go of these useless fantasies,
"reconnecting" with distant cousins so forth.. Most in the Stans don't
give a fying frack about them. They might be Turkic but you are not.
For some bizarre historical reasons between the "interwar period" TR
founders made an already assimilated marginal ethnicity as the main
ethnicity and tried to create a new identity around it. The project
has been a failure.

One commentary I read suggested Dems knew they would never get
agreement on the ACA subs extension, but merely wanted to "register a
protest" before the subsidies expired, and the shutdown achieved
that. Maybe they were banking on the fact that shutdowns effect Reps
more, which it did, and DJT approval fell, Reps were dealt a blow,
their kabuki theater paid off.

CNN: "Senate votes to end government shutdown, sending funding bill to
the House.. A small band of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans on
Monday night to approve a funding measure to reopen the federal
government — without securing their party’s demand to guarantee an
extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies"

Backstop? As in government *bailout* if your investments fail? Why do
you need so much compute? LLM improvements already stalled, you are
not getting better accuracy with increased hardware. No expansion
needed there.

If you need additional compute for horizontal expansion, applying the
same LLM tech to different applications, or potentially incrementally
adapt / train for different domains, well, these are investments, you
have to find funding for them just like any other organization.. They
might give you funds, or not, judging the risk.. the usual. Why are
you somehow different?

Offering hallucination machines as a service is one thing. But when
Google wanted to know something, I mean *really* wanted to know
something, as in reports effecting their bottom-line (knowing for sure
if a campaign succeeded or not, or a page alternation causing visits
to go up or not, enter change-point analysis), you see what they did,
they resorted to *real science*, not data approximation and parrot
NNs. Why don't they feed their numbers into a f-ing neural net LLM and
ask it "ew, bro, was that campaign good, do I have some rizz on my
biz?". They don't because they know they can't trust the answer they
would get.

---

GOOG apparently wrote a `tensorflow-probability` package as well that
is used by `causalimpact`. I was hoping the AI hype would instigate
this, by encouraging the development of base computational tools like
`tensorflow` (GOOG), `torch` (FB) that provide some of the low-level
fundemantal computational architecture for LLM AI, the rest of the
scientific computing would benefit as well, you could use TF for
numerical weather prediction for instance.

---

For the change-point analysis I used Bayesian Structural Time Series
Approach, via one software package written by Google (they open
sourced it, good job), called `causalimpact`. Google still has some
life left in it, there is a residue of scientific spirit there, they
are not yet wholly taken over by neural net monkeys (the base tech of
LLMs) where they shove shit into a black box and turn the crank,
hoping it outputs something AGI-like. BSTS is a deeply mathematical
approach, not random monkey shit

If Venezuella is invaded, then Reagan would have liked him.

Reagan would not approve of an anti-globalist Trump. He would chase

once to suggest he would've been buddies with him, but he is blowing smoke
up your ass. 

---

Shutdowns are tricky for Reps. The blame does not automatically go to
the executive in charge, there've been Democrats in office during
shutdowns and the other side was blamed. I believe Reps being the
official "anti government" party (that pungent stench of rabid
Reaganism) when the government shuts down, the blame sticks on them
more than the other side.
