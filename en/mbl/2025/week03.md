It looks like we have DJT to thank to on this one 👏👏👏

Al-Monitor: "The Israel-Hamas deal was made possible by 18-hour days
and a 'remarkable' partnership between Joe Biden and Donald Trump's
Mideast envoys.. Trump said the 'epic' win would never have happened
without his election putting pressure for a deal"

This is the way

CNBC: "Spain plans to tackle housing crisis with 100% tax on homes
bought by foreigners"

---

Politico: "A top progressive group [Justice Democrats] has a plan to
forge a way forward after Democrats' brutal election cycle: a renewed
push to primary members of its own party... 'There is something wrong
with this party as a whole right now,' [said a spox], 'and it’s time
to clean up shop in this Democratic Party.. The 2024 election showed
that the party establishment didn’t learn its lessons'.. And
Democratic members coming into this Congress should be on notice:
'Their primary starts now... Voters want to see a Democratic Party
that is serious about taking on the wealthy elite and getting big
money out of politics, not parade around billionaires as campaign
surrogates'"

---

The example works, strange combination of AND, OR and bitshift
operator plus a recursion. It does look like the type of code that
could be built up from simpler components, during a program search.

```python
addition(123,345)
```

```text
Out[1]: 468
```

---

FC claims AGI needs to learn programs rather than representations
memorized out of words via brute force. It should be possible to learn
a program like below, not the usual algorithm for addition, after
seeing few examples of addition. 

---

Chollet: "Here for instance, our model of addition is an algorithm
expressed in terms of binary operators.

```python
def addition(x,y):
   if y == 0: return x
   return addition(x^y, (x&y) << 1)
```

A model of this kind will generalize strongly. It will be able to
return the right answer. The exactly right answer. For any input at
all even inputs very far from the distribution of inputs that your
agent may have seen before. That is strong abstraction. This is where
LLMs still fall short"

---

```python
u.modis_fire(34.11778266, -118.504923,"2025-01-13",370,"map02.html")
```

[[-]](map02.html)

---

Francois Chollet: "There's been lots of talk about how LLMs perform 'in-context
learning' to adapt to new problems. But what seems to actually happen
is that LLMs are fetching memorized programs that map to the current
prompt.

If they don't have a memorized program ready – if they're faced with
something slightly unfamiliar, no matter how simple – they will
fail. Even when the novelty comes in the form of a small variation of
a problem they did memorize.

Zucman, *The Triumph of Injustice*: "FDR’s strategy worked as long as
successive administrations upheld the New Deal–era belief system. That
changed in the early 1980s. 'Government is not the solution to our
problem; government is the problem,' Reagan famously said in his
inaugural address of January 1981. If some people were tempted to
eschew taxation, they were not to blame: high, 'un-American' tax rates
were.  In the new ideology that swept through the United States in the
early 1980s, dodging taxes became the patriotic thing to do. Since
'taxation was theft,' according to the revived libertarian creed, it
was also the moral thing to do.  Until the 1970s, successive
administrations had fought the tax-avoidance industry. When Reagan
entered the White House in 1981, the industry became
government-approved. The tax-sheltering frenzy could start.

And *frenzy* doesn’t begin to capture the scale of what happened. The
industry mushroomed. A network of financial entrepreneurs, promoters,
and advisers stormed the market. Some of these inventors required
their staffers to come up with one new idea a week. They brimmed
with creativity and produced groundbreaking tax dodges. Whenever the
IRS shut down a particularly egregious scheme, several others would
spawn"

Libération: "[French PM] François Bayrou's future rests on one word:
'Suspension.'  The socialists, who have been negotiating with the
government for a week to rebalance the budget, want to hear it
pronounced by the Prime Minister during his general policy statement
(DPG) this afternoon in the Assembly. 'Regardless of the concessions
elsewhere, the media debate is currently focused on pensions, we will
not give up ,' warns a socialist executive. At the end of last week,
the socialist negotiators at least stated an 'agreement of views' on
local authorities, housing and even overseas territories. A tax on
wealth is also under consideration, inspired by the economist Gabriel
Zucman. 'Lombard is giving us signals, he wants to give us the
possibility of not censoring,' says the same socialist. But he also
tells us that in the end, 'it is Bayrou who will decide. If he commits
to suspending the pension reform, we will not vote for the motion of
censure, even if we are the only ones on the left'"

FCW: "On January 10th, the first batch of 406 hydrogen fuel cell
sanitation vehicles equipped with GWM Hydrogen-FTXT's hydrogen power
system were officially delivered to customers, marking the successful
implementation of GWM's first 'hundred-unit level' hydrogen sanitation
vehicle demonstration application scenario in Baoding, China.

This batch of hydrogen sanitation vehicles includes three main models:
hydrogen sweeping and washing vehicles, hydrogen cleaning vehicles,
and hydrogen high-pressure flushing vehicles. They were jointly
developed by GWM Hydrogen-FTXT in collaboration with three well-known
Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturers - Changzheng, Yutong, and
Dongfeng. All vehicles are equipped with GWM Hydrogen-FTXT's
self-developed commercial vehicle fuel cell system and hydrogen
storage system. Compared to electric sanitation vehicles, they have
significant advantages such as faster fuel replenishment and better
adaptability to high and low-temperature environments. It only takes
5-8 minutes to complete hydrogen refueling, and a single refueling
allows for continuous operation of over 10 hours"

Space Explored: "New Glenn's second stage, known as GS-2, consists of
two BE-3U engines that are powered by liquid oxygen and liquid
hydrogen. Compared to traditional rocket fuels like RP-1, which is a
highly refined form of kerosene, hydrogen is much more efficient"

GeekWire: "New Glenn's first stage is powered by seven of Blue
Origin's BE-4 engines, fueled with liquefied natural gas. The second
stage makes use of two hydrogen-fueled BE-3U engines

Recent move away from shitlibbery is good, this one, not so good.

404media: "Meta is deleting links to Pixelfed, a decentralized
Instagram competitor. On Facebook, the company is labeling links to
Pixelfed.social as 'spam' and deleting them immediately. Pixelfeed is
an open-source community funded and decentralized image sharing
platform that runs on Activity Pub, which is the same technology that
supports Mastodon and other federated services. Pixelfed.social is the
largest Pixelfed server, which was launched in 2018 but has gained
renewed attention over the last week"

"@todayilearned@noc.social

TIL a UK trial of a 4-day workweek with 61 companies was so successful
that 54 kept it, and most made it permanent. Employees worked less but
stayed just as productive, with some companies seeing revenue grow by
35%. Workers also reported better health, less burnout, and even
losing weight"

But everyone says Keanu is such a nice guy, we should not say bad
things about him... His fans might get upset.

---

We do not talk about any material concerns here, bunch of Woke shit,
coupled with anti-government propaganda (what Matrix is truly all
about) so the corps paying us benefit, we mark ourselves important get
paid in millions, call it a day. *Next question*

---

NEXT QUESTION

---

I remember another interview around 2000 they asked Keanu about the
Seattle anti-globalisation protests, and how that might relate to the
first movie, he just cuts off the intervier, says "next question!". 

---

I watched the cast interview for Matrix 4, they were discussing
whether "a man plugging into the Matrix as a woman" would be *so
scandalous* the studio would think nixing it... Imagine that.. with
all the problems in the world, this is where you choose to focus? Here
is the level of rebelliousness of their art... All-blue Dem dimwits

Keanu Reeves is the worst, total shitlib too..

There aren't many w/ brains in Holywood...

Anderson, *Private Government*: "Consider some facts about how
employers today control their workers. Walmart prohibits employees
from exchanging casual remarks while on duty, calling this 'time
theft.' Apple inspects the personal belongings of their retail
workers, who lose up to a half-hour of unpaid time every day as they
wait in line to be searched. Tyson prevents its poultry workers from
using the bathroom. Some have been forced to urinate on themselves,
while their supervisors mock them. About half of U.S. employees have
been subject to suspicionless drug screening by their employers.
Millions are pressured by their employers to support particular
political causes or candidates. If the U.S. government imposed such
regulations on us, we would rightly protest that our constitutional
rights were being violated. But American workers have no such rights
against their bosses"

Make A Stand

The whole worldview is patently dumb, and, hilariously, loud and
proud. Pure Anglo. US/UK has 'free'-marketism deep in its cultural
DNA. That base is working against them now. You need to fight this
shit like you fight cancer, or any other serious ailment. Either you
kill it, or it kills you.

Note the brash, brazenness of this neolib delusion. Muckers live in a
lala land.

Philips, *Wealth and Democracy*: "Using consumption as a gauge works
to overstate popular well-being, all the more so because its
measurements ignore assets and leave out debt burdens, which climbed
most during periods like the 1920s, 1960s, and the 1980s and 1990s
precisely for those least able to afford them.  By an even more
expansive view, consumption had become part of the new edifice of
democracy-as-market. By driving a car, buying a movie ticket, or
watching a television commercial, U.S. consumers participated every
day in the democracy of the marketplace, or so suggested the editorial
pages of the Wall Street Journal. What was widely purchased was, ipso
facto, democratically approved. Buying and selling, indeed, was a
large part of what democracy was about...

Markets would become the democratic rulers in the nineties, said
banker Walter Wriston: 'Markets are voting machines; they function by
taking referenda.'  Ultimately even the proletariat would 'fight to
reduce government power over the corporations for which they work,
organizations far more democratic, collegial and tolerant than distant
state bureaucracies.' Broadcaster Rush Limbaugh, too, wanted to 'let
the marketplace rule.' Former House speaker Newt Gingrich dreamed
about the possibility of establishing a 'consumer-directed
government,' once even suggesting that major questions could be
resolved by simply asking 'our major multinational corporations for
advice'"

Beginning of aughts remember CA had a budget hole causing the "Total
Recall" election. The new governator did not fix the problem though,
bcz he is a strapping, upstanding capitalist himself.

---

Stevenson, *The Trading Game*: "[2011, the presenter] had a bunch of
charts. He went through them one at a time. On each one was the fiscal
situation of a single country. Italy. Spain. Greece.
Portugal. Ireland. Also the United Kingdom, the US, Japan. They were
all variations on the same story. All these governments were spending
more than their income year after year and their debts were growing.
If things kept going in the same direction, the interest rates on
their debts would start rising. People would stop lending to them, and
they’d have to sell their assets. That would be bad...

What I couldn’t get out of my head was this sense of similarity. It
was the same. The government of Spain, the government of America, the
government of Japan... Outgoings more than their income. Losing the
ability to borrow money. More and more income going into servicing
debt.  Losing their assets. The situation was the same...

But it came up against the economics though.. We’re in a monetary
system. The whole thing always has to be in balance. For everyone
who’s in debt, there’s someone who’s in credit. For everybody losing
money, there’s somebody who’s gaining. The whole system is designed to
be in balance. Not only that, but what about the houses?  What about
the stock market that was rising and rising? These assets weren’t
disappearing. But if we didn’t own them, if the people didn’t own
them, and the governments didn’t own them...Then who did?..  [T]hat
was the moment that it hit me, [I was] surrounded by
millionaires. [They owned the debt, along with most of the other
assets]"

---

Countries, states reducing services, being in debt is an issue
involving taxation. Neolibs kept talking down gov, reduced their
spending, decreased biz regulation, well, now you *burn in fire*.

---

Why the decrease in tax collection? Maybe CA should've kept it at 2022
levels and increase gov services, so there would be more firefighting
capability.  

```python
df = u.get_fred(1990, ["CATOTLTAX"])

Chollet: "[2024/12] OpenAI o3 ARC-AGI Results [which measures
abstraction capability].. OpenAI's new o3 model.. mark[s] a
qualitative shift in AI capabilities compared to the prior limitations
of LLMs. o3 is a system capable of adapting to tasks it has never
encountered before..  Of course, such generality comes at a steep
cost, and wouldn't quite be economical yet: you could pay a human to
solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly 5 dollars per task (we know, we did
that), while consuming mere cents in energy. Meanwhile o3 requires
$17-20 per task in the low-compute mode...

o3's improvement over the GPT series proves that architecture is
everything. You couldn't throw more compute at GPT-4 and get these
results. Simply scaling up the things we were doing from 2019 to 2023
– take the same architecture, train a bigger version on more data – is
not enough...

[But] I don't think o3 is AGI yet. o3 still fails on some very easy
tasks, indicating fundamental differences with human intelligence...
Furthermore, early data points suggest that the upcoming ARC-AGI-2
benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially
reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart
human would still be able to score over 95% with no training). This
demonstrates the continued possibility of creating challenging,
unsaturated benchmarks without having to rely on expert domain
knowledge"

---

I thought as much.. differentiability is used to find optimum point of
a cost function. If program has to learn programs however, rather than
a function, differentiation might not make sense for that. Deep
Learning built a massive expertise around automatic differentiation,
backpropagation that might not apply to this new approach.

---

"[E]xtending neural networks with more programmatic elements
necessarily means abandoning the idea of end-to-end
differentiability. An example is Chollet's observation that 'if
machine learning models become more like programs, then they will
mostly no longer be differentiable—certainly, these programs will
still leverage continuous geometric layers as subroutines, which will
be differentiable, but the model as a whole would not be. As a result,
using backpropagation to adjust weight values in a fixed, hard-coded
network, cannot be the method of choice for training models in the
future—at least, it cannot be the whole story'"

---

Chollet argues "program synthesis" is the way to go for AGI. AI needs
to learn programs rather than representations of word clouds (current
apprach). If programs can be learned, AI can adapt to new situations
better, we are a step closer to true AGI.

Next up: Reaganites remember governments can tax and need the money

James Woods says when officials tell you to evacuate don't wait
around, leave! I guess he is saying *listen to the government*. Wasn't
he some kind of Reaganite right-winger who wants small government? I
guess during emergency everyone remembers there is such a thing as gov
whose presence is not tied to profit motive, and is there to help you.
