science of economics would not have developed as it did without the
contributions of David Ricardo..</p>
<p>Famously, Ricardo illustrated comparative advantage and the benefits
of free trade in <em>Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817)</em>
using trade between England and Portugal as an example. He presented a
case where Portugal can produce both cloth and wine at lower costs
than England, thus giving Portugal what is referred to as the
'absolute advantage', However, in Portugal, the opportunity cost, that
is, the potential gains that are given up by selecting one alternative
over others, is less for the production of wine than cloth, while the
inverse is true in England. This means that Portugal has a comparative
advantage in the production of wine, while England has a comparative
advantage in the production of cloth. Ricardo reasoned that, if
Portugal were to specialize in the production of wine, while England
were to specialize in the production of cloth, both countries would
benefit"</p>

<p>PKK (seperatist TR Kurds) declaring unilateral cease fire is a
sweetner for the goobble gobble Anatolians so internally their pol
looks ok when they essentially accept the same Kurdish elements having
a state in NE Syria. A Syrian journo claims HTS leader Shara was
forced into the deal by the West. For PKK it made sense too, as stated
before, they now have a 100k strong army in NE Syria, they do not need
bunch of rugged guerillas running around on the mountains.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Irish Times: "Hope for Syria as government and Kurds sign deal to
merge forces.. Kurdish community to get citizenship and language
rights denied under Assad regime"</p>

<p>The rumor is PKK leader Ocalan wants to be a spiritual leader of sorts
to NE Syria (Rojova), perhaps he is afraid "foreign elements"
encroaching on that territory and he wants to help them in some
way. The Israel proposed land bridge would connect into the area,
remember, he might also want to placate the Anatolians so they don't
feel the need to attack.</p>
<hr />
<p>PKK was helped by Syria a lot in its early history. They were a
barganing chip of sorts against the TR's dam building. Obviously
the opression of Kurds by the state played a role too.</p>

after ~50 years of fighting TR, they were being prodded to it by the

Kurdish resistance, 10k lay down arms, but there is now a 100k strong

conglomerates seeking new reasons to deny coverage. Patients with
asthma and other chronic illnesses routinely leave the pharmacy
counter empty-handed because middlemen play games with which
prescription drugs they will cover and at what cost -– with sometimes
fatal consequences. More than one third of Americans live in
healthcare deserts, largely because insatiable insurer greed has
driven independent medical practices and pharmacies out of
business. Employers and unions are being crushed by ever-increasing
premium costs, which further cut into workers’ wages. And all of us
live in fear that one illness could destroy our physical and financial
health...</p>

<p>Anti-Russia sentiment of the "Third-Way" Democratic party is the
result of its decades long Republicanization. Thanks to Bill Clinton
this party not only adapted right-wing econ issues it also became
hawkish, perfectly aligning itself with the military industrial
private complex. During the 90s under the guise of "helping" Russia it
helped its plunder by its internationally connected oligarchs. They
started the expansion of NATO so more weapon sales could be made by
that same industry already experienced producing weapons compatible
with NATO specs. Dems eventually became NRINOs, Not Republican in Name
Only. Their anti-Russia sentiment is completely in line with them
being bootlickers of the industry and followers of right-wing
ideologies except a few bullshit culture war issues which are just

indivisible stochastic process explanation has a leg up. If on the
