TNR: "The editor in chief of Christianity Today is warning that
evangelical Christianity is moving too far to the right.. Russell
Moore resigned from the Southern Baptist Convention in 2021, after
years of being at odds with other evangelical leaders. Now he thinks
his religion is in crisis.

Moore told NPR in an interview released Tuesday that multiple pastors
had told him they would quote the Sermon on the Mount, specifically
the part that says to 'turn the other cheek,' when preaching. Someone
would come up after the service and ask, 'Where did you get those
liberal talking points?'..

'What was alarming to me is that in most of these scenarios, when the
pastor would say, "I’m literally quoting Jesus Christ," the response
would not be, "I apologize." The response would be, "Yes, but that
doesn’t work anymore. That’s weak,"' Moore said. 'When we get to the
point where the teachings of Jesus himself are seen as subversive to
us, then we’re in a crisis'"

China Daily: Wang Zihao has been very busy receiving foreign clients
recently. His employer, Hygreen Energy, a Beijing-based company
engaged in electrolysis and hydrogen production, has seen its alkaline
electrolyzer products exported to nearly 30 countries, including the
United States, Germany and Spain, and the export volume has continued
to grow. "I just received customers from Portugal and Belgium a few
days ago, and Spanish clients are set to come soon," said Wang,
assistant general manager of the company.

More than 200 hydrogen energy enterprises have set up shop in
Beijing's Daxing district, and the industrial cluster effect has begun
to emerge. The application scenarios of hydrogen energy have covered
transportation applications, such as cold chain logistics and
passenger transport.

Mesquita, *FP Analysis and Rational Choice Models*: "Although the
opportunity for a negotiated agreement exists, a few disputes
nevertheless become wars. This seems puzzling, much as labor strikes
or lawsuits seem puzzling. Of course, from the perspective of the
welfare of a nation-state, by which I mean the welfare of the majority
of the citizenry, war, like strikes and litigation, is always *ex
post* inefficient. That is, knowing how a war turned out, there must
have existed an *ex ante*, Pareto improving outcome, an outcome that
at least could have avoided the transaction costs for each side
associated with conducting and concluding the war.

As James Fearon has argued, war, looked at from the perspective of
states, can only arise rationally if at least one of three conditions
exists: an asymmetry of information, a commitment problem, or a
dispute over an indivisible good so important a contributor to the
danger of war that it is sometimes argued that all the other
rationalist explanations are just special cases of this condition:
that war is, in Gartzke’s (1999) memorable phrase, in the error term.
Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992) and Slantchev (2003), in a more
general setting, provide models in which war can arise without
uncertainty because of commitment problems. Commitment problems arise
when one or the other party cannot trust the rival’s statements
because the rival has incentives to renege on promises.

Indivisibility means that the contest is necessarily a winner-take-all
affair so that there is no room for compromise, probably leaving the
dispute to devolve into a war of attrition.  Civil wars and other
disputes over governing a given territory sometimes are indivisible.
Naturally, if there is not some way to compensate a player for a loss
of this sort, the problem does not have a bargaining range. One side
wins and the other loses. Impatience can come into play as a source of
commitment problems or uncertainty about when the expected future
stream of benefits from behaving aggressively now will be sufficiently
large that it is worth tolerating the short-term costs of war"

---

Would warring parties fight a war if they knew the outcome beforehand?
The answer can sometimes be yes. One IR researcher had better language
around that, see above

---

UA/RU war might have some life in it yet. It can go on for another 3-4
months until one side gets its ass throughly kicked. That side likely
won't be Russia.

Richardson: "[A] reactionary mindset came to dominate the Republican
Party after Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980. Republicans began to
insist that anyone who embraced the liberal consensus of the past
several decades was un-American and had no right to govern, no matter
how many Americans supported that ideology... The idea of a small
government that serves the needs of a few wealthy people, Lincoln
warned in his era, is 'the same old serpent that says you work and I
eat, you toil and I will enjoy the fruits of it. Turn in whatever way
you will—whether it come from the mouth of a King, an excuse for
enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of men of one
race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it is all the
same old serpent'”

---

Richardson: "Lincoln had watched his town of New Salem die because its
settlers—hard workers, eager to make the town succeed—could not dredge
the Sangamon River to promote trade by themselves. Lincoln later
mused, 'The legitimate object of government is to do for the people
what needs to be done, but which they can not, by individual effort,
do at all, or do so well, for themselves'… as public roads and
highways, public schools, charities, pauperism, orphanage, estates of
the deceased, and the machinery of government itself'"

IOW if you modify copyleft licensed software, you have to make your
modification public, you cannot make it closed source. The license
enforces this. The copyleft license has been challenged in court and
it worked. This is a sneaky way of spreading openness. After a while
the network effect kicks in, good software is open, more people use
it, contribute to it, which means more good software becomes open.

---

GNU: "Copyleft [as opposed to copy*right*] is a general method for
making a program.. free.. and requiring all modified and extended
versions of the program to be free as well. The simplest way to make a
program free software is to put it in the public domain,
uncopyrighted. This allows people to share the program and their
improvements, if they are so minded. But it also allows uncooperative
people to convert the program into proprietary software.. In the GNU
project, our aim is to give all users the freedom to redistribute and
change GNU software. If middlemen could strip off the
freedom.. instead of putting GNU software in the public domain, we
'copyleft' it. Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the
software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to
further copy and change it"

CleanTechnica: "In addition to domestic production, the EU is leaning
on overseas markets to feed its green hydrogen hunger... Canada is
laying plans to export its green hydrogen to Europe through Belgium,
and stakeholders in northern Africa are eyeballing a pipeline to the
EU through Italy... *Bloomberg* reports that TotalEnergies is planning
to import green hydrogen from Brazil to supply its petroleum
refineries in Europe...

Among those other value-driving projects is the company’s massive
green hydrogen facility in Saudi Arabia, attached to the country’s
ambitious NEOM planned city. 'The NEOM green hydrogen project in Saudi
Arabia is approaching 80 percent completion, with green ammonia
production expected to commence at the end of 2026', Air Products
notes. Saudi Arabia has already lined up Germany as an off-taker for
its green hydrogen. Word of the deal with Germany surfaced in
February, and last week it became official...

Belgium tasked its Monarch, King Philippe, to travel to Vietnam with a
large entourage for some deal-making in a number of areas including
green hydrogen. The leading Belgian electrolyzer firm John Cockerill
took a preliminary step towards investing in a Vietnamese electrolyzer
factory during the trip. 'A spokesman for the Belgian firm said the
agreements were the first step for a possible investment in a Vietnam
factory to manufacture pressurised alkaline water electrolysers,'
*Reuters* reported"

Gary Stevenson: "At the moment the story we have about.. what a
wealthy economy is, is about individualism. It is about
entrepreneurism, it is about every man for himself. I think there are
good sides to this but the fact is the only power the poor and the
ordinary working people have ever had to protect themselves against
the rich is power in numbers, and when you make ordinary people
extremely individualistic, they lose that.

I have a YouTube channel that says very clearly "listen, your kids and
your grandkids are going to live in really bad poverty and the only
way to stop that is to fight together to tax the rich more".  I've
been doing that for years and the number one most common comment I get
on the channel by a million miles is "how do I make more money?". I'm
not against one person going out [saying] "I'm going to make money,
I'm going to get rich for me and my family". I'm not against that. But
we send this message out like success is all about what you put in,
when in reality success in today's society is 90% dad.. 10% which you
put in"

US / Iran is terribly disadvantageous for Iran, but Iran's GDP
probably does not capture their true innovation capacity because they
cannot trade freely due to sanctions. However I would not go crazy to
give them too much credit either, they are probably at a TR level,

Mil hardware comparison between countries shows their current build up
but not their potential. Strategist Michael Beckley says that
potential is captured in a country's GDP per capita that is a stand-in

effectiveness is GDP per capita x GDP. Backtest on history shows the
measure works well.

Suriyak: "In response to the ground operation in southern Daraa, local
forces attacked Israeli troops yesterday, wounding some of their
ranks. Meanwhile, insurgent forces and civilians killed eight people,
who were buried today in the town of Nawa.

The insurgency against Israel is taking shape. The so-called Islamic
Resistance Front in Syria is gaining followers since its creation on
December 17, 2024.

Unlike the Alawite-majority Coastal Shield Brigade, the IRFS is an
amalgam of Sunni-majority groups composed of former members of the SAA
and SSNP militias as well as rebel factions from southern Syria which
have been moving closer to Iran since the Israeli invasion after the
fall of the Syrian government.

Indeed, Tehran is trying to maintain its influence in Syria by
financing and creating a strong anti-Zionist resistance in the south
of the country similar to that of southern Lebanon. Moreover, given
the passivity of HTS and allies in the face of Israeli attacks during
the last 48 hours the IRFS will continue to gain strength within the
Southern Operations Room which could gradually become yet another
front questioning the authority of Damascus similar to that of the
Druze"
