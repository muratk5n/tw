Netflix buying WB should be preferable from a competition
angle. Paramount already had movie studios and related IP, Netflix did
not have much presence there. They improving on that front would mean
better competition.

For some reason Dana Sculley's hairstyle on *The X-Files* is the

*The Iris Affair* is Woke. Also one of the stupidest shows I've ever
seen (one ep was enough). It was all about adapting worn out tropes
and they somehow managed to screw that up.  "Subverting expectations"
also failed flat on its face.

IC: "Democrats in Congress Are Out of Touch With Constituents on Israeli
Genocide..  Genocide denial is needed for continuing to appropriate

more weaponry...

[Ro] Khanna has become more and more willing to tangle with AIPAC,
which is now paying for attack ads against him. On Thanksgiving, he
tweeted about Gaza and accused AIPAC of 'asking people to disbelieve
what they saw with their own eyes.' Khanna elaborated in a campaign
email days ago, writing: 'Any politician who caves to special
interests on Gaza will never stand up to special interests on
corruption, healthcare, housing, or the economy. If we can’t speak
with moral clarity when thousands of children are dying, we won’t
stand for working Americans when corporate power comes knocking'"

Stevenson: "[I]t looks like [Labour] are going to basically raise
taxes on absolutely everybody. Except the very rich, which is exactly
the opposite of what we campaign for here. We call for tax wealth not
work. It's going to be phenomenally unpopular.  I think it's probably
going to be another line on the gravestone of Keir Starmer
Premiership..

[T]he [UK] government is basically terrified that they do
a budget, financial markets turn against them, the government bonds
sell off, and they're forced to basically do another budget. Some
people will say.. why don't we just ignore the financial markets? And
I understand that because obviously you live in a democracy and you
expect the public to determine the policy of the government, and you
don't like to see financial markets dominate it.

The answer to that is if your economic policy is to constantly borrow
money from financial markets, then you need to keep financial markets
happy. And in a sense, this is the reason why I constantly campaign
for wealth taxes.. [S]ince COVID, inequality has increased
significantly, and one manifestation of that is a big transfer of
wealth from the government to the very rich.  And you see that in the
form of significantly higher government debt and significantly higher
savings from the very rich.

Once you've done that, then you are then in a situation where the
government, if it wants to provide things like basic services, needs
to somehow get those resources back or get access to those resources
from the very rich... [T]here's a couple of ways you can do that, but
the most obvious ways are you borrow from the rich or you tax the
rich.

If you choose not to tax the rich, then the only way for you to get
government services like the NHS, like education services, are to
borrow from the rich. So basically, as long as governments refuse to
tax the rich, they will be consistently, entirely dependent on
borrowing from the rich, which means they will need to do whatever the
financial traders ask of them.  Because they are completely dependent
on the financial traders ..[they] are the people who decide whether or
not the rich lend their money to the government.. [T]he key here to
understand why the government is raising your taxes. Is it's not
really about fiscal rules, it is a little bit about the markets, but
really, what you have here is a question fundamentally about
distribution."

It would be a major pie in the face for Dems if they get blamed for an
ACA related screw up after all they've done to lay the blame on the
Republicans including the big bad shutdown. Will karma deliver them
some consequence for creating an half-assed, corporate friendly plan?

Politico: "Democrats have vowed to hammer the GOP in the midterms if
they allow the [ACA] federal aid to expire, but many on the right
expect the political fallout to be minimal, or even to backfire on
Democrats. For other conservatives, any blowback will be worth it if
it means they get to rein in a system the party has fundamentally
opposed since its launch more than a decade ago.

'Democrats have to start acknowledging they blew it,' Wisconsin
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson told reporters Tuesday. 'Obamacare has
been a huge disaster.'"

Another experiment idea

"Vary exposure time / intensity at low flux; test the Born-rule/τ
dependence

* Reproduce the Monte-Carlo excitation idea: hold geometry fixed, vary
  the exposure time τ (or equivalently, the time window before reset
  of detectors) while keeping mean intensity low.

* Measure detection probability vs local field intensity at many
  positions across fringe maxima/minima.

The paper shows excitation probability P_exc = 1-exp(−I·τ) (their
`exctprop` function) and argues Born’s rule emerges for small τ
(linear regime) .

Predictions

* Classical-field + discrete-matter: Detection probability vs
  intensity will show deterministic deviations from linear (Born)
  scaling as τ increases: specifically saturation effects (P->1) in
  high-intensity/long-exposure, and nonlinear mapping that depends on
  τ.

* QED / standard Born rule: The Born rule gives detection probability
  proportional to intensity (for single-photon/low-intensity
  regimes). Saturation due to detector physics is recognized, but the
  dependence on exposure time (as an intrinsic mapping from classical
  intensity to detection clicks) beyond known detector saturation
  would be evidence for the alternative view.

Reading the results

* Demonstrate whether the observed I -> P mapping at low intensity
  deviates from the linear Born expectation in a way explained only by
  detector saturation (known detector models) or requires a new
  τ-dependent fundamental model.

Intensities down to single-photon equivalent rates; variable exposure
windows 10 ns to seconds; use detectors with well-known dead-time and
dynamic range."

Spraying wastewater on agricultural fields..? It sounds like better

Rolling Stone: "In the spring of 2022, Jim Doherty kept having the
same conversation with folks at the only grocery store in Boardman,
his eastern Oregon hometown, or at the grain depot where he picked up
food for his four ranch dogs. Healthy adults that these people knew
were coming down with unexplained medical conditions, including
diseases and cancers that usually afflicted the elderly. “It was kinda
grim,” Doherty says...

Water hadn’t really been a political priority for Doherty — he’s a
Republican, and he focused mostly on economic development and
transportation projects — until a couple of years into his second
term, when the uptick of stories he heard about young women enduring
miscarriages and middle-aged men with organ failure started making him
uneasy...

Doherty says he picked up 70.. test kits and went back out a week
later, this time knocking on doors across a wider swath of the
county. The results were equally bleak. Of the 70 wells he tested, 68
violated the safety threshold, with an average concentration of
nitrates close to four times the federal limit...

Every day, the megafarms and food processing plants in Morrow County
send millions of gallons of wastewater to the Port of Morrow... When
the Port sprays that water back over the farms, some of the nitrates
are absorbed by the crops, but there’s a limit to how much the sandy
soil and shallow-root plants can hold"

NPR: "The Ohio River sends billions of gallons of water flowing past
Louisville, Kentucky's pumping station every day, where the city's
utility sucks it up to turn it into tap water... One type of PFAS that
the Louisville water technicians are tracking is HFPO-DA, though it's
perhaps better known by a trade name, GenX... Almost a year ago,
workers noticed an unexpected spike in the level of GenX detected in a
sample of the raw, untreated water drawn from the Ohio River for
filtering and processing.

But Goodman's team was curious about what was going on. They traced
the chemical up the Ohio River, past Cincinnati and through
Appalachian forests, all the way to a West Virginia factory about 400
miles upstream. There, the Chemours Co. uses GenX to make
fluoropolymers, a special plastic critical to the semiconductors that
power our phones. Its Washington Works facility near Parkersburg, West
Virginia, also has a notorious history of PFAS pollution."

A potential improvement on the previous aether experiment idea..

I'll include this one too

"Instead of comparing different detectors, use one detector and test
the time-dependence prediction:

1. Fixed setup: Double-slit, single detector type, constant weak flux

2. Vary exposure time τ from very short to very long

3. Measure: Fringe visibility V as function of accumulated counts

Rashkovskiy predicts: V should decrease as V ∝ [1 - exp(-τb)]⁻¹ for  longer τ

Standard QED predicts: V constant (when normalized by total counts),
limited only by Poisson statistics

This would be a cleaner test because it isolates the claimed
τ-dependence without confounding variables from different detector
materials."

In tech terms 90s feels like eons behind us, but it wasn't that long

I am digging the 90s backdrop of *NCIS Origins*. They have cassettes,
floppy disks, landlines, and old (new to them) movie references (a
character goes "Roadhouse" on someone during a fight). I stopped
watching their other shows, but this one - not bad. I remember Franks
in the main show was a real tough son of a bitch, total
cowboy. Similar character, younger version, written well. All of the
cast have great lines. Tech critique back in the 90s knowing what we
know now lands well.

El Pais: "All programmers, from hobbyists to those working at
Microsoft or Google, use open-source software, which is present in

GitHub or GitLab to download packages of code already written,
reviewed, and improved by the community."

OK.. idea for testing elastic solid theory of Rashkovskiy and

The Guardian: "[03/24] How did childcare in the US become so absurdly
expensive?.. Many of the US’s national peers have figured out
solutions to this problem. In Denmark, parents pay at most 25% of
childcare center tuition. Canada has plans to lower the costs of
childcare to $10 a day by 2026. France offers tax credits to parents
of babies and toddlers that cover up to 85% of what the family pays
for center- or home-based care. Germany has a sliding-scale system
that charges parents based on their income.

Instead of parents paying huge childcare fees, in other wealthy
nations, it’s the government that picks up the tab, spending on
average $14,000 per child per year on early childhood
education. Compared to those nations, the US – which contributes just
500 per child annually in grants and programs serving low-income
families – is woefully behind."

Peace treaties are made when one side clearly loses and the other side
wants to cement its wins, the loser does not want to lose anymore but
can still cause trouble for the winner. So both sides have incentive
to make treaty.

Does that describe Ukraine vs Russia? Actually that describes NATO vs
Russia better; 1999, NATO took Czechia, Hungary and Poland. Then it
took Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and
Slovenia. In 2009 it took Albania and Croatia. In 2017 NATO took
Montanegro, 2020 North Macedonia. It was going to take Ukraine but
Russia, the loser of decades at this point, said **no more**. The
winner would be motivated to cement its wins, the loser can cause
trouble as it demonstrated. Both sides would be motivated to make
peace.
