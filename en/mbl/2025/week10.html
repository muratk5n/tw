<p>NYT: "Three decades ago, as vice president of technology at the
groundbreaking tech company Netscape, Mr. McCue helped democratize
information access through the World Wide Web. Now, he’s positioning
his company’s new Surf browser as part of a growing community
of.. decentralized social media options, alongside emerging platforms
like Bluesky and Mastodon.</p>
<p>The timing could be fortuitous, as online publishers struggle with an
old problem and a new threat. For years, they have worried that the
internet’s middlemen — huge platforms like Facebook and TikTok — have
weakened their ties with the people who read or view their
material. Now publishers face another issue: New A.I. systems that
could completely eliminate those fraying links with their
audiences. Surf offers a window into a quiet technology movement
echoing the early days of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>With the aid of several internet technical standards that are intended
to encourage the growth of a new kind of social media, Mr. McCue has
created a potential path where media companies can build direct
relationships with readers.In contrast to the current social web,
which is dominated by a few large technology companies, the new
software protocols may seem a bit wonky for now. But they make it
possible for internet users to communicate and share information
without relying on a single centralized service.One of the new
technical standards is known as ActivityPub. Social media platforms
using the protocol can talk to one another, allowing users on
different networks to interact seamlessly — similar to how email works
across different providers.ActivityPub was formalized in 2018 by the
World Wide Web Consortium, a technology standards-making organization"</p>

<p>To all of you that are joining us at @Vivaldi, I would like to
welcome you.</p>
<p>We know that many are looking for options away from Big Tech and we
are happy many of you are choosing us.</p>
<p>We have been building browsers for a long time now. Many of us were at
Opera.  I co-founded Opera in 1995.</p>
<p>As Opera drifted in a bad direction, I co-founded Vivaldi to provide a

<p>Why do people hold treasuries instead of being in cash, like Warren
Buffett does even in hundreds of billions? Government bonds are low
risk instruments, they produce some returns, but they are liquid which
means they can be bought and sold at ease, there is always a market
for them. Therefore they are as good as cash, little better actually,
since they provide some interest.</p>

<p>"[A] proposed [Israeli] corridor would be a passage that begins in the

Euphrates where Kurds, supported by the United States, control all
areas in the east of the Euphrates, including all regions on the
Syrian-Iraqi border. Although it is not clear where exactly Israel
would build this corridor.. reports.. indicate that the proposed
corridor would go in the south of Syria, close to the Jordanian
borders, allowing Israel to control the land between the corridor and
the Jordanian borders.. [the hope is making] Israel politically
resilient to external military challenges emanating from neighbouring
countries through providing Israel with the leverage of using
minorities in Syria such as the Druze and Kurds as proxies"</p>

<p>"Fresh clashes south of Damascus between local Druze and government
forces suggest the community may be laying groundwork for a
semi-autonomous or fully independent non-Islamic statelet before
Damascus manages to create a new government. Amid clashes in Jaramana
and Israeli military positioning, the latest movements since the fall
of the Assad regime in the area earlier in December could spell the
first post-war challenge for the [new] in Damascus, which has so far
attempted to avoid the topic of Israeli encroachment in its territory.</p>

<p>The Arab Druze, roughly 3% of Syria's population, have historically
balanced loyalty to local powers with a commitment to
self-preservation. The fall of Assad's regime in December 2024 created
both opportunity and uncertainty, particularly for those in southern
Syria. Now, with Israel vowing to "protect" them and reports of Druze
militias clashing with Syrian Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) forces, a new
political entity could emerge under Israel's influence"</p>

<p>Masse, <em>Quantum Mechanics</em>: "Two Slits Open for a Single Photon.. In
such an experiment, a single photon from the light source will still
be incident on both slits in the aperture screen at the same time, and
will produce two coherent sinusoidal wavelets that interfere
constructively and destructively.  Each of these sinusoidal wavelets
will have less energy than a photon of the same frequency, and so the
wavelets will not be photons. Moreover, the energy of the two
sinusoidal wavelets will generally not be equal.</p>
<p>When the sinusoidal wavelets reach the image screen, the destructively
interfering parts of the sinusoidal wavelets will have significantly
less energy than a photon of the same frequency, and so will be unable
to produce an observable photographic or photoelectric effect. Dark
fringes will result.  Only the constructively interfering parts of the
sinusoidal wavelets will have sufficient energy (approximately the
energy of a photon of the same frequency) to produce an observable
photographic or photoelectric effect that will contribute to forming
bright fringes on the image screen. Moreover, a constructively
interfering part of the sinusoidal wavelet must strike an atom on the
image screen just right to provide sufficient energy for the atom to
change state and eject a single electron.</p>
<p>Out of hundreds of interfering parts of the two wavelets, only one
pair will generally produce any observable effect. This effect will
usually be isolated to a single atom on the image screen. Therefore,
the constructively interfering wavelets will appear to be very
localized (at a point) similar to a single particle striking the image
screen. Nevertheless, the change occurring in an atom of the image
screen in a low-intensity experiment is due to constructively
interfering sinusoidal wavelets; not to a particle"</p>
<hr />
<p>Masse says light is a wave, not wave and particle at the same time.
People who keep looking for magical funkiness in QM forget basic facts
about waves, they have to lose energy when they pass through the slits
and split, the two new waves are syncronized but have different travel
times towards the screen, therefore they can interfere with each other
constructively or destructively. And since the two waves have less
energy only perfect contructive interference will result in a bright
image on the screen. In a single photon two-slit experiment that can
give the impression of a "particle" traveling both slits. The
explanation can really be that simple. You have to be dumber to look
for something more complex and "magical".</p>

<p>A rough timeline of West-Nato / Russia relations... The Western media
is adept at making people ignore, forget the context on everything via
a process called decontextualization. We need to look at only the
last, or a single chosen "bad act" done by a "bad actor", so that
actor can be properly villified. Such an angle helps their bottom line
justifying all arms spending enriching the military-media private
complex. Some of that hidden context is below. NATO keeps expanding,
year after year, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2017, 2020, 2024 at the
discomfort of Russia.  A military alliance that insists on keeping you
out encroaches on your border. </p>
