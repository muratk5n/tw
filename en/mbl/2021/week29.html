<p>Arriving Tatars wld have contributed "something" to Anatolia, but what
I am saying is, that something, little as it is (proportional to their
numbers) was Russian culture. </p>
<hr />
<p>Peeps are not bunch of punks from Central Cuntfuckia. Nor are they
from Crimea, culturally speaking.. Everyone in Asia Minor is closer to
Homer (of Illiad fame) culturally than to some "Kubilay", or
"Genghic".. whatever.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lots of Tatars migrated into Anatolia BTW, estimated to be at
1,800,000 btw 1870-1900. I observed in gobble gobble their descendants
were more willing to embrace the tigger identity, bcz, IMO not only it
offered them "nomadicness" (they also had recently 'arrived', right?)
but also ethnically they cld claim a certain Asiaticness. But Tatars
arriving to TR were likely Russian in nature.. Ops. Then they were
assimilated into Anatolia which is not Turkic either.. So either way,
they are not tiggers. Rejoice.</p>

<p>On the optimality of infrastructural tech choices: If H2 is the energy
carrier, there are many ways to get to it.. Tech will improve those
choices, the process over time will get cheaper and faster. Get H2
through this catalyst, that catalyst, etc. Independent parts can be
researched independently.</p>
<p>With lit batteries, the path, the goal all revolve around on thing:
lithium. No other choice. Now you are stuck; stuck with finite amount
of reserves, stuck with the way batteries are architected, all
stuck. Hallmark of bad engineering; unflexible basis, with a single
point of failure, shoddy architecture the kind that originates from
retarded, shoddy minds.</p>

<p>US gets the right people, and is culturally IMO adamant about
it.. Look at how Obama, the "black President" deported over two
million immigrants. I know two non-American national swimmers,
brothers, <em>both</em> of them won the Green card "lottery".</p>
<hr />
<p>UK was pretty quick in granting British passports to Hong Kong
citizens. IMO they want that high-skilled workforce emigrating to UK.
They care more abt that than human rights.</p>
<hr />
<p>US experienced backlash, bcz it had not built mechanisms to
redistribute. UK does have the mechanisms, just could not generate
enough capability, money to do so.</p>
<hr />
<p>Both Canada and UK took in a lot of immigrants but their GDP Per
Capita was flat. 2% ppl increase with 2% GDP increase means no change.
GDP Per Capita captures capability, power, so it is key.</p>
<p>Looking at graph we can say UK/Canada did not get skilled
immigration. For UK maybe this backfired, led to Brexit?  There are
bunch of new people around you, but you are not getting
disproportionately richer bcz of it 🤨</p>

<p>EPA: "Methane is also a greenhouse gas (GHG), so its presence in the
atmosphere affects the earth's temperature and climate system. Methane
is emitted from a variety of anthropogenic (human-influenced) and
natural sources. ... Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon
dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere"</p>
<hr />
<p>BTW all carbon, or GHG emitting rocket fuels need to be banned, eg
methane. New Shep used liquid H2 but I believe their bigger rocket,
and some others in the same scale will use methane - not good.</p>

<p>Beckley: "Yes history has shown that technological revolutions create
prosperity in the long run but every single time one of these things
has happened they have forced some workers into lower wage jobs or
into unemployment in the short run, and the short run can actually
last an entire lifetime. So if you study the Industrial Revolution,
one of the biggest technological revolutions, for the first 70 years
of the industrial revolution in the Great Britain from 1770 to 1840,
average wages actually stagnated, and living standards declined.  The
average height of men actually shrunk because they had less nutrition
over that 70 years, even as output per worker expanded by nearly 50
percent, that's because the gains from mass mechanization during that
time were largely captured by business elites...</p>
<p>[In our future, due to automation] there could be a world where you
would have sluggish growth, lots of debt, stagnant wages, for at least
a big part of the population, and extreme inequality. If you had that
kind of economic world that of course would breed nationalism and
extremism"</p>

of all carbon emissions, all time:</p>

<p>I am not entirely convinced Cuban regime wants the ambargo to end..
Why would they? It is the perfect scapegoat. Some during the 90s did
claim convincingly Castro was making moves for it, to keep the
ambargo.</p>

<hr />
<p>There are a boat load of examples where a Dem was screwed bcz of
Cuba..  You could claim Clinton lost gov in 1980 partly bcz of
Castro. Cuba sent refugees to US, Carter dumped them on Arkansas,
there was a ruckus, Cubans escaped from camp and armed citizens nearly
shot them to death. Some other factors were there 2, but the refugee
issue loomed large.</p>
