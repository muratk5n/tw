<p>Let's truly modernise ed by replacing the teacher, so the crux, the
delivery, has a guaranteed quality. Grading (only pass/fail) which
takes the least amount of time, can remain in-person, craftsman-like,
but through certifiers. The process will also be async, paving the way
for the system's eventual transition to 3W.</p>
<hr />
<p>Modernity, as in industrial production, gives you products that are
copies of a template; I buy a 27'' LCD monitor, it is exactly like the
next 27'' LCD monitor produced by the same brand.</p>
<p>But education still varies from teacher to teacher because we chose to
deliver lectures through individuals.. Ed therefore is still not a
product. It is treated as some sort of pre-modern craft. Just like
there was the shoemaker, ironsmith, bakery, there is.. the
teacher. Shoemaker works on his shoes, his product is as good as he
can make it, teacher same way. We modernized shoemaking, all kinds of
food prep but we only modernized <a href="../../2011/02/grading.md">some parts</a> of
ed, of the "craft", ending up with a bastardized, bizarre mixture of
modern and pre-modern. Grading is an industrial approach.</p>
