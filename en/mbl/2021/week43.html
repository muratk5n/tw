criminalizing investigative journalism itself. [.. DOJ] called this
the “New York Times problem,” because if WikiLeaks and Assange were
criminals for publishing classified information, the New York Times
would be just as guilty.</p>
<p>Five years later, in 2018, the Trump administration indicted Assange
anyway. But, rather than charging him with espionage for publishing
classified information, they charged him with conspiracy to commit a

previously  ~1000 W/m2 is widely known, sun at its zenith, an ideal

less direct sunlight, etc, you can probably arrive at the numbers
