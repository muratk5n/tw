<p>Europeans were saved the adverse effects of empires by being hard to
conquer in totality. This allowed a pluraslistic env to flourish.</p>
<hr />
<p>Most people do not realize but agricultural empires are highly
parasitic, the energy regime they construct are unstable because it is
unnatural. Their collapse is the natural event not the other way
around. See <a href="../../2020/07/the-emphatic-civilization-rifkin.html#rome">Rifkin</a></p>

<p>ISIS inspired NZ knife attack at a supermarket.. They had the guy

<hr />
<p>BBC: "Japan's [PM] has said he will not run for re-election as party leader
this month, signalling the end of his tenure...  The shock
announcement comes as Mr Suga's approval ratings dropped to an

now grappling with its worst ever Covid wave. The country, which has
now seen more than 1.5 million virus cases, has also seen a slow

<p>To recap: right now in Texas people CAN sue you for seeking abortion
services, but the state CANNOT ask you if you have a gun"</p>
<hr />
<p>Dems experience it, but the intra-party problem hit the Reps
too. Being more hierarchical, they had pols walk in a single-file on
ideology for a while, but now, they have a former President who said
stuff against forever wars, and a lot of muckers who still want to
invade countries, forever. How is there war and anti-war ideology in
the same right-wing party?</p>
<hr />
<p>In UK, Oz, and many other places, libs, and other major ideologies
have their own party. Not so in US which IMO increase intra-party
friction. Most of my related posts are US centric. Beware.</p>

<p>"Consumer prices in [DE] have been increasing for months, fueled by

<p>They need to include this 'energy' in hurricane reporting, as in how
much mass is moving when hurricane makes landfall. Kinetic energy is
$1/2 m v^2$, increase mass increase energy. Would one rather get hit
with baloon or a hammer at the same speed?</p>
<p>"Hurricane Katrina was a 'huge storm' with a 'very expansive' wind
field compared to an average storm.. Hurricane Ida strengthened
rapidly in the hours before it made landfall, whereas Katrina did the
opposite, strengthening to a Category 5 over the Gulf of
Mexico.. 'Hurricane Katrina.. was significantly larger, and had more
energy associated with it'"</p>

Saudi Arabia by arming Shia rebels in Yemen with over a thousand

<p>Lectures can be viewed at school just as easily as they are viewed at
home. The key is content, and who delivers it.</p>
<hr />
<p>If they want better education, they should ask for prerecorded lecture
videos of the experts to teach their children rather than a
parrot/doofus wildly gestulating (teacher)</p>
<hr />
<p>"Children going to school" isn't preferred bcz it is better for their
education. Parents need it because in a modern setting, school
functions as a day-care center, somewhere they can drop their children
off and go to work, whereever.</p>

<p>I'd seen J. Alexander before in a little show called Kyle XY..  She was

<p>At certain point one has to move on.. Society cannot keep having lockdowns.</p>
<p>NYT: "Britain is reporting more than 30,000 new coronavirus cases a
day, but the public seems to have moved on. Experts say this could be
a glimpse into the future for other countries... [A] professor.. 'It
looks like we’re just accepting it now — that this is the price of
freedom.'... 'It’s really difficult to ask people not to mix for a
prolonged period, especially if there is no solution.'...  [A]
specialist... 'All our Covid cases are unvaccinated by choice'"</p>

<p>Handing over Iraq support to France? They do have a strategic interest
there.. wanting to stop refugees. Also indirectly protecting
