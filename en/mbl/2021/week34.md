Wired: "Why I Flattened Three Afghan Villages.. When the day began for
Lt. Col. David Flynn on Oct. 6, Taliban insurgents were using three
southern Afghanistan hamlets as bomb factories. By the time the next
day ended, Tarok Kolache, Khosrow Sofla and Lower Babur had been
eradicated from the valley where they once stood"

Unless..  aliens love airbases

For significant states (higher sightings compared to population), we
calculate sightings midpoint, checked two, Idaho and Arizona, both
have airbases nearby. Weakens alien hypothesis somewhat

"Eat more plants: To reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and
diabetes, try to have every meal include at least one plant-based
dish. I typically have broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus or zucchini as
a side for lunch and dinner...

Avoid processed foods: Many products you find in grocery stores today
are loaded with salt, sugar, saturated fats and chemical
preservatives. A 2019 study of 20,000 men and women aged 21 to 90
found that a diet high in processed foods resulted in an 18% increased

If it is the latter obviously US is not going to 'reinvade' bcz of an
attack. But they can make WH look bad, trying to reinforce a "botched
pullout" narrative.

AFG attack: somebody is giving somebody a message.. About delaying the
final pullout date perhaps (tho US had already rejected that)? Or
war-hawk neocon tools stirring shit up? Through third-parties? Sad.

Insect protein? Have insects eat food waste (before it emits methane)
and then turn insects into flour, protein powder? Interesting. First
'insect protein' is bad marketing, they should be stressing this
flour, powder thing. Technically though it is cleaner to have plant,
lab-grown meat proteins, producing massive meal replacement powders,
which by definition, will have zero or no waste. Add water through
desalination (w better, cheaper approaches), through clean prenewable
energy, we are in the green.

---

It isnt like "US lost and others (in the region) won" due to the
pullout. AFG neighbor countries are worried.. I was watching troop
movements (through gdelt scans), almost all surrounding countries
deployed troops to their AFG border as pullout neared. Some countries
in the region are worried. US was providing a security service of
sorts to all neigboring countries there.

A main reason for the existence of these phony US ethnic subcultures is
so that 'earlier citizens' can play *Dances with Wolves* with their

Yes the Berlin Wall construction took place during [his watch](../../2021/08/nuclear-folly-plokhy.md.html#berlin).

So many screw ups during JFK's time.. Soviets built a wall on him in
Berlin.  His Sov counterpart was constantly on his ass bcz he was
inexperienced, came across a lightweight.

---

[Culture](../../0119/2014/06/the-culture-code.md) is received through osmosis
from the larger society around you, subconciously, before age 7. It is
not transmitted through education, ritual, or "stories". Most of the
subcultural identity assumptions are wrong. There are no "Polish",
"Italian" in US beyond the zeroth generation. There are no Turks in
Turkey.

Dude watches the moves of big dogs, true, their P/FCF ratios are fukked.

P/FCF = Market Cap / Free Cash Flow. It is a measure of whether market
cap is justified by the cash flow a company generates. Checking Shopify,
comparing against Microsoft, Google


```python
import yf
atts = ["Market Cap (intraday)","Free Cash Flow"]
yf.get_disp("SHOP",atts)
yf.get_disp("MSFT",atts)
yf.get_disp("GOOG",atts)
```

```text
SHOP ['Market Cap (intraday): 181.07B', "Free Cash Flow: ('506,972', '382,963', '8,218')"]
MSFT ['Market Cap (intraday): 2.29T', "Free Cash Flow: ('56,118,000', '56,118,000', '45,234,000')"]
GOOG ['Market Cap (intraday): 1.84T', "Free Cash Flow: ('58,536,000', '42,843,000', '30,972,000')"]
```

Ratios

```python
print ('SHOP %d' % ((181*1e9) / (506.0*1e6)))
print ('MSFT %d' % ((2.29*1e12) / (56.0*1e9)))
print ('GOOG %d' % ((1.84*1e12) / (58.0*1e9)))
```

```text
SHOP 357
MSFT 40
GOOG 31
```

Shopify cap is 357 TIMES of its (trailing twelve month) cash
flow. You'd have to wait >300 YEARS to reach the market valuation of
this company with the cash it generates.

In comparison MSFT, GOOG have lower P/FCF, can generate cash.

```python

yf.get_disp("AMZN",ds)
yf.get_disp("WMT",ds)
```

```text

Tony Blair talking shit?

---

Even if there is a single soldier there, that steals valuable
think-time IMO.. Now the country is an "open case", along with other
tasks, you have to worry about it, think about it, in military
terms.. I dont think central govs have that kind of attn, processing
time.. Now militarily they'll roll it up in a broad terrorism effort,
and the rest will be diplomacy, more comfortable ground for civilian
gov.

"By 2004... [UN rep] Brahimi had realised that keeping the Taliban out
of the Bonn process was a mistake. In an interview in 2004, he
described it as the ‘original sin’. Result: about 48 per cent Pashtun
got some 15 percent of share in power (this excluded Taliban and their
constituencies)...

This concept of centralisation and lopsided ethnic representation also
informed the formation of [the Afghan military].. Because the force
remained ethnically fragmented, no amount of training or equipment
could induce the overall, organic tribalism that informs successful
militaries"

Most CC today is badly designed but an ideal one (like a left-wing
version of Nano) cld be basis for a new econ. The world with such
change would be drastically different. How different is different? See
the monumental shift from agrarian to industrial England. If one lived
back then, there'd come a time, within a span of ~50 yrs, before /
after of the place would look completely different. Before would be
carriages, slow life, hand-sewn clothing, after, train, steam ships,
manufactured clothing, much faster life. Radical change. Day and
night. Oil and water.

How to know a solution is 3W? Does it fit under [these](../../0119/2011/04/fundamentals-of-industrial-ideologies.md) ?
If not, and new, 3W.

---

H2 fuel is that rare and ingenious solution.. It swaps one fuel for
another, so all kinds of distribution, central management,
concentration dynamics can apply as-is (along w people who make money
from it). At the same time, new fuels can support off-grid,
self-sustained living, see Lavo in Australia. Here renewable fuel
works for 3W.

---

Are renewable fuels a Second Wave or Third Wave development? They are
useful for both.

MSM delivers.. They arranged interviews with 30 officials.
