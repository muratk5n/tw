<p>Electricity tech pretty much sucks at everything except in certain
end-products which shaped the experience of an entire generation of
white-collor folk. They see lights go blink-blink and they get all
excited, and want to use that thing that makes things go blink-blink
for everything.. This is unrealistic.</p>
<hr />
<p>Electricity based heating is incredibly inefficient (surprise). </p>
<hr />
<p>If green heating takes priority two things need to happen; 1) encourage
production of small, portable, H2/NH3 heating units, provided cheaply to
the world (otherwise they'll just burn wood, coal). Lavo was
<a href="https://revolution-green.com/unsw-develop-hydrogen-storage-renewables/">already working</a>
on such a tech to power ovens (using a heat-exchange chemical reaction)
with simple H2 canisters. 2) For home heating, massive H2 pipeline
infra needs to be built which can provide homes
the fuel, they can use that for heating, through CHP.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fortescue is from AU which has plenty of renewable potential of its

everyone will try to grab opportunities from sunny countries; well
Fortescue is in there now, locking in commitments... Europeans are in
North Africa. Saudi Arabia is already working with Japan.</p>

<hr />
<p>"[4/2021] Ramped-up domestic production of green hydrogen and ammonia
makes perfect sense for South Korea. Last month a deal was signed
between Australia-based Origin Energy and steelmaker POSCO for the
supply of green hydrogen in the form of green ammonia, produced at
Origin’s to-be-developed, hydro-powered ammonia production facility in
Bell Bay, Tasmania. Although POSCO is aiming for the import of
zero-carbon feedstock to be only temporary, the sheer scale of their
goal to produce 5 million tonnes of clean hydrogen in South Korea by
2050 is readily apparent"</p>

<p>If co2 increases are during the winter, then priority should be to fix
heating, making that process renewable.. Surprise (!) H2, NH3 are the
best solutions for that as well. See CHP, Combined Heat and Power.</p>

<p>Renewable fuel pipelines wouldn't have this problem in case of
leak. No env damage (you'd be putting more H2 into H2O.. it's like,
who cares?).</p>

<p>Asking a socmed company to decide themselves to not make something go
viral.. that's like asking McDonalds to sell less burgers.. Tough
ask. Can they determine when something has high DMSI but "can be
dangerous"? The answer is no, because the AI tasked with that job
doesn't work (she said this many times, it's true, even a lot of weak
AI is extremely shoddy). Good testimony though.. there was lots of
useful info in it.</p>
<p>"During the hearing, [Facebook whistleblower] Haugen mentioned that
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to not remove downstream MSI, or
Meaningful Social Interactions, because, rumor has it, peoples'
bonuses were tied to it. Haugen was formerly a product manager on
Facebook's civic integrity team, which focused on election
issues. Facebook got rid of her team shortly before the Jan. 6 riots,
and she quit her job in April.</p>
<p>The downstream MSI is a problematic tool because it predicts when
something might go viral — get a lot of views, shares, and comments —
and then it pushes that content out to more users"</p>

<p>I have to say this is a fantastic application of mathematics to a
real-world problem. Based on two numbers the formula generates
near accurate counts for the entire grid structure. V cool.</p>
<hr />
<p>Poisson distr is,</p>
<p>$$ f(x) = P(X=x) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!} $$</p>
<p>which gives probability of 1 event, 2 events, in a certain block of
time. But in geo you have to think little differently. You divide
London into grids, and count how many bombs fell on each, then count
how many grids had 1 bomb, 2 bombs, etc. Reproducing such counts from
formula,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">N = 576.
m = 537/N
c = N*np.exp(-m)
expb = [c*1, c*m, c*m**2/2, c*(m**3)/(3*2)]
[np.round(e,2) for e in expb]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">Out[1]: [226.74, 211.39, 98.54, 30.62]
</code></pre>
<p>Real counts were 229, 211, 93, 35, etc. Pretty close. I am sure a
statistical test wld agree. Clustering disproved. </p>
<hr />
<p>Why the Poisson distribution usage in this <a href="../../2021/08/bermuda.html">post</a>?
Event counts tend to be distributed that way.. Let's take the London
bombing <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-actuaries/article/abs/an-application-of-the-poisson-distribution/F75111847FDA534103BD4941BD96A78E">example</a>.
They were wondering if bombings were clustering at specific places.
Cld be important.. Maybe Nazis were focusing bombing somewhere? Poisson
is for natural counts, then if that is proven, clustering is disproved.</p>
