<p>I hear some of this "keep it local" talk in left circles too
sometimes.. there the emphasis is in more "social", like they want to
"socially" talk about funding each streetlight, and "socially"
decide. In this case too, professional politician is better, at least
in our current modern setting</p>

<p>"The Short, Unhappy Life of a Libertarian Paradise.. <em>This American
Life</em> did a segment portraying Springs citizens as the ultimate
anti-tax zealots, willing to pay $125 in a new 'Adopt a Streetlight'
program to illuminate their own neighborhoods, but not willing to
spend the same to do so for the entire city. 'Ill take care of mine'
was the gist of what one council member heard from a resident when she
confronted him with this fact...</p>
<p>From disruption came, well, too much disruption. And from that came a
full-circle return to professional politicians. Including one.. who is
so persuasive he has gotten Colorado Springs residents to do something
the outside world assumed they were not capable of: Five years after
its moment in the spotlight, revenue is so high that the same voters
who refused to keep the lights on have overwhelmingly approved ballot
measures allowing the city to not only keep some of its extra tax
money, but impose new taxes as well"</p>

<p>Right; theoretically you need more money to cover a company's debt,

add the company's total long-term and short-term debt. Lastly,
subtract the company's cash and cash equivalents.. This result shows
how much money would be needed to buy an entire company. The
enterprise value calculates the theoretical takeover price one company
would need to pay to acquire another company."</p>

people". They are not 100% Irish, they are also 10%. This might bother
