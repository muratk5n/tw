<p>Carlson, <em>Ship of Fools</em>: "Chavez led the legendary Delano grape
strike, which lasted for five years and inspired college students
across the country to wear 'Boycott Grapes' pins.</p>
<p>Chavez’s signature rallying cry, 'Si, se puede!' ('Yes we can!'),
became so famous among well-educated liberals that Barack Obama used
it as a campaign slogan when he ran for president. Growing up in
California, I can’t remember a year when we didn’t celebrate the life
and achievements of Cesar Chavez in class.  Chavez’s name is still
everywhere in the state. There are six libraries, eleven parks, half a
dozen major roads, and at least twenty-five public schools in
California named after him, more than George Washington. That doesn’t
include the many Cesar Chavez academic buildings, student centers, and
at least one college. Cesar Chavez Day is a California state holiday.</p>
<p>Most enduring is Chavez’s 'Si, se puede!' Wherever left-wing
demonstrators gather, you’ll hear it. It’s most common at
pro-immigration rallies. Several times I’ve seen illegal aliens scream
it while carrying Mexican flags. Every time, I say a silent prayer of
thanks that Cesar Chavez is long dead. It would have been torture for
him.</p>
<p>Cesar Chavez didn’t support illegal aliens. Chavez didn’t like
immigration at all, generally, especially the low-skilled kind. Chavez
understood that new arrivals from poor countries will always work for
less than Americans"</p>

<p>The H2 power paste sounds like a fantastic innovation.. shows
potential rewards for betting on the right tech; if car company made
investm in fuel cells, they cld still get ROI from that after a new
delivery method is discovered. Power paste is just another way of
providing H2 gas into the FC, replacing H2 tanks, and everything else
stays the same. Indiv parts get innnovated on seperately = stronger
overall architecture.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology
and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have developed a paste for
hydrogen storage. The institute is calling the mass 'power paste'.</p>
<p>The researchers also claim their paste to offer high energy densities
and be suitable for all vehicles from electric scooters to
cars. According to Fraunhofer IFAM, the power paste, based on the
solid magnesium hydride, should allow hydrogen to be chemically stored
at room temperature and ambient pressure and rereleased as
required. Since the power paste only decomposes above about 250
degrees Celsius, this works without any issues even if, for example, a
scooter equipped with the paste is left in the summer sun for hours.</p>
<p>The storage paste’s starting material is only magnesium in powder
form, which is a very common element. At 350 degrees Celsius and five
to six times atmospheric pressure, this is reacted with hydrogen to
form magnesium hydride. The power paste is then produced with ester
and metal salt.</p>
<p><img width="340" src="twimg/EtrzYmdWYAASk1-.png"/></p>
<p>The power paste replaces the cylindrical pressure tank used in fuel
cell cars and buses. Therefore, the institute says that this solution
is suitable for hydrogen drives in smaller vehicles in cases where a
pressure tank would be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>According to the Fraunhofer researchers, the refuelling process is
straightforward. Instead of driving to a filling station, the scooter
driver changes a cartridge and fills tap water into a water tank. In
the vehicle itself, the paste is pressed out of the cartridge and
mixed with a precisely measured amount of water, depending on the
required power. This reaction produces gaseous hydrogen, which can
then be converted into electricity for the electric motor.</p>
<p>Only half of the hydrogen comes from the power paste, the other half
from the water in the reaction. 'The energy storage density of the
power paste is therefore enormous: it is much higher than that of a
700 bar pressure tank,' says Marcus Vogt, a scientist at Fraunhofer
IFAM. 'Compared to batteries, it even has ten times the energy storage
density.' The Fraunhofer scientists even say that the driver should
achieve a similar range with the power paste extrapolated to a car as
they would with the same amount of petrol, if not greater"</p>

<p><a href="../../0119/2011/10/phd-graduate-studies.html">Ph.D. is about depth</a>, not breadth.
The joke is "a PhD knows more and more about less and less until he
knows everything about nothing.". But then, there is something of
everything in that nothing :), so you'll have learned a lot, at the
very least develop brain muscles for that depth. It is also about
adding something new to world knowledge, not merely knowing more, its
not "undergrad times 10".</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Reality-Space-Time-Illusion/dp/B0849ZXQB1">The Mathematical Reality Why Space and Time are an Illusion</a>:
"As early as the 1930s, the Dutch physicist and close friend of
Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, wondered why the wave functions for matter
(complex numbers) and light (vector fields) were mathematically so
different. The importance of this profound question is still
underestimated today. If one follows the mission to explain natural
phenomena in a unified picture, light and matter must be contained in
a single formalism. This means that there has to be a mathematical
object that on the one hand, must be a little more complicated than
vectors and complex numbers, but on the other hand must incorporate
their properties...</p>
<p>Hamilton..  one of the most brilliant mathematicians of all time
.. started to study complex numbers. If it was possible to define a
multiplication in two dimensions in such an amazing way, was it also
possible in three dimensions?... On 16 October 1843, while walking
along the Royal Canal in Dublin, Hamilton finally came up with the
answer. In three dimensions it was indeed impossible; but at that
moment, he realized that the tricky multiplication of complex numbers
could be transferred to a four-dimensional number system called
quaternions that had three imaginary units $i$, $j$, $k$ instead of
just one $i$. Whether Hamilton could already have imagined the
fascinating rotations that occur in this number system, we do not
know. In any case, overjoyed at his idea, he carved the constituting
equations into a stone of a nearby bridge</p>
<p>$$
i^2 = k^2 = j^2 = i \cdot j \cdot k = -1
$$</p>
<p>... If we come back to the philosophical question of what mathematical
structure could potentially describe all physical phenomena,
quaternions are a strikingly simple possibility. Since they contain
both complex numbers and conventional vectors as a subset,
quaternions, in principle, can represent all the number systems
physicists have used in their description of the elementary phenomena
light and matter"</p>

<p>They used to say about Oliver Stone that in his movies, it's like "he
is standing by your ear with a megaphone and yelling at you what to
think". If those crits saw these bizarre Trek shows they'd never
complain about Oliver Stone ever again. In comparison OS is the
motherbleeping grand bleeping master of subtelty.</p>
<hr />
<p>The gentlest crit directed at such shows from our side has been "they
are not painting an optimistic future". I dont think that does justice
how badly these shows suck. The backdrop of <em>Firefly</em> was pretty drab
but everyone liked its characters, stories. No these weird shows lean
on an artificial message to insert agenda.</p>

<p>"The Silence of the Lambs becomes another bland procedural... <em>Clarice</em>'s
other co-creator is Alex Kurtzman, a practiced IP hack known for
Transformers, various Star Treks, a failed Mummy, and the worst
Spider-Man. That's a lot of money made off other people's
originality. Can't we institute some kind of limit on this stuff, like
maybe a person can only work in four pre-existing universes per
decade?"</p>

<p>Obviously ppl blame Renzi for crashing the coalition; but what did

<p>The deficit / thrift decision is a political one, so by definition it

a national / global fiat currency.</p>
