Why did Sharon pull out of Gaza unilaterally in 2005? The narrative at
the time was "yielding Gaza would help promote goodwill and peace".
But when did anyone leave territory without anything substantial in
return?

We also know Hamas is an [Israeli creation](../../2020/06/10-myths-israel.html#hamas).

Put the two together.. maybe Israel wanted that persistent flashpoint
to fight against, to keep the right mobilized, and militarized, and
always show the international crowd they are "under attack", so they
could continuously play the victim. It is unbelievable such a tiny ass
area can give Israel so much grief, to the extent ppl tremble behind
some "Iron Dome", hide in shelters everytime there are attacks.

With Trump exiting the "outsiders" wave took a hit.. That whole sales

issue that led to Gray's recall and his election), due to his ideology
apparently.. Well then how is that different from any other small-gov
anti-tax politician? Trump had some good but made bunch of
mistakes.. All in all, more experience is better.

I support recalling the recall law. 

"The recall election coming later this year for California Governor
Gavin Newsom doesn’t appear likely to end with his removal from
office. Although Newsom’s opponents have gathered enough signatures to
require a vote—and conditions in the state could still change—polls
show that public support for the effort is far below what Newsom’s
critics will need to force his removal.Nevertheless, the drive may
trigger another form of recall: It may finally prompt California to
examine whether the 110-year-old state law that governs recalls still
makes sense in our modern era of unrelenting partisan conflict. The
law was instituted during the Progressive era as a tool to tame
special interests, but the effort against Newsom suggests that it’s
become a weapon of harassment and manipulation by Republicans"

Jacobin: "[T]he reality is not all that complicated. Hamas's rockets
and Palestinians protesting, throwing rocks, or even rioting: these
are all desperate responses to sustained, systematic, and brutal
repression and land theft by Israel that has been going on for
decades, and has sharply escalated over the last decade in
particular. It is the 'language of the unheard', as Martin Luther King
called the African-American riots of the 1960s, which, like their
counterparts last year and in the decades between, are a similar howl
of frustration from those who have been relentlessly dispossessed and
brutalized with seemingly no recourse.

There are ways of putting an end to such things, whether rocket
attacks or property destruction from rioters. But to do that requires
first accurately describing the injustices that drive them"

What is being "commemorated" is always related to what the nation
wants to do in the future.. In that war Oz offered manpower due to its
[quid-pro-quo](../../0119/2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.html#australia) for
naval protection with the UK. That's how Oz soldiers ended up on the
other side of the planet. The same need exists today, albeit with a
different naval power, US, so the nation commemorates to keep that
memory fresh in case similar sacrifice might be needed in the future.

Because that would be a disincentive for EU members to stay / be in
the EU.  If they felt their pieces would just be taken in seperately
after membership, countries would have less of an incentive to be a

especially after a bad divorce like the one UK had, then EU could be
like "fine, come on in, in pieces, whatever".

"Why would EU care about pieces of countries joining to it, or not, like Catalonia?"

Wasnt until agro era to get spices in cooking..?  Foragers cld have
