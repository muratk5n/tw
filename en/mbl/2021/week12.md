Electricity is frequently misused. Elec is not suitable for power
transmission for instance, terribly inflexible in case of storage.. In

Quantitative history. Very awesome.

Some of the 9 variables in the data file: "Polity population
(`PolPop`), extent of polity territory (`PolTerr`), the size of the
largest urban center, `CapPop`. Infrastructure (`infrastr`) captures
the variety of observable structures and facilities that are involved
in the functioning of the polity. The variable `texts`, which scales
from 0 to 9, sums the number of securely attested types of texts (that
is, coded as 'present').  The idea here is that the more sophisticated
a society is informationally, the more different types of texts it
will have in circulation. economic development is reflected in
Monetary System (`money`). Presence of writing system is in `writing`"

"While the Wright brothers are credited with the first powered flight
of a heavier than air vehicle that could take off and land from level
ground, it was the German aviator, Otto Lilienthal, who first mastered
the aerodynamics of hang gliders. In fact, the experiments of
Lilienthal helped the Wright brothers a great deal in understanding
the basics of flight. Lilienthal himself built eighteen different hang
glider models over a period of five years and test flew them"

I agree. Spices are absolutely necessary to keep meat bacteria-free,
they are in fact healthy, not just tasty.


"Humans' use of antimicrobial spices developed in parallel with
food-spoilage microorganisms, Cornell University biologists have
demonstrated in a international survey of spice use in cooking... The
proximate reason for spice use obviously is to enhance food
palatability... But why do spices taste good? Traits that are
beneficial are transmitted both culturally and genetically, and that
includes taste receptors in our mouths and our taste for certain
flavors. People who enjoyed food with antibacterial spices probably
were healthier, especially in hot climates. They lived longer and left
more offspring. And they taught their offspring and others: 'This is
how to cook a mastodon.' We believe the ultimate reason for using
spices is to kill food-borne bacteria and fungi."

Using pre-recorded lectures will keep ed quality high. 

---

Record once, use everywhere. Govs can fund recording of such vids for
every subject, kids at school watch them over tablets. No more teachers
in the old sense of the word.

There will be "graders" not teachers in the new system. Grade is
pass/fail. Graders can hang around in study halls if they are not
grading (rare) both to keep it quite, and answer the occas questions
in their field.

---

I like this lecture format. You see the lecturer, and the equations
simply appear while he talks, parts gets highlighted for emphasis, and
necessary pieces get carried over to the next slide if
necessary. 3Blue1Brown style, which is all animation and lecturer
voice, is fine too but this one has more of a lecture feel to it.

China’s use of ... disinformation, economic threats, covert foreign
interference etc. — is and will remain the day to day reality of
international affairs in our region. It’s not the product of a
mishandled China relationship; it is the way Beijing seeks to advance
its interests against countries, like Australia, that do not comply
with its preferences and are active in defending their own.

Calculating distance ratios for Moon and the Sun, ancient times.

Dude waited until it was half moon, then he knows Earth-Moon-Sun are
at right angle (light has to hit perfectly from one side for that half
shadow to happen),

Then he estimates angle $\varphi$, around 87 deg (point to one, then
swing arm to the other, angle covered is $\varphi$). Now u got your
right angle triangle, rest is basic trig, reverse of cos,
$1/\cos(\varphi)$

```python
"%0.2f" % (1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)))
```

Out[1]: '19.11'
```

The sun is roughly 19 times further than the Moon.

I dont like ragging on govs on vaccs, I know many are doing their
best. But IMO we are stuck with some sucky infra, this cant be the
setup we meet the next pandemic with.
