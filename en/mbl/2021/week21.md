"[F]or a time, Kushner and his conciliatory views toward China seemed
to have won out. After Trump's inauguration .., Kushner was the
official who had the direct line to Beijing, so he had the most
influence. He was listening to Henry Kissinger, Mnuchin, Cohn, and the
billionaires, all of whom steered him toward a friendly relationship
managed at the very top of both governments"

China lovin Kusshhhhh 

"It soon became clear to the [China] hawks that Kushner’s instincts
led him to agree more with the finance executives and billionaires he
had known his whole life"

"Mnuchin, the former investment banker and movie producer, became the
head of the Treasury Department and the lead official for dealing with
Beijing on trade negotiations, along with Lighthizer. He also played a
complex and covert game pushing back against the China hawks inside
the system for years, defending the interests of his Wall Street
associates and, some would say, the pro-China lobby in Washington"

\#rogin

"During the campaign, dozens of GOP foreign policy establishment
figures signed public letters condemning Trump's candidacy. Those who
didn't sign such letters were privately pressured not to join Trump's
movement. That's why Trump had to rely on amateurs and unknown
outsiders like George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and J. D. Gordon to
staff him on foreign policy during the campaign. They weren't Russian
assets. They were fringe players in the GOP foreign policy scene who
loved the idea of a huge payoff from a longshot bet on a kooky
candidate"

GDP Per Capita fell for TR dramatically since 2013. Probably coincides
with degradation of its democracy (dem goes, innovative people
leave). WB API doesnt have numbers for 2020, but most state it did not
get better. Some estimates even place the current number to be around
$7000. Sad.

Newton didn't have any deeper insight into why the laws are the way
they are. He tried bunch of stuff, certain formulas worked better (on
data) than others. That's it. With what we know now, with more
experimental data, and other areas of sci, you could surely modify
Newton.

"How is it possible to modify Newton's theories?"

---

Go for it. Dont worry if it has mismatches with early universe
theories.  Scientists have no idea what the f--k is going on there

"Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a hypothesis that proposes a
modification of Newton's laws to account for observed properties of
galaxies. It is an alternative to the hypothesis of dark matter in
terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently
understood laws of physics"

That number is global estimation of all reserves, currently used or
not. So this Nevada place did not expand the total, it is within the

for green energy consumption. There, they found some new in Nevada"

analysis, this work could have produced SARS-CoV-2 or a proximal

"In discussions of climate emergency, degrowth has always been the
elephant in the room; acknowledged from time to time, but rarely
spoken about. But it may be the only solution..

To address this omission, researchers .. recently published an array
of degrowth pathways.. These show that an intentional reduction in
economic output is actually less risky than a combination of continued
GDP growth and geo-engineering. In advanced economies, degrowth would
involve a slowdown in manufacturing, accompanied by a significant
switch to green technologies and far greater focus on environmental
and ecological protection and repair.

If managed effectively, there would be no need for productivity to
fall, nor for people to become worse off. Embracing both a universal
basic income and a four-day working week would make the transition
relatively painless. Of course, a new smartphone model every year
would be out of the question, but would we really miss it?"

Bcz due to loss of GDP, "growth"? Two ways to increase GDP, either
through more ppl, eg immigration, 2% more ppl 2% more growth which is
"dumb growth". Or you produce more per person, GDP Per Capita
increases, even w same amount of people (or a few skilled immigrants),
GDP increases, through knowhow = good growth.

No growth is also an option.
