Al Dork got his ass kicked in Florida (2000) thanks to Nader because

Dems cant propose new legislation for fear of SCOTUS reversal? Well,

The Intercept: "By 2013, the Obama administration had concluded that
it could not charge WikiLeaks or Julian Assange with crimes related to
publishing classified documents — documents that showed, among other
things, evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan — without
criminalizing investigative journalism itself. [.. DOJ] called this
the “New York Times problem,” because if WikiLeaks and Assange were
criminals for publishing classified information, the New York Times
would be just as guilty.

Five years later, in 2018, the Trump administration indicted Assange
anyway. But, rather than charging him with espionage for publishing
classified information, they charged him with conspiracy to commit a
computer crime..

The alleged hacking not only didn’t happen, according to expert
testimony, but it also couldn’t have happened"

The map shared [before](../2022/twimg/FCtre5sWEAgFFp9.png)
says sunlight radiation at maximum is ~300 W/m2. The number we used
previously  ~1000 W/m2 is widely known, sun at its zenith, an ideal
situation. For daily calculations you factor in sun availability,
less direct sunlight, etc, you can probably arrive at the numbers
seen in that map. For more accurate, region specific calculations
that need a simple, daily number, I'd go with the numbers there.

If carbon pricing can be made to work, how about "material usage

TDB: "It has been a summer of scrutiny for the ultra-rich—and now the
billionaires are fighting amongst themselves. The culprit: a so-called
'Billionaire Income Tax', that Democrats in Congress are reportedly
mulling to help finance Biden’s agenda. The proposal would only target
several hundred of the wealthiest Americans by taxing the rising
values of certain assets, like stocks, even before they are sold...

wealth, and then they take loans against that to live on. And that's
tax free. And I think it’s bullshit' [.. one] said"

for heating (by "eco-friendly" they mean that carbon neutralness
again, but it is still harmful). I bet stuff like this contributes a
lot to the CO2 uptick during the winters. Lay in the pipe for these
places for renewable gas, or send canisters, make'm cheap, done.

Report shows 90% carbon capture rates both for coal and natgas.

In 2019, EU's gross electricity production was 2904 TWh. In output
capacity terms,

```python
"%d GW" % (2904000 / 365.0 / 24)
```

```text
Out[1]: '331 GW'
```

The planned H2 capacity compares well with the number above.. The plan
will likely encourage others to jump in, it wld be great to equal that
331 GW.

AP: "The phrase 'Let’s go Brandon' refers to a meme that emerged
earlier this month from a video of an interview with NASCAR driver

A reporter said on air that fans behind him were chanting 'Let’s go
Brandon,' when video footage indicates the actual chant was 'F--- Joe
Biden.' Some people have suggested the reporter purposefully
misinterpreted the crowd’s chant and the quote has become a
catchphrase among critics of Biden"

Because battery charging is slow, they need to apply too much power,
to recharge faster. That will overburden the grid, also degrade the
battery. Finally ka-boom!

National Geographic: "At high charging speeds lithium batteries can
overheat, causing them to degrade over time.. [N]ot only can that
drastically reduce the battery’s capacity... dendrites can grow across
the electrolyte, touch the cathode and create a short circuit, causing
the battery to catch fire or explode"
