<p>Earth being a shithole in The Expanse is a bit of a stretch. They have
UBI, an atmosphere, can grow stuff and by then god knows what. So
they'd still be 1000 times better off than any comparable nearby
planet, rock. Even if underwater u'd sooner develop gills to adapt to
that than the bone structure to live on Mars.</p>
<p>Still, good story telling, great show</p>

<p>While in US back in the day when I noticed odd BMI, I researched
little and came upon Montignac, the French diatician. His method
worked brilliantly; he wrote abt same issues that are mainstream
now. I helped a few coworkers lose weight through this method too..</p>
<hr />
<p>What were the highlights from the DW documentary on junk food?</p>
<p>Michelle Obama had a genuine effort started to decrease childhood
obesity, but it was hijacked by corps and the message was diverted
into exercise (Raj Patel has some colorful comments here), fun and
dancing were emphasized and it was swarmed by showbiz people. That
switch wld not help, as u need better eating than exercise.</p>
<p>I now have this nagging feeling that the big exercise movements of
80/90s were a result of misplaced hope, or straight up media
manipulation. People were gradually getting worse but did not know
why, they shld have been led towards better eating, but the message
was corrupted, diverted to exercise. More muscles, more running etc.</p>
<p>How it started: During 70s the silent killer was heart attack. It was
determined "fat" was the culprit, so the fight was on. Fat had to be
removed. But when food producers took the fat out they replaced it
with something worse.. sugar. Fat alone cannot cause excessive weight
gain, sugar has to act as catalyst.</p>
<p>Producer of "sugared drinks" which essentially what Coca Cola is, had
a field day. Through globalization they also reached broader
markets. Through NAFTA for example they had freer access to Mexico and
coupled with other "invasions" the Mexican diet worsened, became more
artificial and sweeter, the effects were immediate, they became less
healthier, fatter. Two NGO lawyers recently fought to add a tax on
sugared food and drinks, they won; afterwards obesity decreased
substantially.</p>

<p>"Eating onions, cabbage, beetroot and cherries meant 19th century
people were healthier than we are today. [They] were healthier and had
stronger immune systems than us... Also ate wholemeal bread which
contained immune-boosting yeast. Avoided sugar, cigarettes, drank weak
alcohol and did strenuous exercise. They ate onions, watercress,
cabbage, beetroot, Jerusalem artichokes, apples.</p>
<p>You could get a huge bunch of watercress for next to nothing - there
were watercress trains that came into the cities. Cherries were known
as a poor man’s fruit. A punnet of cherries, that you would pay £6 for
in Marks and Spencer's these days, you could get then for a ha'penny
[a coin the equivalent to half a penny]. They ate scraps of meat from
the bone, boiling the bones to get all the nutrients. And fish like
herring, mackerel and cod roes"</p>

<p>Their Rome collapsed first, so they had the experience of the absence
of a centralized power for longer, had a period of diverse
city-states, and there were always other small to medium states near
in Europe, which creates a certain pluralistic environment. They had a
major part in Renaissance, most of that stuff is internalized. That's

<p>The parts that make up these Frankensteins are also broken beyond
repair, e.g. TR nationalism is bizarrely fallacious. The locals of
Anatolia owe next to nothing to "the steppes", neither in genetics,
nor in culture (every migrant was assimilated into the region, and the
gov culture was Roman -so again local-). How my people manage to move
an inch is beyond me, but then again, they really aren't.</p>
<hr />
<p>Which and how the ideological parts get included can be completely
arbitrary, the mix is all in the mind of the fascist.</p>
<p>The leaders of these parties, coalitions are effective schizophrenics,
mental patients of DID (dissociative identity disorder). This is not
surprising bcz the poor asshole has to maintain all that crud in a
singular head. So one day he'll talk about his "pure race from the
steppes of Central Asia", the next socialism-level state intervention,
the one after that neoliberal market action. The followers clap
nevertheless, too braindead to realize something is off, but sadly for
the country, its media also suffer from the same condition who
mistake this show for politics.</p>
<hr />
<p>TR lives in a seperate plane of existence, as such naturally shows how
not to do something, anything.. Its parties, coalitions are cesspools
of proto-fascim, bunch of stuff thrown in some container <em>beforehand</em>,
from get-go, either after coups, or in "parties" that live in the
aftermath of those coups. Take 4 views, throw them in, done. Of course
it is impossible to maintain incompatibilities for an extended period
of time, that's where fascism comes in.</p>
<p>A by-product of the approach is whatever the mix happens to be,
anything that is left out, is immediately deligitimized. This can be
the left, sometimes the right (and almost always Kurds), but there is
always the legitimate mix and "others".</p>
<p>"How do things work in TR?"</p>
<hr />

latest polls?"</p>
<p>"If u can keep it" is part retort</p>
<p><img width="340" src="twimg/EsQRs0hXEAMmvmH.jpg"/></p>
<hr />
<p>The emergent, self-organized blocks of ideologies, as clusters, carry
within a good signal, if enough though leaders coalesced around
something, chances are there is an approach that needs representing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Do coalitions.. But between ideologically distinct parties. If that is
in place, fine, obviously some coalitions will be able to deliver more
than others, but at least seperate parties decide how that coalition
is formed, on their own terms.</p>
<p>"If not unifying, then should people not do coalitions?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Modernity = Industrial System = Second Wave. It is about
standardization, centralization, maximization, etc which forms the
superstructure, but underneath that some countries managed to supplant
it with a proper representative democracy. Not suprisingly they are
better off than others.</p>

<p>An earlier <a href="../../0119/2014/02/is-earth-fked.md">post</a> on BW</p>
<p>"[A] geophysicist, Brad Werner, who in 2012 argued ... that we are in
this [climate] mess not because the market system is not working well
enough but because it is working too well. Werner’s startling
presentation to the annual conference of the American Geophysical
Union was titled ‘Is the Earth F--ked?’ and he posed in public the
question climate scientists and others who follow their work had been
asking in private... [He builds] on the fact that humans now
constitute a force of nature so powerful that we have caused the Earth
to enter a new geological epoch ... [We created] globally integrated
market system of resource-use and waste generation driven by the
relentless need to grow...</p>
<p>The essential problem, Werner argued, is that there is a mismatch
between the short time-scales of markets, and the political systems
tied to them, and the much longer time-scales that the Earth system
needs to accommodate human activity, including soaking up our carbon
dioxide and other wastes.</p>
<p>Technological progress and globalization of finance, transport and
communications have oiled the wheels of the human components of the
planetary system allowing it to speed up. But the pace of the natural
system carries on as it always has. The problem is not .. market
failure but market success"</p>

<p>Maybe they already know they are getting their "gray" energy from
Russia, with CCS done on their side</p>
<p>US has potential for both (but dont frack, or transmit NG over pipes,
they leak, very hard to regulate, Id also watch for <a href="../../0119/2019/09/sf6.md">this shit</a>,
the material is used in wind turbines and high-voltage electric installations)</p>
<p>"How is Europe more gung-ho on green energy production compared to
other countries?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Dubya used that stuff so well.. I'll never forget during one debate
Gore was constantly saying "I'll fight for this","I'll fight for that"
W jumps in and he's like "there's been enough fightin". Boom. With a
Southerner, cowboy delivery, good timing.. Gore was floored. Absolute
top notch salesmanship.</p>
<hr />
<p>But the most obnoxious form of unity talk starts from the Washington
Consensus, post-politics mentality that emerged, a Frankenstein of the
post Berlin Wall, TINA world order. After the whole damn Berlin Wall
collapsed on their heads, Dems in abject fear started running around,
looked for a new place to go, lurched right, tried to outdo Reps in
their own game. Reps balked, and radicalized on 4G (Green, Gays, Guns,
God) to differentiate, so the Clinton years had insane amt of
drama. These issues were moral, ethical issues not political,
unresolvable, so intense fighting persisted, became
entrenched. Hannity vs Maddow, people screaming at eachother,
theather, junk-food politics are all the descendants of that era.</p>
<p>Now into this environment, in the eleventh inning steps in a certain
politican and asks for, you guessed it, unity, comity. It can sell..
"Im a uniter not a divider" etc. But thinking of the causes, for the
Dems especially, we know they r in no position to seek unity, their
leaving a major ideology unattended for years, and trying to displace
another is what caused the shitstorm to begin with, not to mention
Trump's rise.</p>
<p>Then what are we left with? A spin, on top of a big mistake, on top of
a generational shift -now defunct-... Meh. </p>

<p>Sometimes the use of the word is tactical, you mention unity, if the
other guy does not go for it, now he is the asshole. Small effect, but
maybe worth a try for some.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is used bcz pol has no inclination to deliver anyway, you
ask for unity, you dont get it, than you immediately blame the other
side as a cover for you not doing anything.</p>
<p>There cld be some old cultural aspects involved; we talked abt during
<a href="../../0119/2018/09/pemmican.md">Pemmican Wars</a> Brits had to step in and <em>merge</em>
two companies. If such things happened more than once, maybe it became
"the legitimate thing", "the grown up thing" in the eyes of the US
political class, persisted in its DNA, at the very least, as a
lip-service, verbally.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some reasons unity, or "going bi" is eluded to so much in
US politics.</p>
<p>During a pandemic, after Trump, and in a country composed of states,
it is not that off-kilter to pay some lip service to the concept. Of
course the unity of states doesnt imply political unity, but hey, it
rhymes, good TV. It's a feel-good word, like marshmallows, chicken
soup, Sunday morning.. School is out. Whatever...</p>
<hr />
<p>Not bad... If there is less corp pandering, more left from AC, the bro
at CNN can be the new Fredo.</p>
<p>"Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that leading alternative
energy technology provider Plug Power Inc. will establish a $125
million Innovation Center in New York State creating 377 new jobs. The
center, located in the Town of Henrietta, Monroe County, will be the
first world's first Gigafactory for Proton Exchange Membrane
technology. The company will use this facility to manufacture hydrogen
fuel cell stacks and electrolyzers"</p>

<p>I spoke with Rep. Rashida Tlaib about why she's leading the opposition
against calls for a massive expansion of the security state in
reaction to the Capitol attack. She said eroding civil liberties is
not the answer to holding the rioters accountable.</p>
