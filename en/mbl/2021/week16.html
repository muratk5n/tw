<p>"One country that has already seen significant growth in fuel cell
usage is South Korea. <em>Power</em> [magazine] reported on three new
electricity generating facilities based on fuel cell technology that
were deployed in South Korea last summer: a 50-MW power plant placed
in ...  Seosan, a 19.8-MW installation in Hwasung, and an 8.1-MW
facility in Paju. 'Part of the magic that we’re seeing in Korea as it
relates to stationary power using fuel cells is incentives,' said Joe
Cargnelli, director of engineering for Cummins’ Fuel Cell and Hydrogen
Technologies division. “What Korea has done is they’ve created
essentially the feed-in tariff for fuel cells—for stationary fuel
cells. So, if you think back to how solar energy and wind energy got
started back in the mid-90s, it was through a solar feed-in tariff and
a wind tariff, and it started in Germany and kind of caught on, and
that’s what sort of gave solar and wind their start. Korea has done
that for fuel cells and stationary power. So, they have incentives
that promote the deployment of stationary fuel cells and [they’ve
been] highly successful, and I think it’s a great strategy.'"</p>

<p>No wonder, under the crust there is magma, at 1000° C degrees, only
the Sun itself is hotter (5000° C). Hell the inner Earth core is as
hot as the Sun! So theoretically it is unlimited energy. Challanges
are drilling, finding pockets close enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Geothermal power has considerable potential for growth. The amount of
heat within 10 000 metres of the earth's surface is estimated to
contain 50 000 times more energy than all oil and gas resources
worldwide (Shere, 2013). Moreover, there is a strong economic case for
the deployment of geothermal energy"</p>

<p>Both Coinbase and DFinity are backed by a16z oddly enough</p>
<hr />
<p>Market did right on this one, Coinbase offers services for many
different cryptos, it's not tied down to any single shitcoin.</p>

<p>Ethereum DApps arguably offers distributed apps but their platform
emerged out of another (badly designed) crypto. Its founder is not an
system architecture guy.. I remember hearing performance issues a
while back. Better to start clean slate for distributed apps, then
plop on there whatever apps 1 might like or need.</p>
<hr />
<p>Crypto mining is there to encourage people to share their computing
resources with the network right? First of all, Nano proved you can
have a crypto without mining, but, let's say u need computing
resources for additional services. Then, wouldnt a computing
environment that promises constant availability of such resources, and
offers them peer-to-peer, be a better fit for a crypto? I am thinking
of DFinity Internet Computer right now.. A crypto would be just
another app on such a platform. There will be chat app, social net
app, and crypto app.</p>

<p>If more work was offloaded to other kinds of social workers, than
there'd be less need for police, than less funds for them; ergo it'd
be <em>defunding the police</em>. Notice this is not the same as saying "f..k
the police", merely reducing the need for the police.</p>

<p>"@theappeal</p>
<p>A new study suggests large chunks of police work can be safely
transitioned to non-police public safety workers: Across five cities,
between 23 and 45 percent of 911 calls were for issues like noise
complaints, disorderly conduct, and wellness checks"</p>
