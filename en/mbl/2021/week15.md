CJR: "As discussions on how to help save local news continue, new
bills and ideas have come to the fore. Independent newspapers are
coalescing around the Local Journalism Sustainability Act which
proposes direct subsidies (in the form of tax credits) for news
subscribers, local journalists and small business advertisers. Sweden
has a similar news subsidy system.

Large media outlets are backing the Journalism Competition and
Preservation Act which will allow outlets to band together to
negotiate with Google and Facebook. In some ways this is like
Australia’s recent News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory
Bargaining Code"

This is fun.. research by GDELT.. The dataset surely contains more

Interesting.. for March 3rd, GDELT found [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20210307004657/http://www.ukrweekly.com/uwwp/ukraine-receives-additional-u-s-security-aid-while-biden-and-eu-prolong-russia-sanctions/)
and wrongly classified it as military escalation..
It is more like "cage rattling" I'd say.

---

GDELT uses news web pages as raw source, applies natural lang
processing algos on them to extract Actor1-Action-Actor2 type "events"
for ex "Thailand warned South Africa", where diplomatic "warn" is the
action.. There are mistakes sometimes. I had to go through every
result one by one to filter out such false positives.

I looked at GDELT [event files](http://data.gdeltproject.org/events/),
going back go March 1st; did not find any initial Ukraine
movement. The first time any build-up is reported in the region, in
the 1/3-1/4 timeframe, was April 1, by RUS. One of the news links
parsed by GDELT is [here](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/top-us-general-calls-russia-ukraine-amid-reported-moscow-troop-buildup/).

Beckley: "Historically, when fast-growing great powers slow down, they
do not mellow out. Instead, they become more repressive at home and
aggressive abroad. They crack down on domestic dissent and expand
overseas to find new sources of wealth, rally citizens around the
ruling regime, and deter foreign rivals from exploiting their economic
problems. China is already on this path—as its growth slows, it is
repressing freedom in the mainland and in Hong Kong, ramping up
pressure on Taiwan, colonizing the South China Sea, building the
largest navy in the world, and buying assets and building ports all
over the world"
