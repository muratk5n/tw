Assange is an Oz citizen. This is their deputy PM talking.

"'Assange was not in breach of any Australian laws at the time of his
actions. Assange was not in the US when the event being deliberated in
a court now in London occurred,' Mr Joyce wrote... 'The question is
then: Why is he to be extradited to the US? If he insulted the Koran,
would he be extradited to Saudi Arabia?'"

Corporations know that full well of course; they sponsor and help
spread the "liberty-centric" message to avoid regulation, increased
taxes (as they were hit with in Mexico) or outright bans.

Some cried foul when authorities (as in NYC muni) tried to clamp down
on sugar, in soda, in foods, etc, labeling it "government intrusion
into daily lives". Many forget preferring sugar over fat, than
creating an env for "exercise nuts" when it didnt work was part of a
misplaced wave that happened (created) outside them as well, outside
the control of regular people. They, their parents followed that dumb
ass shit and ended up here. Now they should not pull out the
"intrusion" argument in the 11th hour when some are trying to fix the
problem for them. Many seem to forget they live in a modern world,
where concentrated, centralized forces roam.

Major job losses wout AGI is possible. 

TDB: "This Is the Robotic Hand That Could Finally Take Over Your
Job.. [O]ne of the most difficult human parts to mechanically
replicate is the hand. The human hand can accomplish a nearly endless
amount of tasks—not just because of how versatile our hands and
fingers are, but also because we can intuitively determine how much
force to apply. It’s incredibly challenging, for instance, to teach a
robot how to hold an egg with two fingers firmly without crushing the
shell. A team of South Korean scientists may have just solved this
problem—and perhaps opened the door to robots finally taking over our
jobs"

Note the image of a rich person 200 yrs ago was someone fat (bcz sugar
was rare only the rich could afford it). Now the image of a rich
person is lanky, bcz the wealthy have access to better cooking,
ingredients (through chefs etc), read: less starch, more vegs. The
issue never was the amount eaten, or how much fat.

At the same time typical poor person now is likely to be fat; sugar
and starch has become so prevalent in the market that it is now
feeding (and killing) the poor.

---

But sugar, starch is bad

That thing has nearly the capacity of the Nordstream 2 pipeline which
is built to supply *a country*. Imagine 10, 20 of such plants.. How
can that not solve our energy problem? For far-flung shipments,
generate ammonia. Or H2, pipe it to whereever. CSP already can work at
night bcz it utilizes heat which can be stored in molten salt nearby
temporarily.  Winning tech.

*Finch* is supposed to take place in 2030 -- 9 years away.. And the
roboticist guy had strong AI tech? Sci wouldn't have advanced that
far.. not with the current neural, "deep" approaches. He'd have the
dog and some bizarre chatbot that spits out random facts from
Encyclopedia Brittanica. I'd rather have all published novels be read
aloud to me through Text-to-Speech, or have re-runs of MASH.

But imo the ideology, its first inception, quickly [fell out of
favor](../../2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.html#estagfurullah),
stayed that way until well into the 20th century when Kemal and his
cohorts utilized, resurrected the same escapist fantasy to handle a
similar trauma. The empire was gone, and the new nation needed
something "different". The founders served up the nomadic Turk from
faraway lands, just like Nazis had dreamt up the Aryan from Atlantis.

---

The claim is the Otto itself started the Turkist ideology partially in
the 15th century, before the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal. Otto had its ass
kicked back then by Temarlane from Central Asia, so historians
(propagandists) were attempting to say "yeah we are kinda like that
guy, we are from that region too".

Energy *can* become a non-issue. Absolutely. Yes we can.

H2 View: "Hydrogen has always been the answer to our energy
needs. However, the configuration of global politics post WW1, which
was won by oil and coal supremacy, was always going to be a tough nut
to crack...

With hydrogen, we can now take energy “off the table” as a source of
so many historic ills, and we can do it far more rapidly than has been
suggested"

H2 View: "Australia has started trials for a hydrogen *Guarantee of
Origin* scheme that aims to add value for all types of hydrogen with

sector and has now been recognised as a ‘world leader’ in hydrogen
technologies in the State of Hydrogen report...

This expansion of the hydrogen sector will continue to expand with the
Government launching significant funding opportunities for the sector
[as seen in] the $464m Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs programme that
has already seen benefits with hubs being announced across the nation"

Never Tango with an Eskimo. That was a song.

I see.. Iglos have good insulation, the rest is body heat. They are

---

How do the Eskimo get heating..?

---

Yep. Confirms an earlier obs, this fact jumps out at you looking at
the emission graph. Heating is the worst polluter, first bcz of its
energy requirements (which are not 100% green) and through unorthodox
methods of generating heat IMO in the developing world.. I cant blame
them, the alternative wld be freezing to death.

US EPA: "Recent data suggest that space heating accounts for about 42
percent of energy use in U.S. residences and about 36 percent of
energy use in U.S. commercial buildings"
