<hr />
<p>Laws in physical sciences are mathematical, the best ones are usually
incredibly compact, intelligeble, in continuous form. In order to
compute them the formulas are 'discretized' (a whole branch of sci
itself), approximation is introduced, checked against data.</p>
<p>In ML, or so-called "AI", things work the other way around; they start
with approximation, computation first, and... stay there. They don't
have a formula for their domain. There is no mathematical model of
thought.. all they have is bunch of 'patterns' captured from raw data
in an unintelligeble format.</p>
<p>If anyone thinks one can reach human level AI from this, I have a
bridge to sell them.</p>

without much calculation. Likewise, because the rejectors are spread
out in line, it's just a matter of timing to pick the right one to

<p>What food was foreign to (most) hunter-gatherers? Tomatoes. For many
in the "Old World", until 16th century there were no tomatoes. The veg
is associated with Italian cooking, but this is a mistake, a recent
development... They, nor or the Greeks, or anyone wld have known it
before 16th.. So if you dont like tomatoes, do not feel
bad. Biologically we did not need it, not part of our evolution, so
can safely be eliminated from diets.</p>
