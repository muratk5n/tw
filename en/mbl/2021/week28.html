<hr />
<p>Eriksson, <em>Computational Differential Equations</em>: "Mathematical
modeling has two basic dual aspects: one symbolic and the other
constructive-numerical, which reflect the duality between the infinite
and the finite, or the continuum and the discrete... However,
beginning with the search for rigor in the foundations of calculus in
the 19th century, a split between the symbolic and constructive
aspects gradually developed. The split accelerated with the invention
of the electronic computer in the 1940s, after which the constructive
aspects were pursued in the new fields of numerical analysis and
computing sciences, primarily developed outside departments of
mathematics. The unfortunate result today is that symbolic mathematics
and constructive-numerical mathematics by and large are separate
disciplines and are rarely taught together. Typically, a student first
meets calculus restricted to its symbolic form and then much later, in
a different context, is confronted with the computational side. This
state of affairs lacks a sound scientific motivation and causes severe
difficulties in courses in physics, mechanics and applied sciences
building on mathematical modeling"</p>
