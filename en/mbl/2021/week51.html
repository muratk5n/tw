importantly, gasification systems produce hydrogen as a fuel gas,
which can be purified and used in a low carbon economy where hydrogen

found it impossible to believe that this pseudo-scientific point of

<p>True. Exp growth depends on the existing population size. X number of

use exponential to subtitute a mathy-sounding word instead of more

simple increase. The TV show <em>Numb3rs</em> had the best line, "not
'exponential', just 'more'".</p>
