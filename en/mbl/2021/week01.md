slightly different tune... I need that hipster peppy, young scientist

"Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton,
director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama,
president of Harvard, and Chief Economist at the World Bank, wrote a
post-Christmas editorial for Bloomberg entitled, 'Trump’s $2000
Stimulus Checks are a Big Mistake.' It’s a classic"

That will of course mean less f-ing Clinton people around, like Summers

Latest inequality, Gini [calculations](../../2021/01/stats.html#gini) with the latest data

```
2020-04-01    0.463
2020-07-01    0.460
```

There was slight decrease in the last quarter. Let's hope the trend
continues, the Dem Prez reduces it faster, at the very least the
damage done during Clinton years are reversed.

"The data .. suggest [tax avoidance banning] efforts have been mostly
unsuccessful. The share of US firms’ profits booked in low-tax locales
keeps growing year after year ... The evidence is less comprehensive
for non-US multinationals because the available data cover fewer
years, but the trend seems to be the same. How can we explain this
lack of success? The BEPS initiative does not attack the heart of the
tax-dodging reactor. Firms are still supposed to exchange goods,
services, and assets internally. The Big Four still manufacture
transactions that have no market price. Transfer pricing accountants
still have incentives to please their clients and certify as correct
whatever arrangement will minimize their tax bill. In need of a
Copernican revolution, we’ve been busy refining the Ptolemaic model of
the heavens"

"[T]he New Deal [is] perhaps the most progressive in world history. As
we saw, it successfully taxed the wealthy for more than three
decades—not only on paper, but in actual fact. By design, few people
paid the 80%–90% top marginal income tax rates that prevailed from the
1930s through to the 1970s. But, all taxes included, effective tax
rates for the very affluent exceeded 50%. Tax dodging was kept in
check. ...[FDR] also spent time explaining why taxes mattered,
appealing to morality, and shunning tax dodgers. 'Mr. Justice Holmes
said, "Taxes are what we pay for civilized society" [the words
inscribed above the entrance to the headquarters of the Internal
Revenue Service in Washington, DC]. Too many individuals, however,
want the civilization at a discount.'"

\#TriumphOfInjustice \#Zucman

"As Roosevelt’s message to Congress expresses clearly, the
quasi-confiscatory top marginal income tax rates championed by the
United States were designed to reduce inequality, not to collect
revenue. Why would anyone try to earn more than a million dollars if
all of that extra income went to the IRS? No employment contract with
a salary above a million would ever be signed. Nobody would amass
enough wealth to receive more than a million in annual capital
income. The rich would stop saving after they reached that point. They
most likely would give their assets to heirs or charities once they
surpassed the threshold"

"Dfinity is building what it calls the internet computer, a
decentralized technology spread across a network of independent data
centers that allows software to run anywhere on the internet rather
than in server farms that are increasingly controlled by large firms,

releasing its software to third-party developers, who it hopes will
start making the internet computer’s killer apps. It is planning a
public release later this year.

Rewinding the internet is not about nostalgia. The dominance of a few

the way we communicate ... There are few places online beyond the
reach of these tech giants, and few apps or services that thrive

Uncle Don acted like corporatist sadly. In near past. But we got to

"The US corporate tax rate was slashed from 35% to 21%. The
consequence? Federal corporate tax revenues have fallen by almost half
from 2017 to 2018.13 We’ll return at length to this development, but
it’s worth recording here its most direct implication: low corporate
taxes mean the ultra-rich, whose income mostly derives from owning

Oh no, not Uncle Joe

It's a new age now, of course, we all hope for the best, prep 4 the

"[Reagan] had made overhauling taxation with dramatically lower tax
rates the top domestic priority of his second term. On that 22nd of
October 1986, about to sign into law the Tax Reform Act, he had reason
to be joyful. Starting on January 1, 1988, the country that had
pioneered the quasi-confiscatory taxation of high incomes would apply
the lowest top marginal income tax rate in the industrial world:
28%. After three weeks of floor debates, the tax bill had passed
ninety-seven to three in the Senate. Democrats Ted Kennedy, Al Gore,
John Kerry, and Joe Biden all had enthusiastically voted 'Yes.' ... To
this day, and although it is now widely recognized as one of the key
contributors to the explosion of inequality, the bill is still fondly
remembered by all those involved in its crafting"

"A fear haunted the slaveholders of the South: that non-slaveholding
majorities would use taxation to undermine—and eventually abolish—the
'peculiar institution.' They particularly feared wealth taxation: at a
time when 40% of the population in Southern states was considered
property, property taxes were an existential threat for slaveholding
planters. They fought such taxes tirelessly, and for two centuries
wielded their power to keep taxes and public institutions
archaic. How? By stifling democracy"

"It’s always possible to shrug off the risk of an entrenched
plutocracy.  To believe that whether a few super-rich own a large
fraction of the country’s wealth is irrelevant. That America’s
institutions are so strong that they cannot be captured by special
interests. That from Boston to Los Angeles, democracy will always and
forever beat plutocracy. And certainly, democracy has overcome
plutocracy in the past. It triumphed over the slaveholding plutocracy
of the South. It beat back the nascent industrialist plutocracy of the
Gilded Age"

"The second and primary culprit for the high tax rates paid by
working-class Americans is consumption taxes. The United States may
not have a value-added tax, but it has a proliferation of sales and
excise taxes that, like a VAT, make prices higher. And there's a
twist: in contrast to regular value-added taxes, US levies exempt most
services, which the affluent consume at high rates as a percentage of
their overall spending. This twist means that the consumption of the
poor (goods) is taxed, while that of the rich (services) is largely
exempted. The United States does not have a VAT; it has a poor man's
VAT.

Do you enjoy going to the opera? No sales tax. Have a country club
membership? No sales tax. Need a lawyer? No sales tax. But if you
drive, dress, or buy appliances, sales taxes apply all the way"

"Under business as usual, income concentration is likely to keep
rising in the medium run thanks to a snowball effect: the wealthy save
a higher fraction of their income than the rest of the population,
which allows them to accumulate more wealth, which in turn generates
additional income. For most of the twentieth century, progressive
taxation and especially high tax rates on capital (as opposed to
labor) had kept this spiral under control. But the tax changes of the
last two decades have dismantled this safeguard"

"But you can’t do research at a startup (I have the scars from

processing doesnt care about that. The visualizer would care, that
code when it renders "the world" looks at that property, and draws
them 2 km apart. But this doesnt change the fact that in my code I can
go from Alice to Bob in one hop (just follow pointer, O(1)). The speed
of light, concepts like close, far is for the renderer... Space is
emergent for the gamer, dude who plays.

If The Programmer is good (which "He" probably is) he would seperate
the backg logic from his UI anyway. Whapush 😉

AFAIK time is unidirectional (no going back) and exists simply due to
entropy which always increases (Hawking's *A Brief History of
Time*). LS calls time essential, space is emergent. Events, relations,
a graph of them, is real. We sense this structure as space in our
minds (emergent). Future does not exist. There is one specific
history.

---

LS: "The lesson I draw from these theories [like Barbour's] is that to
extend quantum mechanics to a theory of the whole universe, we have to
choose between space and time.  Only one can be fundamental. If we
insist on being realists about space—as Barbour and Gomes do—then time
and causation are illusions, emergent only at the level of a coarse
approximation to the true timeless description. Or we can choose to be
realists about time and causation. Then, like Rovelli, we have to
believe that space is an illusion.

There is much more that could be said about these recent non-realist
and magical-realist perspectives. But the bottom line is that if your
interest is pragmatic, and you want to use quantum theory to
understand questions other than those arising from quantum
foundations, any of these will serve to frame your calculations and
the explanations you draw from them. But if you want to solve the
measurement problem in a way that gives a detailed description of what
goes on in an individual physical process, nothing but a realist
description will do"

Heard about Barbour from @skdh vid, one Barbour lec touches on
Leibniz, relations. Sounded like Lee Smolin, and indeed there is ref
to Barb in *Einstein's Unfinihed Revolution*. He took some ideas from B

Critics are short-changing *Kong: Skull Island*. We can't expect to see
an exact remake of the original King Kong everytime. They got a fem
lead kinda looking like Jessica Lange but not exactly the same? WTH?

This movie is about war mongering. Better mov also IMO. The humans go
to an island accompanied by a military escort who is headed by a
colonel unhappy the Vietnam War ended (1973). He carries the war with
him to the island. Roles reversed now, the big ape is defending (kinda
like the Vietnamese were defending their home turf?), where the humans
are invading. And the enemy this time was something far worse.

It is subjectively important bcz ppl subjectively do "emotional accounting" at year level.. and since many ppl do it, tho subjective it may be, it makes the turn of the year objectively important.

But I appreciate the subversion of expectations, the quicky-contra 😉

Then if Senate leadership is not codified in law, I guess party
discipline is playing a role in keeping everyone in line? People
follow the precedent (and the leader) bcz they dont want to incur the
party's wrath. But the leader also has to watch his coalition, he
couldn't just willy nilly do stuff, bring anything for a vote.. He
himself is also elected by his party members.

"Under the rules, all senators are essentially equal. That is, no
senator is more powerful than another. However, the majority leader is
clearly considered to be the most powerful senator today. This
perception is based on his ability to make motions to proceed to
legislation and nominations and to fill the so-called amendment tree
(i.e. offer the maximum allowable number of amendments to legislation
to block senators from offering their own amendments). Both are based
on his ability to be recognized first by the Senate’s Presiding
Officer. But the leader’s preferential recognition and, by extension,
his ability to make motions to proceed to bills and nominees and his
ability to fill the amendment tree, are grounded only in
precedent. And the leader’s power in these areas is perpetuated simply
by senators’ continued deference to the majority leader to wield them
however he chooses"

Trade if you must, buy if you need, but nothing beats highly localized
networks which have dense interlocking know-how. This is why advanced
countries are advanced. Pfizer/BioNTech develops drug with
cooperation, but they are at the center of that cooperation and their
chief scis are based in Germany. The cooperation part is secondary,
and moot.

Of course they are. Both are major exporters.

He is powerful bcz other Senators defer to him. This power doesnt seem to be based on anything legally binding.
