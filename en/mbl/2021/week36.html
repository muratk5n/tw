<p>Storyline preference becomes clear around the issue of identity. They
usually portray AI as a unique, non-copyable thing... When it is
sent somewhere it ceases to exist at the source. Why? That's not how
software works!</p>
<hr />
<p>The reason AI come alive story is used more in movies these days is
not bcz Holywood necessarily knows what the phuck is going on on the
tech side.. They are basically repurposing the Pinoccio story for a
new domain. The "inanimate object coming alive" angle.. that's
all. Pinoccio for the good side, Frankenstein for the bad. Old story
adapted to something new, wout any change in semantics.</p>

<p>NYT: "Other People’s Rotten Jobs Are Bad for Them. And for You.. When
truck drivers are underpaid and overworked, it’s bad for them and also
bad for us.Researchers have found interesting connections between poor
working conditions and seemingly unrelated social problems. For
example, most people don’t think of the opioids crisis as a
labor-related issue, but research has shown a connection between
occupations with high workplace injury rates, like construction, and
opioid overdose fatalities. (People get injured on the job; lacking
sick days, they take opioids so they can work through the pain.)"</p>

<p>CCS isn't only about pulling carbon from the atmosphere. It can be
applied to any fossil product during refinery, before anything leaves
the plant.</p>
<hr />
<p>What is the underlying technological assumption though? If you burn
fossil like today, sure its bad. But convert to renewable fuel at the
source through ccs, not so bad. Tech assumptions cannot solely be
based on pedestrian views of office-dwelling, white-collar,

<p>Texas is clamping down, right across the border, Mexico is easing
up. If women are denied service, they'll go right across the border to

to fight faux-politics through culture war. So in a way it is smart,

<p>The beef with the oppo towards left parties, e.g. Die Linke isn't
based one issue or another. It is the general stance towards
them.. They say 'see these people over there, they are <em>beyond the

for cutting taxes in the middle of a crisis, but left cannot talk
about two-tier system in healthcare. That makes you some kind of
weirdo..</p>

<p>EIA: "Producing and burning ethanol results in emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. However, the combustion of ethanol
made from biomass (such as corn and sugarcane) is considered
atmospheric carbon neutral because as the biomass grows, it absorbs
CO2, which may offset the CO2 produced when the ethanol is burned"</p>
