<p>"The Dfinity Foundation today announced the commercial launch of the
Internet Computer. It has an ambitious goal: to become humanity’s
primary compute platform for building the software—including
decentralized versions of Linkedin, TikTok, and WhatsApp—that will
change the way the world works.</p>
<p>After five years in development, and a $102 million raise from
investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, the
much-anticipated project is finally launching, alongside a utility
token, ICP—which will list directly on Coinbase, and an intriguing new
identity solution"</p>

<p>Democratic process would take care of the differing viewpoints; but
the state's official ideology is what these morons mumble, so they
linger, and once in a while get to be part of coalitions which is a
problem. The state needs to stop picking sides, correct its narrative,
the democratic process would take care of the rest.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are TR parties who stress the nat identity more, yes.</p>
<p>But this identity is supposedly shared by everyone, why are there
parties stressing it? Notice not talking about conservatism, nor
defending cultural values per se. These parties are about a particular
wording. Why? Well the reason is that the label, and its underlying
narrative is bunk. It has little relation to the culture it supposedly
'labels'. With so much abject stupidity naturally there are
disagreements, and viewpoints around the label, which should be above
politics, and some of those viewpoints on the pro side form parties.</p>

<p>I am wary of these pricing, offseting schemes myself.. See vid

better. Renewable fuel comes out of producers, then the rest is

<p>MB: "During his first two terms, more than 1,800 of Putin’s decrees
were ignored or circumvented, and Putin himself estimates that only
about 20 percent of his decisions get implemented unless he intervenes
forcefully. The former president, Dmitri Medvedev, has stated:
'Without exaggeration, Russia is a country of legal nihilism. . . . No
other European country can boast of such a level of disregard for
law.' Rigorous studies corroborate this claim: nearly 30 percent of
Russians admit to breaking the law on a regular basis, and Russian
police earn more money from second jobs (roughly 40 percent of which
involves illegal activity) than from their offi cial salaries"</p>
<hr />
<p>Aha turns out Rodrigues, of the Rodrigues formula fame was French.</p>
<hr />
<p>MB: "France has banned fracking entirely, partly because its best
shale field lies directly under Paris"</p>
<hr />
<p>Another (easier) way to fix the problem wld be to remove the problem
itself -- the teacher. </p>
<hr />
<p>MB: "[C]ross-national data suggest that the American system of teacher
recruitment, training, and accountability has been put together
backward: it draws teachers from the bottom half of college classes;
gives them minimal training; and when teachers fail to improve student
perfor- mance, the government imposes rigid standards, hoping to do on
the back end what it failed to create on the front end. By contrast,
countries with top PISA scores, such as Japan, Singapore, and Finland,
do the opposite: they select teachers from the top third of college
classes, train them rigorously, and then give them the freedom and
time to hone their skills and share best practices with other
teachers. As Harvard’s Jal Mehta has shown, such methods largely
obviate the need for external accountability, because 'selection and
preparation on the front end makes extensive monitoring on the back
end unnecessary.'"</p>
<hr />
<p>MB has critism for US too when it is called for</p>
<p>Beckley: "Other worrying trends include the fact that the U.S. startup
rate (the share of new firms in the total number) has declined by 50
percent since 1978, and business deaths now outnumber business births
for the first time in generations. American corporate profits are at
all-time highs, but two thirds of U.S. economic sectors have become
more concentrated among a handful of mega firms, a fact that suggests
that rent seeking and price gouging, rather than innovation, caused
the rise in profits. For example, the four airlines that now control
80 percent of the U.S. commercial airline market (compared to 48
percent a decade ago) have profited immensely in recent years by
cramming more passengers onto planes without reducing ticket prices"</p>
<hr />
<p>Beckley, <em>Unrivaled</em>: "The U.S. military ... can sink Chinese ships
and submarines virtually anywhere in East Asia. The main reason is
that the United States has dozens of missile-armed submarines that are
almost invulnerable to China’s notoriously weak antisubmarine
capabilities. In wartime, U.S. submarines, with the aid of America’s
vast undersea surveillance network in East Asia, could set up picket
lines near the combat theater, or near China’s ports, and sink China’s
ships and submarines with torpedoes, missiles, and mines.  According
to estimates by the RAND Corporation, in a PLA invasion of Taiwan,
eight U.S. submarines could destroy almost 40 percent of China’s
amphibious ships as they attempt to cross the Taiwan Strait while
losing perhaps one submarine. The same study estimates that in a
conflict in the South China Sea—where the sea is deeper and provides
U.S. submarines with better acoustics and more room to operate, and
where most of the PLA’s meager antisubmarine warfare forces cannot
reach—U.S. submarines could destroy Chinese ships at almost no risk of
being attacked themselves"</p>

<p>CH acting up..? Id be wary of the military position.. </p>

<p>Yes and the solution wasnt a 'global approach'. Global pharma had to
be bslapped, its patents open-sourced. Global travel had to be
curtailed early, and fast.</p>

<p>The Guardian: "[NZ] prime minister has been coming under pressure from
allies to take a tougher approach towards country’s largest trading
partner. New Zealand’s differences with China are becoming “harder to
reconcile,” the prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said... Ardern’s
comments were made as New Zealand’s government comes under increasing
pressure, both internally and from international allies, to take a
firmer stance on concerns over human rights abuses of Uyghur people in
China’s Xinjiang province. Last week, the Act party presented a motion
for New Zealand’s parliament to debate whether the treatment of
Uyghurs in Xinjiang constitutes genocide"</p>

ways"</p>

<p>Culture is not something that is "declared", and "assumed". It is
burned in the brain through the culture around you, through osmosis at
around age 7. First generation children of immig parents are getting
the culture of their lands burned in their brains, not their
parents'. So that weirdo fuck who came in with his bags, chicken coops
and shit who talks to you with an accent -your parents- are as foreign
to you as they are to their country. That is how people who arrive
into area / cultures become part of those areas / cultures.</p>
