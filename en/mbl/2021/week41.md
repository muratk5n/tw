France nuke move makes sense for them.. H2 can be the clean, optimal

Most in the developed world discount the heating issue; for many it is
'just there'; it works, out sight out of mind. But this is the \#1
pollutant in all consumption for the world. Heating is deadly
serious.

zero.. That's why heating is key for us, we are constantly hovering

"The American Revolution created the Columbus most of us over the age

modern-day mainland United States. Yet when the need to develop a
national history with no discernible connection to Britain arose
during the Revolution, early Americans seized upon him"

Not surprising at all; UK cons are eating into low-income votes, so
taking votes from Labor, but then losing to Lib Dems for the same

needs representation, right?

This tech can form the basis of a portable, plug-and-play heating

Lavo: "BBQ functions in a unique manner by relying on heat exchange
technology, a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to create
heat and disperse it to the hotplate. This solution delivers a

Celsius"

The gateway drug into the corrupt liberterian circles funded by Thiel

Green groups naturally object. The plant in q is one of the biggest
polluters in UK.

Here's a way to look at it; Carbon was taken off the air, why put it
back in?

"[P]lans are being pioneered by [UK] Drax Group, which claims that
burning wood pellets is carbon-neutral because trees absorb as much
carbon dioxide when they grow as they emit when they are
burnt. Capturing the carbon emissions from biomass power plants would
then effectively create 'negative carbon emissions', according to
Drax"

Platinum used in fuel-cells are highly recyclable (same report) plus

After Azeris took Karabakh region w TR help, Iranians suspected Israel,
and US motives behind it. Then TR-Paki-Azeri joint military drill
happened, then the Azeri tax on the Iranian trucks passing through
Karabakh. That road was apparenly a major trade route for the
Iranians, which the Azeris captured. Then Iran did exercise near AZ.

The situation can escalate to a proxy war, involving all the parties
listed. Maybe the war would be preferred by the US planners, Iran gave
US a hard time in Iraq, this wld be the payback, possibly leading to
toppling of Iranian regime, and completing the bigger plan triggered
by the invasion of Iraq. Dont care abt the f-ing mullahs but cld be
problematic for my tigger. Homie can barely take care itself as
it is.

"Iran’s military has launched a large military drill near the country’s
border with Azerbaijan, in a show of force amid tensions with its
neighbouring country partly linked to the latter’s close ties with
Israel...

Iran is also concerned about the presence of fighters that Azerbaijan
brought in during last year’s fighting over the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh.

Tensions between the two neighbours also rose after Azerbaijan imposed
a 'road tax' on Iranian trucks moving through the Karabakh region, and
detained two Iranian lorry drivers last month"

FDP could be considered Germany's liberterians. Their positions are,
no surprise, liberty-centric.. In US though, a lot of "free-market
leaning purists", especially the ones visible in the media (thanks to
that shady Thiel money) approach the issue differently. They must be
there to help the single-party rule to persist by providing
semi-intellectual cover for the culture war.
