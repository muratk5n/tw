IMO Singapore is looking to become a major H2 exporter itself. The H2
deals it makes are way more than its own needs.. It is looking to pull
as much to it as possible create the flow, then when this thing goes
through the roof (and it will) Singapore will be ready.

That's not how it works.. One general approach, the one that is

(5%), and nuclear power (4%)"

US, UK, China, Russians.. historically they pumped the most carbon
into atmo, so they are responsible for global warming.

Any green tech invented in these countries need to be shared with the
rest of the world due to this offence. US polluted over 30 TIMES more
compared to Indonesia. Top 10 polluters are responsible for 70% of all
cumulative carbon pollution since the 18th century.

Don't get me started on natural gas, fracking and 'flaring'.

the future of U.S. troops [in Iraq]. As of today, there are roughly
2,500 U.S. troops deployed to Iraq — down from nearly 6,000 in 2016.

In reality, however, the U.S. military is spending about as much
time ducking rocket fire from an alphabet soup of Shia militias. The
attacks on Iraqi military bases and airports that house U.S. personnel
or contractors have gotten so frequent that a week free of rocket fire
is almost considered an abnormality.

According to a count by the AFP news agency, around 30 rocket, mortar,
or bomb attacks on U.S.-linked facilities and coalition troop convoys
have occurred since President Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20"

Eriksson, *Computational Differential Equations*: "Mathematical
modeling has two basic dual aspects: one symbolic and the other
constructive-numerical, which reflect the duality between the infinite
and the finite, or the continuum and the discrete... However,
beginning with the search for rigor in the foundations of calculus in
the 19th century, a split between the symbolic and constructive
aspects gradually developed. The split accelerated with the invention
of the electronic computer in the 1940s, after which the constructive
aspects were pursued in the new fields of numerical analysis and
computing sciences, primarily developed outside departments of
mathematics. The unfortunate result today is that symbolic mathematics
and constructive-numerical mathematics by and large are separate
disciplines and are rarely taught together. Typically, a student first
meets calculus restricted to its symbolic form and then much later, in
a different context, is confronted with the computational side. This
state of affairs lacks a sound scientific motivation and causes severe
difficulties in courses in physics, mechanics and applied sciences
building on mathematical modeling"

EL VOTO CASTIGO

"Approved by the Clinton Administration's Justice Department, the raid
on April 22, 2000, to take custody of Elián González was emotional and
dramatic—and so was its impact on Cuban-American voters. In the view
of Miami-based pollster Sergio Bendixen, 'It was humiliating to
Cuban-Americans, and the 2000 election was payback.' They called it
*el voto castigo*, or 'the punishment vote.' Whom did Cuban-American
voters punish? Democratic nominee Al Gore and his fellow Democrats"

"By late April, more than 80% of the world’s COVID-19 vaccines had
gone to people in wealthy countries, with just 0.3% to people in
low-income countries... Currently, older and medically vulnerable
individuals are dying from COVID-19 disproportionately in poor
countries, while young, healthy individuals are getting vaccinated in
wealthy ones...

What may be most pernicious about the COVAX scheme, however, is that
rich countries and their pharmaceutical companies have repeatedly used
it as a shield to deflect demands for IP waivers... Over 50 years ago,
Kwame Nkrumah observed how aid is a ‘revolving credit’ which returns
to countries of the global North in the form of increased profits. [To
a certain extent] COVAX is being leveraged to protect corporate
patents and profits..

[A solution is] focused on pooling, temporary waivers, or suspension
of IP"

Up until 2020 BTI data confirms a [decline](../../0119/2015/09/the-logic-of-political-survival-mesquita-code.html#btiall)

democracy,' said a recent report from the V-Dem Institute, a
Sweden-based research center. 'The world is still more democratic than
it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but the global decline in liberal
democracy has been steep during the past 10 years.'"

"New Theory of Flight.. The new theory of drag and lift of a wing is
fundamentally different from the textbook theory.. [The old]
Prandtl-Kutta-Zhukovsky theory which was developed shortly after
powered flight was shown to be possible by the Wright brothers in
1903, breaking the perceived mathematical impossibility of powered
flight based on Newton’s incorrect theory of lift from air hitting the
wing from below. We find that the textbook theory of flight attributed
to Prandtl-Kutta-Zhukovsky is incorrect, since it is based on
phenomena which are not carried by solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations"

Another pollution related scandal in Germany? Unbelievable. Of course
VW is involved.

"According to a story in Forbes this week, the fact that German
authorities have been looking into the auto industry’s business
dealing has caused industry leaders to engage in a mad-dash to be the
first whistleblower... Indeed, it looks like Daimler grabbed the
golden ring, which could save it billions, while Volkswagen, which
thought it had won the honors, came in second and BMW is a distant
third. Under European Union law, the first one to become a
whistleblower usually comes away with little more than a slap on the
wrist .. while number three pays the bulk, in this case, BMW"
