<p>30s nationalism was beaten through war in Europe. TR branch wiggled
its way out of that loss.. They hid in the cracks of the society,
occasionally getting out and messing shit up. Zionists were already
well protected behind their shield of victimization, they could not be
criticized for anything, in fear of being called anti-Semite. That is
at least two countries today who harbor a rotten form of nationalism,
a kind that long should have been swept away.</p>

rules-based order,' wording that echoed NATO’s communiqué. Hours later
[.. CH] conducted their own show of force over waters south of Taiwan,
the island democracy that China claims as its own. Only days before,

<hr />
<p>Data can be noisy or missing (report delays, etc); so you try to piece
it together from clues. An aircraft carrier (code CVN) never travels
alone, it is accompanied by destroyers (code DG), and guided missile
cruisers (code CG). So CG and DG presence can indicate a larger deployment.</p>

<p>Presence around South China Sea is more visible, on both ends, near
Japan, and Vietnam / Singapore.</p>
