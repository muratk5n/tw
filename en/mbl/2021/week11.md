US support for China since the 70s might have another logic in it 🤔
besides containing Russia. Lets say u are US, and want to be included
in a region. Which country would you support in that region?  Answer:
the one that is surrounded by 19 countries who are hostile to it. Then
once that country gets stronger, everyone in the region will freak
out, and call the superpower for help (as they should). 

CH doesnt have to play this game. Work on your pluralism,
democracy.

"If Penthouse suddenly switched all of its glossy double-page spreads
to abs and cocks, you’d expect some backlash. A few awkward
silences. Probably a sharp drop in subscriptions.

Does this make its readers a pack of bigots, misandrists, and
man-hating homophobes burdened by fragile sexuality? No. They were
simply looking for something else. The magazine’s target audience has
an established sexual preference, confirming the old adage ‘sex
sells!’ is as true for Penthouse as it is for a fifty-year-old science
fiction show.

Doctor Who is the James Bond of the geek world – men want to be him,
and girls want to shag him. I can’t speak for the boys, but who
doesn’t want a gorgeous, older boyfriend with a time machine, infinite
bank balance, no job, endless adventure, and a demi-god status in the
universe? He is an inconvenient sexual fantasy that contradicts the
preferred social politics of the BBC, despite being its flagship show.

It is no accident that ratings soared when Scottish heart-throb David
Tennant took over the role in 2005 alongside his young, attractive
female companion Billie Piper. Their will-they, won’t-they romantic
tragedy elevated the BBC production out of the fringe geek world and
into the mainstream market of swooning teenagers.... 

2018 saw the progressive agenda inside the BBC hit peak woke –
cannibalising their golden goose. The desire to promote inclusivity
with casting choices, led new showrunner Chris Chibnall to hire Jodie
Whittaker as the first female Doctor. Token casting is normally fatal
but identifying as a taxpayer parasite makes it impossible for the BBC
to ‘go broke’ like its corporate peers. This artificial survival
allowed us to watch the gender-bender experiment play out to hilarious
disparities between glowing critical reviews and god-awful audience
scores that were so bad BBC management kept deleting them"

Beckley: "The U.S. military ... can sink Chinese ships and submarines
virtually anywhere in East Asia. The main reason is that the United
States has dozens of missile-armed submarines that are almost
invulnerable to China’s notoriously weak antisubmarine
capabilities. In wartime, U.S. submarines, with the aid of America’s
vast undersea surveillance network in East Asia, could set up picket
lines near the combat theater, or near China’s ports, and sink China’s
ships and submarines with torpedoes, missiles, and mines"

---

Beckley: "Taiwan retains enduring advantages that could make the island
virtually unconquerable—provided that Taipei and Washington capitalize
on them. Armadas of the kind China would need to invade or blockade
Taiwan are extremely vulnerable to modern missiles and
mines. Meanwhile, the Taiwan Strait is perilous—typhoons and 20-foot
waves are common most of the year—and Taiwan itself is a natural
fortress. Its east coast consists of steep cliffs, and its west coast
is dominated by mud flats that extend miles out to sea and are
buffeted by severe tides. As a result, there are only a dozen beaches
on Taiwan where an invading force could even land.

Taiwan’s defenders also have history on their side. No blockade in the
past 200 years has coerced a country into surrendering its
sovereignty, and there has been only one successful amphibious
invasion of a developed nation in modern history (the Allied invasion
of Italy in 1943). All other successful amphibious assaults were
against overstretched forces defending hastily dug positions on
foreign or contested territory with small arms. If China invaded
Taiwan today, it would be attacking massed forces defending fortified
positions on home soil with precision-guided munitions"
