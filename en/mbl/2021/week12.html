<p>I agree. Spices are absolutely necessary to keep meat bacteria-free,
they are in fact healthy, not just tasty.</p>
<p>"Humans' use of antimicrobial spices developed in parallel with
food-spoilage microorganisms, Cornell University biologists have
demonstrated in a international survey of spice use in cooking... The
proximate reason for spice use obviously is to enhance food
palatability... But why do spices taste good? Traits that are
beneficial are transmitted both culturally and genetically, and that
includes taste receptors in our mouths and our taste for certain
flavors. People who enjoyed food with antibacterial spices probably
were healthier, especially in hot climates. They lived longer and left
more offspring. And they taught their offspring and others: 'This is
how to cook a mastodon.' We believe the ultimate reason for using
spices is to kill food-borne bacteria and fungi."</p>

<p>Sure the Sun is hotter than lava, but not a million times hotter. It's
only five times hotter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Easy to intuit the Sun is liquid. What is the hottest natural thing we
know on Earth? It is lava. And lava is liquid, it flows. We know
this. So why do some so readily accept the gaseous hyphothsis?</p>

<p>Lesson here for all teachers, dont dumb stuff down for shinier
delivery. Your jobs is to <em>demystify</em>, not creating a new level of
mystery around your character, your props, or whatever.</p>

<p>Carl Sagan had an <a href="https://youtu.be/G8cbIWMv0rI?t=333">eduvid</a> on that
too. Not bad, but lemme tell u what you did wrong here Carl, forgot to
mention how stick angle translates to btw-city angle..</p>
<p>He is really rockin that brown jacket with the turtleneck tho. Very
disco, Studio 54, I dig it, but some stuff got lost during "the show".</p>
<hr />
<p>Extend rays like below, implies angle between two cities is 7.2
relative to Earth center</p>
<p><img width="340" src="twimg/ExBij1KXMAA5ekf.jpg"/></p>
<p>Btw city angle is 7.2 out of 360 deg. He had a guy walk btw cities,
dist 5000 stadia = 800 km. Using angle ratio equalness to
circumference / city dist ratio,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print ('%0.0f km' % (360/7.2 * 800))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">40000 km
</code></pre>
<p>This guy found a good approx for Earth circumference with f-ing
sticks, shadows, simple angle measurement, plus indirectly
debunked flat Earth hypo. Ella re malaka</p>
<hr />
<p>Library as in the freaking Library of Alexandria</p>
<hr />
<p>First approx calculation of Earth circumference, BC 200s. Oh
yeah. Erotosthenes (scientists, head librarian) heard from someone,
during summer solst., stick in Syene has no shadow, at noon. He tried
it in Alexandria (little north) saw shadow. Measured angle, 7.2
degrees,</p>

<p>What wld someone's first impression of Anthony Hopkins be? Classically
trained actor, has that posh accent, probably watches those artsy
movies all the time.. But the guy isnt like that.. He likes action. He
watches Schwarzenegger movies. He said so in an interview. So u
thought something abt the guy, but he was something else. He clearly
likes the genre, he keeps playing roles in them! </p>

<p>Calculating distance ratios for Moon and the Sun, ancient times.</p>
<p>Dude waited until it was half moon, then he knows Earth-Moon-Sun are
at right angle (light has to hit perfectly from one side for that half
shadow to happen),</p>
<p><img width="340" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png"/></p>
<p>Then he estimates angle $\varphi$, around 87 deg (point to one, then
swing arm to the other, angle covered is $\varphi$). Now u got your
right angle triangle, rest is basic trig, reverse of cos,
$1/\cos(\varphi)$</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;%0.2f&quot; % (1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)))
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">Out[1]: '19.11'
</code></pre>
<p>The sun is roughly 19 times further than the Moon.</p>

<p>I dont like ragging on govs on vaccs, I know many are doing their
best. But IMO we are stuck with some sucky infra, this cant be the
setup we meet the next pandemic with.</p>
