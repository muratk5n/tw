"In a White House ... Press Call a Biden administration official
admitted that the CIA and other parts of the U.S. intelligence
apparatus were involved in assisting the 'War on Corruption' which
jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and elected Jair
Bolsonaro...

In July 2017 .. Kenneth A. Blanco gave a speech at NATO think tank the
Atlantic Council in which he bragged of FBI personnel informally
involved in Brazilian anti-corruption operation Lava Jato and its
prosecution of former president Lula. FBI personnel involved later
boasted that it had 'toppled presidents'. Lava Jato prosecutor Deltan
Dellagnol described Lula’s 2018 arrest which kept him out of the
election he was on course to win, as “a gift from the CIA“. The judge
who prosecuted Lula, Sergio Moro, became Bolsonaro’s Justice Minister,
and both made an unprecedented visit to CIA headquarters in Langley
within months of taking office. Lava Jato’s origins can be traced back
to 2008/09, where Moro and a blueprint for an operation of its type
appear in State Department cables"
