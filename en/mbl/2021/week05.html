<p>The author's description "junta giveth, junta taketh away democracy"
is spot on.</p>
<p>"The 2008 [Burma] constitution – adopted after a referendum described
as an 'insult' by international rights groups – was a military venture
that instituted a form of tutelage democracy with the military playing
national caretaker. The 213-page document includes several articles
enshrining the military’s 'right to take over and exercise state
sovereign power' in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>Monday’s scrapping of the constitution was, in effect, constitutional"</p>

<hr />
<p>"Award-winning UK scientist Dr. Lui Terry discusses how his pioneering
work on nanoconfinement could help advance the global transition to
cleaner energy... Metallic hydrogen is the densest form of solid
hydrogen - a supremely compact way to store clean fuel. However ... is
classically formed at very high pressures – close to the center of a
planet. Thus, it is energy intense and currently impractical to
produce, but it is predicted to be metastable like
diamonds. Therefore, on removal of the pressure, they remain solid.
[Bristol is] developing an alternative way to increase density at much
lower pressures and higher temperatures .. [w] nanoconfinement"</p>

<hr />
<p>Obviously I am very much interested in metallic H2, for energy storage</p>
<hr />
<p>"For astrophysicists, the Sun imparts lessons which may well have
direct applications for mankind. For instance, the solar body holds
the key to fusion. If the Sun is made from condensed matter, then our
experiments should focus on this state. Sunspots may also guard the
secret to synthesizing metallic hydrogen on Earth. If sunspots are
truly metallic, as reflected by their magnetic fields, then attempts
to form liquid metallic hydrogen on Earth might benefit from the
presence of magnetic fields"</p>
<hr />
<p>Fusion has been the Holy Grail of enegy for a long time. But right now
AFAIK the work on it has stalled. They cant get more energy out of it
than the energy they put in. They keep building machines for it but,
like the LHC, the act of building the machine is more exciting,
fruitful than the result u get from the thing itself. That has been
the story so far.</p>
<hr />
<p>It will help us understand the fusion process more. Work on fusion was
inspired by the Sun, so if we understand the Sun better we might do
fusion better.</p>
<p>"Why does it matter to understand how the Sun works?"</p>

<p>Stiglitz: "Biden’s proposed spending plan is urgently needed. Recently
released data show a slowdown in America’s recovery both in terms
of GDP and employment...</p>
<p>The economy would, of course, be better off without zero interest
rates. It would also be better if policymakers raised taxes by
imposing levies on pollution and restoring greater progressivity to
the tax system. There is no valid reason why the richest Americans
should pay lower taxes as a percentage of their income than those who
are far less well off. Given that wealthy Americans have been the
least affected, medically or economically, by the coronavirus
pandemic, America’s regressive tax system has never looked uglier...</p>
<p>Under President Donald Trump, the programs that focused on small
businesses were not as effective as they could or should have been –
partly because too much of the money went to businesses that were not
really small, and partly because of a rash of administrative problems"</p>

<p>Podcast from the University of California, Irvine, talking to Jack
Brouwer, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at UCI,
also the director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center, as well
as the director of the Advanced Power and Energy Program.</p>
<p>"It’s much more reliable to have both a renewable fuel and renewable
electricity delivered in society. And we experience that today, for
example, when we have the public safety power shutoff events, and when
we have wildfires that shut electric grids down, or when electric
grids themselves cause fires because they become too overloaded. When
these things happen, we depend upon underground delivery of natural
gas, today. Of course, it’s going to have to be transformed to this
renewable hydrogen vector. And when we put those together, we can
envision a 100 percent renewable world that is also reliable"</p>

<p>Both shooting, and weight guessing involves knowledge / skill BTW,
very important. Good noise around bullseye means person knows how to
shoot.  Judging weight by naked eye is possible bcz we have innate
knowledge of weights of things, through evolution, and part of growing
up, so the noise is normal. Stat ppl know this, when they apply a
model to data, they determine whether it is good by looking at its
mistake, its "residual" (diff between model pred, and real data). If
resid is gaussian, they are happy. Bad models leave patterns in
data. When unskilled (or dumb) people eff up you know why. There is
pattern in their eff ups (usually due to some bias).</p>
<hr />
<p>Height is normal of course.. many factors contribute to height. Some
ppl might have a fat ass, small back, others large back, skinny
ass. Large or small head.. All cld lead to same height.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyway; then, if shooting errors, weight guesses are <code>true value + normal noise</code>,
averaging removes noise, bcz average of zero-centered
Gaussian (which is noise) is zero. This is the magic.</p>
<hr />
<p>But if I sum every 6 die throws and histogram,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rolls = [random.randint(1,6) for i in range(b*n)]
rolls = np.array(rolls).reshape(n,b)
s = np.sum(rolls,axis=1)
plt.hist(s,bins=12)
plt.savefig('dice1.png')
</code></pre>
<p><img width="200" src="dice1.png"/></p>
<p>Bell shaped. Normal.</p>
<p>Why? Bcz more sums result in a 6 than 2. I can get 6 with
4+2,2+4,1+5,3+3,etc.. More chance to hit it. Very low, very high nums
are harder. Easy sums form the bulk in the middle.</p>
<hr />
<p>Demo. Throw a 6-sided die 1000 times (numbers below are from software
generator), histogram rolls,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random
n = 1000; b = 6
rolls = [random.randint(1,6) for i in range(b*n)]
rolls = np.array(rolls)
plt.hist(rolls,bins=6)
plt.savefig('dice2.png')
</code></pre>
<p><img width="200" src="dice2.png"/></p>
<p>Nearly uniform (not normal), all equal chance,</p>
<hr />
<p>Normal distribution is weird; it shows up everywhere. Take a group of ppl,
their height dist is normal.</p>
<p>Have someone shoot at a target, measure distance from each hit to
bulls eye, dist is normal.</p>
<p>Whenever many factors <em>contribute</em> to a thing, normality occurs.. bcz
sums of anything (random) approaches normal. And there are many things
like that in nature</p>
<hr />
<p>To elaborate more on how consensus among (knowledgeable) people can
result in correct decisions.. Remember earlier
<a href="../../2020/07/crowd-wisdom.html">post</a> at a country fair 800 people estimated
the weight of an ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the
median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true
weight. Magic.</p>
<p>The reason is, guesses have noise, the right kind of noise, around the
right answer. Averaging removes noise.</p>
<p>The noise distribution is bell-shaped, "normal" or a "Gaussian" (a
dist is the formulaic form of a histogram, occurence count, frequency).</p>

<p>Fast digital payments are a good thing.. But a fiat currency needs the
ability to have its money base expand depending on political
decisions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hal Finney (so called "Satoshi")'s reasoning for creating BTC was
wrong. He created it in the aftermath of 2008 crisis (his pseudo is
taken after his neighbor's name who lost money during crisis), and
thought "printing money" was the culprit. The problem wasnt printing
money per se, but who it was printed for.</p>
<hr />
<p>BTC is absolutely the expression of the naivete coming from common
tech guy - bright, shiny object loving, unaware of landscape, soc
ecosystem, side effects, etc..</p>
<hr />
<p>Left-leaning econs dislike this thing to a man.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the absence of clear-cut scientific law, differing views surface,
and among enough knowledgable people, their average leads to something
acceptably optimal.</p>
<p>In econ there is division around thriftyness and extra spending (some
research popping up on the question but nothing solid), right and left
have different answers. Fine.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin exclusively chooses one side of that argument, ignoring
the other (money base cannot expand = thrift) hence it takes itself
out of the discussion altogether. A country cannot adapt BTC as
currency bcz of this.</p>

possible what they missed is something basic, only two or three steps

<p>Is this relevant today? Well modernity (the second wave, after the
agro first) added its own mental structures that are in some ways even
more encompassing, and intricate. No wonder many ppl are still
interested in these things.. Zen, Buddhism etc, not to mention other
mainstream religions from the West.</p>
<hr />
<p>I guarantee it Eastern religions, Taoism, Buddhism are a protest
against agro, village societies as well..  These societies constructed
a conceptual world with its idols, worship rituals, rhytms so
ever-present that new religions would rebel against. I bet the Zen
koans are packaged to make zero sense in that frame, to stir shit up
in the mind so that only when that frame is dropped, it makes sense,
or rather, the act of trying to make sense is dropped, hence the
practitioner reaches "enlightment".</p>
