I hear some of this "keep it local" talk in left circles too
sometimes.. there the emphasis is in more "social", like they want to
"socially" talk about funding each streetlight, and "socially"
decide. In this case too, professional politician is better, at least
in our current modern setting

Libertards

"The Short, Unhappy Life of a Libertarian Paradise.. *This American
Life* did a segment portraying Springs citizens as the ultimate
anti-tax zealots, willing to pay $125 in a new 'Adopt a Streetlight'
program to illuminate their own neighborhoods, but not willing to
spend the same to do so for the entire city. 'Ill take care of mine'
was the gist of what one council member heard from a resident when she
confronted him with this fact...

From disruption came, well, too much disruption. And from that came a
full-circle return to professional politicians. Including one.. who is
so persuasive he has gotten Colorado Springs residents to do something
the outside world assumed they were not capable of: Five years after
its moment in the spotlight, revenue is so high that the same voters
who refused to keep the lights on have overwhelmingly approved ballot
measures allowing the city to not only keep some of its extra tax
money, but impose new taxes as well"

Right; theoretically you need more money to cover a company's debt,
but its cash would now belong to you (subtract).

"[EV is calculated by] multiplying the company's outstanding shares by
the current market price of one share [market cap, .. to] this number,
add the company's total long-term and short-term debt. Lastly,
subtract the company's cash and cash equivalents.. This result shows
how much money would be needed to buy an entire company. The
enterprise value calculates the theoretical takeover price one company
would need to pay to acquire another company."

"Zoom school" is no good. Ed can be based on prerecorded lecture
videos. The approaches are different. In one there is an average
quality jackass waving his arms online, syncronized, in the other
there is animation-augmented high quality content/teacher potentially
teaching millions, offline/online, **a**synchronized. Priority should
be low-income kids wout access to quality education.

Is *Starship Troopers* satire..? In parts, yes.. It starts out with
some post-Vietnam, anti-war feel. But it ends with a World War II

saluting his student, a "brain bug" having been cought and more "ass
kicking" on the way.

Great that Google shares GDELT files.. But is it AI? Sadly no. The
task is excruciatingly simple, look at a text, figure out who did what
to whom, where. Yet GDT fails in these tasks at times that are
laughable to a human... I look at the doc it clearly say attack was in
Libya. GDT assigns N. Syria. Attacker is IS, it says AFG, as in
gov. You know the shit is state-of-the-art. It's Google! Their *main
job* is NLP. Yet SOTA aint good enough.

Hah they are both Argentinian, good question.

I'd say Messi comes out on top. Maradona was great but he was also a
"flash in the pan" in many ways, he'd shine one game, than nothing for
many others... Messi is a professional. Delivers solid performance in
every game. Team player.

Minorities, cultures, assimilation... let me put it this way.  US has
10% of its population with Irish ancestry. This probably translated
into its cultural make-up, so let's say 10% of US is culturally
Irish. This means EVERYONE in US including the so-called "Irish
people". They are not 100% Irish, they are also 10%. This might bother
some, u thought you were "special", "ethnic", but you are another boring
citizen.
