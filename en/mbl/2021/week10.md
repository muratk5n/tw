[itself](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/trumps-deal-mexico-could-have-unintended-effects/592828/)

Dec 2020: "[ICE] arrested and deported fewer people last fiscal year
than in any other during President Donald Trump's term... a trend the

TBH never really cared for the Khan story of Trek.. Khan is based on a
Trek OS movie, which I watched many years ago, it was ok.. but sorta
old now. No significance for me, at the level of say, Borg.

Beckley, *Unrivaled*: "China has large reserves of oil and natural gas
encased in shale basins, but China has not been able to tap them and,
according to some analyses, may never do so. One reason is that
China’s shale deposits were left behind by prehistoric lakes and,
consequently, have rock layers that are more ductile and less amenable
to hydraulic fracturing than the brittle marine shales in North
America. Another reason is that China lacks the water necessary for
fracking"

Fossil based energy system was advantageous for US.. ample resources
that are easy to get to.. But.. the planet is getting screwed in the

to UK/CH.

Beckley says his method has 8 percentage points more success in
predicting results of conflicts, wars than CINC.

Let's use his method on a few countries,

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../../2020/07/gdpw.csv')
df = df[df['country'].isin(['Turkey','Greece','United States','China']) ]
df['gdp'] = df.gdpcap * df.population
df['mbindex'] = (df.gdpcap * df.gdp)/1e14
print (df[['country','mbindex']])
```

```text
          country     mbindex
13  United States  12898.099255
51         Greece     43.463713
85          China   1363.010190
87         Turkey     68.576017
```

This is so sad... US has 10 times more pow than the next guy. My
tegros are drowning down there in the list, next to, like, Greece.

---


MB doesnt like the widely used military capability index CINC either.
The famous Correlates of War project uses it, but I can see his point;
like the GDP, it's a gross measure, does not account for costs..

His alternative method is GDP x GDP Per Capita. This punishes
population size (GDP Per Capita is GDP divided by population), bcz the
more people you have the more you are spending as well (especially for
nondemocracies they spend on internal security). On the upside GDP Per
Capita rewards innovation, it's a sign of efficiency, being able to
produce more with less means there is innovation in the economy. The
gross obviously has to enter the picture, at some level, that's why it
gets multiplied.

On whether to use GDP for nation-power comparison

M. Beckley: "Despite the widespread use of GDP, however, few people
know what it actually measures or recognize that it does not deduct
costs.  To begin, GDP counts production costs (inputs and
externalities) as output.  Spending money always increases GDP, even
if the funds are wasted on boondoggles; in fact, the most common
method of calculating GDP is called the 'expenditure method' and
involves simply adding up all of the spending done by the government,
consumers, and businesses in a country in a given time period. Thus,
hiring workers always increases GDP, even if they spend all day
getting drunk in the break room. Boosting production always increases
GDP, even if the goods rot on the shelf and tons of toxic waste are
released in the process. In fact, a country can increase its GDP by
dumping toxic waste into the streets and then spending billions of
dollars to clean it up...

Consequently, populous countries generate considerable economic
activity simply by existing. Even a nation caught in a Malthusian
hell, in which all output is immediately devoured, will post a large
GDP if it has a big population.  Finally, GDP counts security spending
as economic output. GDP does not distinguish between guns and
butter. It counts a 100 million dollar gulag the same as a $100 million
innovation center. Hence, GDP fails to account fully for the economic
costs of domestic instability and international conflict. In fact, GDP
usually rises when a country mobilizes for war... In general, however,
resources devoted to policing and protection drain wealth rather than
create it"

"With heating and cooling in buildings responsible for 40% of energy
consumption and 36% of emissions, the importance of its
decarbonisation is paramount. As the current annual renovation rate is
below 1% and more than 70% of heating in buildings is supplied by old
and inefficient boilers, buildings are unanimously recognised as a
hard-to-decarbonise sector...

Direct electrification with heat pumps is not always economically
feasible in every building and will double the peak demand for
electricity in winter in most European countries... The town of
Hassfurt in Germany demonstrates how a cogeneration unit running on
hydrogen can be at the centre of the city’s long-term decarbonisation
strategy"

Bloomberg: "As governments and industries seek less-polluting
alternatives to hydrocarbons, the world’s biggest crude exporter
doesn’t want to cede the burgeoning hydrogen business to China, Europe
or Australia and lose a potentially massive source of income. So it’s
building a $5 billion plant powered entirely by sun and wind that will
be among the world’s biggest green hydrogen makers when it opens in
the planned megacity of Neom in 2025.

The task of turning a patch of desert the size of Belgium into a
metropolis powered by renewable energy falls to Peter Terium, the
former chief executive officer of RWE AG, Germany’s biggest utility,
and clean-energy spinoff Innogy SE...

That should mean plenty of potential customers for the plant called
Helios Green Fuels... Saudi Arabia possesses a competitive advantage
in its perpetual sunshine and wind, and vast tracts of unused
land. Helios’s costs likely will be among the lowest globally and
could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, according to BNEF. That’s
cheaper than some hydrogen made from non-renewable sources today

For starters, Helios will produce 650 tons of hydrogen a day by
electrolysis – enough for conversion to 1.2 million tons per year of
green ammonia. Air Products will buy all of that ammonia, which is
easier to ship than liquid or gaseous hydrogen, and convert it back
upon delivery to customers...

Germany said it needs 'enormous' volumes of green hydrogen, and it
hopes Saudi Arabia will be a supplier"

Salman in his palace office. While talking, the king gazed at a
picture frame on his desk. Off in a corner, the crown prince sat at a
desk, diligently typing on a computer. The officials soon realized
what was going on: MBS was typing out what the king should say; the
picture frame was, in fact, a computer screen, and the king was
reading aloud the script by the crown prince"

I find the way ppl just throw around random info as extremely
archaic. In the future more journalists will do what I just did below;
looking for legit, well curated datasets, and run analysis on them.

Looking at Jan 2021 (Feb data is not in yet)

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
df = pd.read_csv('https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/candidateged/GEDEvent_v21_0_1.csv')
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 20)
df1 = df[(df['side_a'] == 'IS' )]
print (df1[['side_b','deaths_b','country']])
```

```text
                  side_b  deaths_b       country

907            Civilians         0         Syria
950                  SDF         0         Syria
951                  SDF         0         Syria
952                  SDF         0         Syria
953                  SDF         0         Syria
954                  SDF         0         Syria
956                  HTS         1         Syria
```

I'd say attacks are lower than average. And just looking at Syria I
can't see how 66 number can be reached. Sounds too high.

(Also; IS killed 5 Taleban, in Afganistan??? WTF?)

Let's check 2020. I am going to use Uppsala Conflict [datasets](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/),
montly IS activity plot,


```python
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
df = pd.read_csv('https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/candidateged/GEDEvent_v20_01_20_12.csv',parse_dates=True)
df1 = df[(df['side_a'] == 'IS' )]
df1['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df1['date_start'])
df1['mon'] = df1.date.dt.month
df1.groupby('mon').size().plot()
g2 = df1.groupby('mon').sum()['deaths_b'].plot()
plt.legend(['Attacks','Deaths'])
plt.title('IS Activity')
plt.savefig('out.png')
```

<img width="340" src="twimg/Ev0SdqoXMAcQltI.png"/>

Monthly occurence of attacks globally hover around 30.

Was it that high? 🤔 Plus what's missing here is context, what
is the trend, and how many deaths were there, etc.

"North Press Agency counted 66 military operations, which the Islamic
State (ISIS) claimed responsible for, in north and east Syria during
January and February, 2021"
