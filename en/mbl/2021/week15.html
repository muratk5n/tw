<p>CJR: "As discussions on how to help save local news continue, new
bills and ideas have come to the fore. Independent newspapers are
coalescing around the Local Journalism Sustainability Act which
proposes direct subsidies (in the form of tax credits) for news
subscribers, local journalists and small business advertisers. Sweden
has a similar news subsidy system.</p>
<p>Large media outlets are backing the Journalism Competition and
Preservation Act which will allow outlets to band together to
negotiate with Google and Facebook. In some ways this is like

<p>Beckley: "Historically, when fast-growing great powers slow down, they
do not mellow out. Instead, they become more repressive at home and
aggressive abroad. They crack down on domestic dissent and expand
overseas to find new sources of wealth, rally citizens around the
ruling regime, and deter foreign rivals from exploiting their economic
problems. China is already on this path—as its growth slows, it is
repressing freedom in the mainland and in Hong Kong, ramping up
pressure on Taiwan, colonizing the South China Sea, building the
largest navy in the world, and buying assets and building ports all
over the world"</p>
