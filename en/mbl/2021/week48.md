Privatization in law is probably one of the most harmful places to
have it than anywhere else, being able to get "the best defense money
can buy" can tip the balance considerably. Then both sides are not
equal under the law. Nationalize the law firms! Either that, or
introduce a "forced pro bono" where lawyers from private firms must
contribute a portion of their time to the public for free.

MSNBC: "A deep dive by ProPublica identified at least 18 billionaires

receive much of what the rest of us rely on as income. In the case of
each of the 18 billionaires, none took an income greater than $75,000,
which entitled them to taxpayer funded relief money"

isn't one either. FR has good capability to be sure, just not SP. The
EU however is one (in econ, could be in mil too one day), FR benefits
from that. Ergo if China wanted to project power, has to join others.

Xerox did some good innovation as a private company, though the lab

that it is more of a hand-to-mouth existence now, whatever is "out there",

Automated agro company Iron Ox did away with artificial lights typical
vertical farm uses, they use sunlight instead.. In the right place
sunlight cld be cheap. But in that case cannot stack up layers bcz
upper shelves would block sunlight for the lower shelves..

"As the world’s population grows exponentially, our total supply of
fruits and vegetables is falling 22% short of global nutritional
needs. Traditional farming methods are having difficulties meeting
this demand as it faces increasing problems such as water shortage,
land scarcity.. In recent years, controlled environment agriculture
has experienced a surge of popularity as it presents a compelling
solution to all these problems and more. Indoor vertical farming can
increase crop yields, overcome limited land area...

Vertical farms are unique in that some setups don’t require soil for
plants to grow. Most are either hydroponic, where vegetables is grown
in a nutrient-dense bowl of water, or aeroponic, where the plant roots
are systematically sprayed with water and nutrients. In lieu of
natural sunlight, artificial grow lights are used...

Recent technological advances in the agriculture space allow vertical
farms to control every aspect of growing crops. Variables such as
light, humidity, and water can all be precisely measured year
round. Since crops are no longer reliant on weather patterns,
temperatures, or daylight, this means produce can be reliably grown
24/7...

Labor has always been a pain point in agriculture..  Vertical farming
can significantly reduce labor needs, and therefore cost, by using
robots to handle harvesting, planting, and logistics...

Vertical farms are built to optimize energy conservation by
significantly reducing water and energy usage. Studies show that
vertical farms use up to 70% less water than traditional farms..

Since indoor vertical farms are completely sealed off from the outside
environment, there are virtually no pests. As a result, there is
virtually no need for pesticides or herbicides. Food grown is
healthier, safer, and certified organic, making it even more appealing
to consumers"

Base info: Nordstream 2 can deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas per
year. Natural gas contains 5367.27 kWh of energy per cubic meter of
gas.

Convert that to Gigawatts,

```python
kwh_year = 55*1e9 / 5367.27
print ("%0.2f" % (kwh_year / (365*24*1000)), 'GW')
```

```text
1.17 GW
```

The mega CSP plant in Chile has 110 MW capacity. That means roughly 10
of those plants will equal the Nordstream 2 pipeline. This is not bad
at all. Fantastic actually. Fossil f has been sitting there, basting,
for millions of years. But we can equal it with tech.

Strong reverse correlation.

I checked Granger causality, to see the direction of the cause from
the data, early time horizon FX effects current account. Later horizon
shows account effecting currency. So in a way it's a chicked-and-egg
problem, but from Nikolas Müller-Plantenberg
[research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46490787_Balance_of_payments_accounting_and_exchange_rate_dynamics),
we know the primary direction is CA->FX. You need to have products to
sell so people demand your currency. If you are buying more than you are
selling, save other balancing factors, currency will adjust to that.
