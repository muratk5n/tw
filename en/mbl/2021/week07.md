"Nicolas [Brahy] will join the hydrogen infrastructure fund initiative
...which intends to play a critical role in the context of the
European Green Deal and the climate activities of the European
Union. Many Member States have already earmarked more than 45 billion
Euros in their respective national hydrogen strategies. Public funding
will need to be blended with private investment in order to guarantee
long term market structures. Nicolas is perfectly suited to boost the
investment activities and will integrate his broad knowledge into the
acceleration of hydrogen development"

"The United States went to war in Vietnam for multiple reasons but the
basic reason was Charles De Gaulle. The American strategy at the time
was to contain the Soviet Union with a string of alliances swinging
from Norway all the way through [Vietnam], and blocked them through
expanding [alliances]. Charles de Gaulle came along and said "you
can't trust the americans because if they ever attacked the Americans
wouldn't come ...  you you're going to be left alone we have to form
our own NATO independent of the United States". During the Vietnam War
there's a word that became incredibly important *credibility*.
Credibility meant that how credible were the American guarantees to
this all-important structure of containment, how credible was it that
we would come to Germany's aid, or Japan's aid with everything we had,
if they were a war. And a terrible fear that time was that these
people would lose confidence in us. So part of the reason we went to
Vietnam had nothing to do with Vietnam the fear was that if we didn't
go to Vietnam our credibility with our other allies would be gone and
the entire American strategy will collapse on that basis. There was no
expectation [we would end up with] 50,000 dead, on that basis the
expectation was that we would go into a small police action we may win
it, we may lose it, but the Germans would know that our guarantee
means something"

The Atlantic: "The lower 48 U.S. states are divided into two big
electrical grids—except for Texas, which maintains its own independent
system. (Small, outlying parts of the state belong to the big grids.)
The state maintains a separate grid to avoid having to comply with
federal regulation. If Texas had been connected to the broader
national grid, the state might have been able to borrow power that
would have filled the hole left when large parts of the system failed
in this storm: As demand for energy for heating surged, power plants
went offline, equipment froze, and wind turbines froze too. Instead,
Texas has experienced staggering blackouts"

Forbes: "In July 2020, Microsoft tested hydrogen fuel cells for backup
power at its data centers. This move aligns with its commitment to be
carbon negative by 2030 and eliminate dependency on diesel fuel by 2030.
While still in the exploratory stages of using fuel cells as
backup generators, the company hopes to scale the 250 kW system to a 3
MW system, which is equivalent to diesel-powered generators currently
at its data centers...

When comparing levelized costs for a completely resilient, 100%
renewable data center with zero emissions, hydrogen is 119 dollar/MWh,
while batteries could be over 4,000 dollar/MWh to ensure 48 hours of
backup power [.. from Jack Brouwer, a professor of mechanical and
aerospace engineering at the University of California, Irvine]"

Yes. And inflation is a major risk for bonds / treasuries, the pricing
of which reflects the market's perception of future inflation, and
indirectly growth (growth => rising wages => more money in
circulation, inflation).

"Inflation will also affect interest rate levels. The higher the
inflation rate, the more interest rates are likely to rise. This
occurs because lenders will demand higher interest rates as
compensation for the decrease in purchasing power of the money they
are paid in the future"

Newton, other early modern phy computed all the time. It's fine to go

Landau wrote some fantastic books. Id listen to him.

Landau: "There can be little argument that computation has become an
essential element in all areas of physics, be it via simulation,
symbolic manipulations, data manipulations, equipment
interfacing... [E]ven though the style of teaching and organization of
subjects being taught by physics departments have changed in recent
times, the actual content of the courses has been slow to incorporate
the new-found importance of computation. Yes, there are now speciality
courses and many textbooks in Computational Physics, but that is not
the same thing as incorporating computation into the very heart of a
modern physics curriculum so that the physics being taught today more
closely resembles the physics being done today"

Creator is [more likely](../../0119/2015/04/god.html)

"Which is likely? Creator or not?"

---

By turning something into a process, we dont automatically remove "an
omnipotent creator" from the picture. Everyone likes the invention of
evolution. "God did not create the final thing, it was an evolutionary
process". Boom. Darwin is world famous.

"Well now let's apply that to the universe".. thought some? "God did
not make it happen, it started from a small seed, turned into
everything we see"

Except the creator isnt exactly removed from the picture, ie the most
enthusiastic supporters of Big Bang were and are the Clergy. That one
one focused, 'big' creational event must have jelled more with their
view of the creator.

But an omnipo being can bring stuff into existence, close to what they
are now, just as easily as some magic process that will evolve stuff
into as they are now. Dont want to assume either way, what I am saying
