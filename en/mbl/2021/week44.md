# Week 44

Sales and bullshit is also part of the job. See Jobs [talk at MIT](https://youtu.be/YXUhLbV8Nrg?t=738).
Look how he talks about great rivalries, his new machine / OS NextStep,
the big, bad rival Sun is trying to kill him, he is growing 2x, 4x..

Well; That machine only sold 50,000 units. The OS is a Unix variant
could not have existed without academia. They made changes to it added
stuff on top which weren't really good, the code would eventually
find its way into iPhones later, changed some more, arriving to its
current form which senior Linux devs still call a piece of shit. Linux
is of course open source, the largest software project ever undertaken
by mankind.

Tech CEO is mostly the "getting excited" guy. He'll "get excited" on a
tech be an internal evangelist for it, which can motivate employees to
work on it more, in a sense of "mission". Administrative duties are
important of course, but dont need deep sci mind for that.

---

Biz does not have the capacity for true research. They think too
short-term, the "need to show something" is too strong. 

"AlphaGo Zero shows that corporate R&D has starved basic research in
favor of safe bets and tinkering at the margins. Deepmind's AlphaGo
Zero — which taught itself to play a remarkable game of Go in just 72
hours — is an ironic poster child for this phenomenon. AlphaGo is part
of a long-term shift in AI research from generating machine
comprehension to "machine learning" that is just a fancy form of
statistical analysis, a brute-force approach that relies on ingesting
lots of human decisions and making statistical observations that can
be used as predictions about the future"

Every student deserves to learn from the best, as I learned from Arthur
Mattuck. Here's my vid based [ed plan]((../../0119/2018/09/public-education.html))

quash this profession as we know it.

The backlash didn't take place bcz of shitlib failure making movies

reason was econ. But some doubled down made the fail more visible, the

insane asylum shit..

Murdoch is a native of the country anyway, he cut his teeth there,

Climate decisions do not come easy for Oz. The country is a major
resource exporter, but also Murdoch media, of Australia, is active
there, scratches that itch constantly, the way they do for culture war
in America. An earlier PM thinks he was done in by Murdoch for
climate.. The current coalition partner had an internal coup bcz of
Net Zero discussions.

That Yosemite plant output isn't bad.. H2 energy density is 33.6
kWh/kg, 12,200 kg generation per day, and with 30 kwh usage assumption
per day, per home

```python
"enough energy for %d homes" % (33.6*12200/30)
```

```text
Out[1]: 'enough energy for 13664 homes'

That is enough energy for a largish LA neighborhood.. Silver Lake,
Los Feliz, Koreatown. Or Encino, East Holywood..  A single
plant. Generating energy from waste.

"Yosemite Clean Energy wants to produce 12,200 kg of green hydrogen

of California’s estimated 35-million-tonnes of annual waste woody
biomass which is left to burn, decay, and decompose, emitting
greenhouse gases and black carbon"

Al Monitor: "The US flew a nuclear-capable B-1B bomber over major
waterways of the Middle East [as a] show of force amid tensions.. with
Iran. Aircraft from US partners Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and
Israel joined the bomber at various stages of the flight, which
included a pass over the Strait of Hormuz..  The B-1 also reportedly
flew over the Red Sea, Suez Canal and the Bab al-Mandeb.

The bomber took off from the US airbase on Diego Garcia, a remote
island in the Indian Ocean that is likely to become increasingly
important as Washington seeks to further shift the weight of its
military presence from the Middle East to Asia and the Pacific.

An undisclosed number of B-1Bs deployed to Diego Garcia last month to
bolster US bomber task force missions in the Pacific"

It is odd China is experiencing power issues, electricity is getting
cut, diesel, coal price is rising, yet their Southwest region has
similar solar potential as Australia.

---

Coal, NG can still contribute through CCS.

Discourage its export, is transmission, the only thing that "moves"
should be green molecules. The rest is renewable generation, either
local, and more in countries who are rich of it like some are in oil
and they export that in molecules as well (H2 pipelines or ammonia).

---

Nuclear isn't a panacea either.. For countries who have experience
with it, fine, but nuke energy has an enormous waste storage problem.

It's interesting how open to violence this region is, even after all

With the "emotional brain" concept I dont mean a person "getting
excited", and "in the heat of the moment" fail to make rational
decisions. No... even when a person is silently sitting with no
external stimuli or visible disturbances, they are mostly deciding
emotionally (culturally). Unless one is concious of it, it is
extremely hard to cancel out that stuff, the emotional will almost
always override the rational.

For the lazy or busy readers, here is the lithium calculation. Energy
stored per kilogram of lithium,

```python
kgkwh = 60/70 #kg/kWh
"%0.2f kg/kwh" % kgkwh
```

```text
Out[1]: '0.86 kg/kwh'
```

Divide the weight of all lithium in the world (dug up or otherwise),
17 million tons, by the number above,

```python
reserves = 17*1e6*1e3 # tonnes
batcap = reserves / kgkwh
"all battery capacity using all lithium: %0.2f kwh" % batcap
```

```text
Out[1]: 'all battery capacity using all lithium: 19833333333.33 kwh'
```

This is the maximum energy storage capacity we can have.

World consumption in one year (2013) was 157,481 Terrawatt
Hours. Divide by 365 per day, and compare,

```python
energy_daily = (157481. / (365)) * 1e9 # Kwh
"%0.2f percent" % (batcap / energy_daily * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '4.60 percent'
```

Only 5% of the energy need can be stored in batteries. That wont make
a dent in the fight against climate change.

"The Hurricane That Was So Powerful It Affected The American

This is why leadership matters and direct democracy in a modern
setting cannot work. There isn't much wisdom in the "community".

---

One gent, a hack actually, hired by CATO, Jerry Taylor, was tasked
with arguing against climate change on various media (but later
changed his mind) offers great insight into public / voter decisions,
their perceptions.. "People dont take positions because they find
themselves reasoned into those positions, they take positions they
want to take for emotional or ideological reasons and they mobilize
their reasoning power to justify taking the positions they want to
take". Essentially [same analysis](2014/06/the-culture-code.html) given
in *The Culture Code*. Emotional brain (containing culture) overrides
the analytical. Politics 101.

Propane packs a punch. Clean molecules cld replace it.

summer, right?
