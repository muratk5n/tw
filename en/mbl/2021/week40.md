Electricity tech pretty much sucks at everything except in certain
end-products which shaped the experience of an entire generation of
white-collor folk. They see lights go blink-blink and they get all
excited, and want to use that thing that makes things go blink-blink
for everything.. This is unrealistic.

---

Electricity based heating is incredibly inefficient (surprise). 

---

If green heating takes priority two things need to happen; 1) encourage
production of small, portable, H2/NH3 heating units, provided cheaply to
the world (otherwise they'll just burn wood, coal). Lavo was
[already working](https://revolution-green.com/unsw-develop-hydrogen-storage-renewables/)
on such a tech to power ovens (using a heat-exchange chemical reaction)
with simple H2 canisters. 2) For home heating, massive H2 pipeline
infra needs to be built which can provide homes
the fuel, they can use that for heating, through CHP.

Fortescue is from AU which has plenty of renewable potential of its
own. Then why go to Jordan..? These guys must be thinking four steps
ahead.. When the whole world wakes up to the potential of this stuff,
everyone will try to grab opportunities from sunny countries; well
Fortescue is in there now, locking in commitments... Europeans are in
North Africa. Saudi Arabia is already working with Japan.

"Jordanian government officials have met with a delegation from
Fortescue Metals Group to discuss investment opportunities in green
hydrogen and ammonia"

"[4/2021] Ramped-up domestic production of green hydrogen and ammonia
makes perfect sense for South Korea. Last month a deal was signed
between Australia-based Origin Energy and steelmaker POSCO for the
supply of green hydrogen in the form of green ammonia, produced at
Origin’s to-be-developed, hydro-powered ammonia production facility in
Bell Bay, Tasmania. Although POSCO is aiming for the import of
zero-carbon feedstock to be only temporary, the sheer scale of their
goal to produce 5 million tonnes of clean hydrogen in South Korea by
2050 is readily apparent"

If co2 increases are during the winter, then priority should be to fix
heating, making that process renewable.. Surprise (!) H2, NH3 are the
best solutions for that as well. See CHP, Combined Heat and Power.

Clearly the increases are due to Northern Hemisphere
winter.

Then... 🤔 if everyone had a home in both hemispheres, went from one
to the other escaping colder season, there would be no CO2 increase..

kept going up.

Electric transmission is incredibly inefficient \#deelectrify

---

Generate renewable fuel from fossil, CCS at the source, transmit.
H2 pipelines [work](twimg/EvdKNhvXAAE9Rr2.png).

Producing from green is better of course.. Politics will decide the
balance. But transmission must be green, and molecule based.

---

Renewable fuel pipelines wouldn't have this problem in case of
leak. No env damage (you'd be putting more H2 into H2O.. it's like,
who cares?).

USA Today: "California oil spill: Pipeline wasn't shut down for more
than 3 hours after pressure failure alert, feds say..  The U.S. Coast
Guard said divers located a split in the pipeline more than a
foot-long. Investigators believe it could be the source of the leak"

France has an efficient economy... This is key, esp. during wartime.

df['mbindex'] = (df.gdpcap * df.gdp)/1e14
print (df[['country','mbindex']])

Asking a socmed company to decide themselves to not make something go
viral.. that's like asking McDonalds to sell less burgers.. Tough
ask. Can they determine when something has high DMSI but "can be
dangerous"? The answer is no, because the AI tasked with that job
doesn't work (she said this many times, it's true, even a lot of weak
AI is extremely shoddy). Good testimony though.. there was lots of
useful info in it.

"During the hearing, [Facebook whistleblower] Haugen mentioned that
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to not remove downstream MSI, or
Meaningful Social Interactions, because, rumor has it, peoples'
bonuses were tied to it. Haugen was formerly a product manager on
Facebook's civic integrity team, which focused on election
issues. Facebook got rid of her team shortly before the Jan. 6 riots,
and she quit her job in April.

The downstream MSI is a problematic tool because it predicts when
something might go viral — get a lot of views, shares, and comments —
and then it pushes that content out to more users"

Most companies cannot use, approach the DARPA model.. preferring an
actor-geek CEO instead, who will acquire, acqu-hire, or madly toss
together actually known tech in a bowl hoping something will come out
of it while trying to look "brave" in the process.

"The most worrisome factor is that China's delay might reflect not a
holdup in the preparation of its NDC, but a well-rehearsed plan to
leverage its climate change commitments into other areas where the
Biden administration has increased pressure on Beijing...

First, the weaponization of climate change measures might be seen by
the Biden administration as cutting off the last possibility of
cooperation with China, making the bilateral relationship much more
hostile. This is also a possibility in the case of Europe, given the
increasing importance of climate change in European citizens'
priorities"

I have to say this is a fantastic application of mathematics to a
real-world problem. Based on two numbers the formula generates
near accurate counts for the entire grid structure. V cool.

---

Poisson distr is,

$$ f(x) = P(X=x) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!} $$

which gives probability of 1 event, 2 events, in a certain block of
time. But in geo you have to think little differently. You divide
London into grids, and count how many bombs fell on each, then count
how many grids had 1 bomb, 2 bombs, etc. Reproducing such counts from
formula,

```python
N = 576.
m = 537/N
c = N*np.exp(-m)
expb = [c*1, c*m, c*m**2/2, c*(m**3)/(3*2)]
[np.round(e,2) for e in expb]
```

```text
Out[1]: [226.74, 211.39, 98.54, 30.62]
```

Real counts were 229, 211, 93, 35, etc. Pretty close. I am sure a
statistical test wld agree. Clustering disproved. 

---

Why the Poisson distribution usage in this [post](../../2021/08/bermuda.html)?
Event counts tend to be distributed that way.. Let's take the London
bombing [example](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-actuaries/article/abs/an-application-of-the-poisson-distribution/F75111847FDA534103BD4941BD96A78E).
They were wondering if bombings were clustering at specific places.
Cld be important.. Maybe Nazis were focusing bombing somewhere? Poisson
is for natural counts, then if that is proven, clustering is disproved.
