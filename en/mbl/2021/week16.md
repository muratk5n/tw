# Week 16

Wanna be outdoors, be outdoors. Hike, camp whatever. Be outdoors like
like a forager, the way we've lived for half a million years.

"But I want to be outdoors, work the land"

---

Since the approach is well contained and controlled, I bet it can be
fully automated one day.. Load up seeds from one end, come back in two
months to get your fully grown beans from the other end..

---

VF approach uses artificial light, artificial soil, utilizes less
water, it is a completely contained environment can be easier to
protect against chaotic weather, harmful instects (less need for
pesticides, another bonus).

"Vertical or indoor farming is increasingly heralded as the future of
modern agriculture... These companies have been able to raise millions
of dollars to expand their current facilities and establish new
ones...

Fundamental to the creation of a perfect indoor farming environment
for both small and large operations is the availability of affordable,
sophisticated lighting technologies. In fact, there are many different
types of grow lights... 

In its simplest definition, a grow light is an artificial source of
light, commonly an electric light, which is designed to stimulate the
growth of plants by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum perfect for
photosynthesis"

Our focus is fundamental tech, not trinkets.

Toiling away on a piece of land, throwing bunch of shit on the soil,
(pesticides etc seeping into the soil). Isnt this incredibly outdated?
Technology should transform this field..

Thoughtful piece from @timhepher at @Reuters captures key issue..
@Universal_H2 can decarbonize regional aviation in the 2020s--no
problem. The big challenge is to de-risk hydrogen for @Boeing &
@Airbus to make 737 & A320 successor in 2030s zero-emissions!"
Otherwise there's no way for aviation to meet Paris Agreement
targets. Synfuels and biofuels are a partial carbon offset scheme that
doesn't get us to the 1.5°C emissions trajectory. There just isn't
another way!

H2 from thin air.. Also (perhaps more important), a better way for
electrolysis (boil water, get the vapor, this process will electrolyze
it better)

"Mihalis Tsampas['s group] worked on a method to split water in its
vapor phase, which occurs much more frequently than its liquid
phase. Working with gas instead of liquid has several advantages
explains Tsampas. There are a few technical problems with liquids,
such as undesired bubbles, also there is no need for expensive
installations to purify the water by using water in the gaseous phase
instead of the liquid phase. And finally by using the water that is
present in the surrounding air, their technology can also be used in
remote places where no water is available"

They can still go ahead and break away, EU will welcome that.. Catalan
situation went awry bcz of the power-setup rather than legalese.. The
EU did not back Catalonia's independence.. They would however
*wholeheartedly* back a Scottish independence.

"UK PM has to grant permission for a [Scottish] referendum but [PM]
has made it clear he has no intention of doing this. Whether the
Scottish parliament has the legal right to organise a referendum
without Westminster's permission is a question that has never been
tested in court. One option may be to just go ahead anyway to try to
hold a referendum, and so then what? Then you may be into a situation
that Catalonia found itself in where it pushed ahead with a referendum
that was not seen to be within the legal order of the Spanish
Constitution"

"One country that has already seen significant growth in fuel cell
usage is South Korea. *Power* [magazine] reported on three new
electricity generating facilities based on fuel cell technology that
were deployed in South Korea last summer: a 50-MW power plant placed
in ...  Seosan, a 19.8-MW installation in Hwasung, and an 8.1-MW
facility in Paju. 'Part of the magic that we’re seeing in Korea as it
relates to stationary power using fuel cells is incentives,' said Joe
Cargnelli, director of engineering for Cummins’ Fuel Cell and Hydrogen
Technologies division. “What Korea has done is they’ve created
essentially the feed-in tariff for fuel cells—for stationary fuel
cells. So, if you think back to how solar energy and wind energy got
started back in the mid-90s, it was through a solar feed-in tariff and
a wind tariff, and it started in Germany and kind of caught on, and
that’s what sort of gave solar and wind their start. Korea has done
that for fuel cells and stationary power. So, they have incentives
that promote the deployment of stationary fuel cells and [they’ve
been] highly successful, and I think it’s a great strategy.'"

No wonder, under the crust there is magma, at 1000° C degrees, only
the Sun itself is hotter (5000° C). Hell the inner Earth core is as
hot as the Sun! So theoretically it is unlimited energy. Challanges

the deployment of geothermal energy"

---

Crypto mining is there to encourage people to share their computing
resources with the network right? First of all, Nano proved you can
have a crypto without mining, but, let's say u need computing
resources for additional services. Then, wouldnt a computing
environment that promises constant availability of such resources, and
offers them peer-to-peer, be a better fit for a crypto? I am thinking
of DFinity Internet Computer right now.. A crypto would be just
another app on such a platform. There will be chat app, social net
app, and crypto app.
