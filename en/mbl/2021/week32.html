<p>SNAM is one of the world's largest infrastructure companies. Here is
its CEO <a href="https://youtu.be/sZlHFKaKJU0?t=273">on CNBC</a>, talking about
reusing existing pipelines for H2 transport. </p>
<hr />
<p>He says he was mistakenly cast.. How the hell does that happen?

<hr />
<p>ZeroAvia CEO was on F24, great interview. He used the word 'hydrogen
electric' a lot. Good idea, for marketing.. The "e-word" is associated
with all kinds of 'good things for climate' in people's minds it makes
sense to ride that marketing wave. Technically the use is correct, a
fuel-cell converts H2 into electricity so the whole system <em>is</em>
hydrogen-electric. There are BEVs, there are FCEVs -- both are EVs.</p>
<p>But decision makers need to understand what's going on under the hood,
the overall system, in terms of emphasis (and dollars). With H2
electric, electricity comes in to the picture <em>dead last</em>, right
before it is used. Until that point the entire production, transport,
storage can remain in gas / liquid / molecules -- no electricity
needed.</p>

affiliated with [ISIS]. There are also nearly a million
civilians. These rebels have nowhere to go and will fight to the death
rather than surrender... The Assads don’t want any 'fight to death'
battle in Idlib and the Russians unofficially propose a more
traditional tactic for this siege situation; starve them out. While an
ancient and often successful tactic, this approach is currently
considered a war crime by most, but not all, nations"</p>

relationships with extremely rich people. These rich often run
extremely large corporate empires and can steer their corporate
banking business to the banks that cater to their personal needs...</p>

<p>The Guardian: "New Zealand, Iceland, the UK, Tasmania and Ireland are
the places best suited to survive a global collapse of society,
according to a study.</p>
<p>The researchers said human civilisation was 'in a perilous state' due
to the highly interconnected and energy-intensive society that had
developed and the environmental damage this had caused.</p>
<p>To assess which nations would be most resilient to such a collapse,
countries were ranked according to their ability to grow food for
their population, protect their borders from unwanted mass migration,
and maintain an electrical grid and some manufacturing
ability. Islands in temperate regions and mostly with low population
densities came out on top.</p>
<p>The researchers said their study highlighted the factors that nations
must improve to increase resilience. They said that a globalised
society that prized economic efficiency damaged resilience, and that
spare capacity needed to exist in food and other vital sectors...</p>
<p>'We were quite surprised the UK came out strongly.. But it has the
potential to withstand shocks.'"</p>

<p>A good actor can make a good script phenomenal. That is true. </p>
<hr />
<p>"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage". Good saying. A great
actor cannot save a bad script, or bad directing. Movies are mostly
about the story, the camera angles, when to cut etc.</p>
<p>Therefore what we see as successful actors are not just good actors,
but know how to pick scripts (and directors). They have an eye for
it. Otherwise they'd be toast.  Appear in wrong movies a few times you
are done bcz great work is not just about acting, but the overall
production.</p>
