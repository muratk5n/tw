H2, then just add water and H2 comes out?</p>

<p>US DOE: "Ideal [military] equipment weight is 30% of a person’s body
weight, but some soldiers have to carry more than 100 pounds. To
lighten the load, the Army is looking into replacing lithium-ion
batteries with fuel cells for power generation—decreasing battery
weight by 50%. These 'wearable power systems' for the dismounted
solider can produce 20 watts (W) of continuous output and 35W of peak

working to drive down the cost of aluminum hydride—a promising
material that can be used for storing hydrogen to utilize in these
portable fuel systems"</p>

<p>US DOE: "CHP technology can be deployed quickly, cost-effectively, and
with few geographic limitations. CHP can use a variety of fuels, both
fossil- and renewable-based. It has been employed for many years,
mostly in industrial, large commercial, and institutional
applications. CHP may not be widely recognized outside [those]
circles, but it has quietly been providing highly efficient
electricity and process heat to some of the most vital industries,
largest employers, urban centers, and campuses in the United States"</p>

<hr />
<p>Using electricity from the grid, and w electric heaters producing heat
is a bad, bad idea. The grid is only 40% efficient, elec. heating is
33%, giving you overall efficiency of 13%.</p>
<p>Molecule based transmission is more efficient, use that to generate
both heat and electricity, on site, through this CHP.</p>
<hr />
<p>Either in fossil (turbine) or FC mode, CHP takes the heat that comes
from the internal operation as a side product, and uses it for boiling
water that also provides heat.</p>
<hr />
<p>"When house owners need a new heating system and oil is no longer an
option due to environmental concerns, then a gas heating system is
considered in most cases. In combination with a fuel cell system,
heating with gas becomes even more efficient and
eco-friendly. Recently, PACE partner Sunfire has launched its new fuel
cell system Sunfire-Home 750, which operates on natural gas or
liquefied propane gas (LPG) and is based on the solid oxide fuel cells
technology (SOFCs)"</p>

the unemployment rate to appear to be much less than it actually

follow from bad data. In addition, the mismeasurement leaves analysts
to wonder why there is so much discontent in a society with full
employment ...</p>

<p><a name='quaternions'></a></p>
<p>New Direction</p>
<p>The new direction of physics can involve quaternions. From <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Reality-Space-Time-Illusion/dp/B0849ZXQB1">The Mathematical Reality Why Space and Time are an Illusion</a>:
"As early as the 1930s, the Dutch physicist and close friend of
Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, wondered why the wave functions for matter
(complex numbers) and light (vector fields) were mathematically so
different. The importance of this profound question is still
underestimated today. If one follows the mission to explain natural
phenomena in a unified picture, light and matter must be contained in
a single formalism. This means that there has to be a mathematical
object that on the one hand, must be a little more complicated than
vectors and complex numbers, but on the other hand must incorporate
their properties...</p>
<p>Hamilton..  one of the most brilliant mathematicians of all time
.. started to study complex numbers. If it was possible to define a
multiplication in two dimensions in such an amazing way, was it also
possible in three dimensions?... On 16 October 1843, while walking
along the Royal Canal in Dublin, Hamilton finally came up with the
answer. In three dimensions it was indeed impossible; but at that
moment, he realized that the tricky multiplication of complex numbers
could be transferred to a four-dimensional number system called
quaternions that had three imaginary units $i$, $j$, $k$ instead of
just one $i$. Whether Hamilton could already have imagined the
fascinating rotations that occur in this number system, we do not
know. In any case, overjoyed at his idea, he carved the constituting
equations into a stone of a nearby bridge..</p>
<p>$$
i^2 = k^2 = j^2 = i \cdot j \cdot k = -1
$$</p>
<p>... If we come back to the philosophical question of what mathematical
structure could potentially describe all physical phenomena,
quaternions are a strikingly simple possibility. Since they contain
both complex numbers and conventional vectors as a subset,
quaternions, in principle, can represent all the number systems
physicists have used in their description of the elementary phenomena
light and matter"</p>

<p>True, libs have their own party in UK. </p>
<p>Jacobin: "A major reason why the US welfare state is so meager, its
union movement so frail, and its working class so divided is that the
United States is the only advanced capitalist democracy where parties
of big business have always monopolized the political arena. The
morbid symptoms of this impasse are everywhere today, from the rise of
Trumpism, to the Democratic establishment’s stubborn opposition to
Medicare for All in the midst of a pandemic, to the deepening
polarization of national politics along partisan lines free from any
focus on redistributing wealth and power.</p>
<p>Identifying this problem, unfortunately, has proven to be much easier
than effectively overcoming it. ...</p>
<p>Like the United States today, the UK had an entrenched two-party
system in which the Liberal Party was politically hegemonic over
workers and their organizations in the late nineteenth century. Aiming
to win over the Libs’ working-class base, socialists avoided the twin
perils of marginalization and co-optation by organizing in and against
the party, building workplace militancy, confronting establishment
Liberals when possible, and allying with them when necessary.</p>
<p>The result was a decades-long dirty break, culminating in the founding
of the Labour Party in 1906 and its displacement of the Liberals"</p>

<p>"Both <em>Ghostbusters</em> and its sequel were a perfect encapsulation of
Ronald Reagan’s 1980s, and the two movies reflect the ambivalent and
inchoate resentments of a rapidly deindustrializing working class. But
the most important — and culturally significant — embodiment of the
'Me First' decade in Ghostbusters was a small, pudgy green ghost who
eventually became known as 'Slimer.' ...</p>
<p>Instead of Slimer, Afterlife’s creators have given us Muncher, a
blobbish ghost who looks like Gudetama joined the Blue Man Group and
became carbuncular with tumors. Where Slimer was joy, Muncher is
depression; where Slimer was sex, Muncher is abstinence; where Slimer
gave his captors a run for their money, Muncher is snail-like; where
Slimer was booze and cocaine, Muncher is ketamine and opioids; and,
most important, where Slimer devoured with hedonistic abandon, Muncher
merely munches.</p>
<p>If Slimer was the Marquis de Sade, Muncher is a basement-dwelling
failson. Sluggish and anhedonic, neutered and soft, the big blue ghost
is the perfect embodiment of our era of permanent decline, in which
every downwardly mobile middle-class American has become lobotomized
by the internet and unsustainable consumption"</p>

<p>"An electric furnace is a type of heating system which utilizes
electricity to heat the home, often using a fan to provide forced-air
through the home's ducts. It is generally more expensive to heat a
home using electricity rather than natural gas or other [wink wink H2]
sources of fuel. The cost of running an electric furnace varies
significantly depending on the size of the home, the type of electric
furnace used, cost of electricity, and the climate. Electric furnaces
range from 10 kilowatts to 50 kilowatts, we estimate that a 2,400
square foot home using a modern high efficiency electric furnace uses
18,000 watts for heating when the furnace is being used"</p>

<p>This confirms what's known from caravans, campervans, motorhomes;
batteries are for non-essential appliances, Nintendo, Playstation
console or whatever, but for anything serious, AC, heating, oven, they
have a gas based solution.</p>
<p>"If you’re one of those homeowners looking to add a home battery
system to your solar installation .. things you should know
... Whole-home backup protection is not possible for very long. No
residential storage system on the market has enough power and storage
capacity to run an entire home, regardless of their
advertising... Most homes use between 20 and 60 amps or more of power
per hour. High-amperage appliances like air conditioning, electric
ovens, and electric water heaters use massive amounts of power when
running, so whole-home backup is not realistic with today’s battery
and inverter technology. What the right system can do is keep your
lights and your critical appliances on long enough to get you through
a blackout and have your solar panels recharge your battery the next
day"</p>
