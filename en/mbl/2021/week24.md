We can certainly fix the BEV problem -- by abandoning the shoddy tech.

"Hybrid electric vehicles [like FCEVs] contain approximately 85 pounds
[of copper].. battery electric vehicles (BEVs) contain 183 pounds"

---

Copper is used heavily in panels, turbines; not much we can do there (unless
we find pure chemical, photosynthesis-like process to generate H2 direct),
but we can fix the grid problem. 

---

Another reason to de-electrify and *not* use a grid for energy transportation

"[G]rid energy storage installations rely on between 3 tons and 4 tons [of copper] per MW"

---

Copper shortfall? Damn

30s nationalism was beaten through war in Europe. TR branch wiggled
its way out of that loss.. They hid in the cracks of the society,
occasionally getting out and messing shit up. Zionists were already
well protected behind their shield of victimization, they could not be
criticized for anything, in fear of being called anti-Semite. That is
at least two countries today who harbor a rotten form of nationalism,
a kind that long should have been swept away.

Aha.. USS RR was near Japan, data is a month old. So it sailed to SCS

NYT: "Even as NATO leaders met in Brussels, the American aircraft
carrier Ronald Reagan and several other warships moved into the
disputed waters of the South China Sea, with the group’s commander,
Rear Adm. Will Pennington, vowing to protect 'international law and
rules-based order,' wording that echoed NATO’s communiqué. Hours later
[.. CH] conducted their own show of force over waters south of Taiwan,
the island democracy that China claims as its own. Only days before,
the Group of 7 leaders, meeting in Cornwall, England, had for the
first time issued a statement on Taiwan"

[Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/world/asia/china-nato-military.html)

---

Data can be noisy or missing (report delays, etc); so you try to piece
it together from clues. An aircraft carrier (code CVN) never travels
alone, it is accompanied by destroyers (code DG), and guided missile
cruisers (code CG). So CG and DG presence can indicate a larger deployment.

---

Presence around South China Sea is more visible, on both ends, near
Japan, and Vietnam / Singapore.

---

Navy location map update. Added more destroyers, and guided missile
cruisers.

Zionism also carries the residue of the 30s. They were crushed by that
nationalism, but in a bizarre reversal, they assumed it (the tortured
imitating the torturer), and under the protective shield of their
victimization nursed it to this day.

there".

"[S]ince 1999, when Hugo Chavez ushered in a socialist revolution,
Venezuela allowed the [Colombian] rebels to use its territory in their
fight against the Colombian government, which is a U.S. ally. Under
Colombia's 2016 peace agreement, most of the rebels disarmed, but some
refused. And many of these guerrillas are thought to be smuggling
Colombian cocaine through Venezuela in cahoots with the Venezuelan
army. McDermott claims the fighting broke out when one guerrilla
faction tried to bypass the Venezuelan military and keep most or all
of the cocaine profits"

No recall elections. No issue voting. No referandums. No direct
democracy, until such time new tech / system does something
drastically different, not merely slaps some wizbang appendage on the
existing system which is not built for such granular
interaction. Current system should be (mostly is) centered around the
representatives.

No. Bcz I dont support issue voting in general.

"Would you support ranked choice voting on issues"

---

Great.. this new approach would also carry the legitimacy of a runoff
IMO. 

Politico: "Voting kicks off in a New York City mayor's race.. Voters
are trying out ranked-choice voting for the first time... The new
voting system [.. is] a way to avoid the cost and low turnout of
runoff elections. If no one wins a majority, then the last-place
finisher is eliminated and the second-place votes from those ballots
are redistributed to the remaining field. The process repeats itself
until someone breaks the 50 percent barrier"
