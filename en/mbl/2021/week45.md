Al Jazeera: "US, Israel, UAE, Bahrain launch joint naval drills in Red
Sea.. The training focuses on maritime “visit, board, search and

Thursday"

Some object to the inclusion of Philippines, India .. Both of these
countries have enough institutional support for a democracy. Their
leaders are criticized but Philippines President does not plan to
remain in the job for life, in fact he regularly complains about the
job and talked about quitting more than once.

"President Joe Biden is getting ready to deliver on a key campaign
promise by convening a Summit for Democracy.. Representation from the
Middle East was slim with Israel and Iraq among the few countries
invited and notable U.S. allies such as Egypt and NATO partner Turkey
absent from the list"

NYT: "[A Sicilian town Floridia] is perhaps the most blisteringly hot

---

The EU countries could buy solar produced clean gas from Africa, but
also from a country of their own, Italy. Remember that [news](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/world/europe/sicily-heat-wave-record-temperature-floridia-italy.html)
abt that Sicilian town, when it got really hot during the summer.
Hell put an SBD, or CSP installation there, ship H2.

---

An electric grid cannot store power like an H2 grid can. Electrons are
too fickle, the moment voltage at the endpoints go away (generation
stops), there is no current. But if new gas stopped flowing into a gas
network, there would still be gas remaining in the pipes. Gas
molecules have substance, they have a physical existence without the
presence of potential difference on either end. For the gas, if
generation stopped, one can still push the remaining gas out through
midpoint stations.

Graph was flat for a while but then it shot up again starting 2005.
That must be the so-called "US Shale Revolution". Natural gas
production skyrocketed in US, and so the leaks, flaring, etc.

What are those little bumps? That is probably methane of decades
earlier disappearing (methane can expire much earlier than
carbon). But we keep putting more in, so the trend is up.

chemical fuels that can be used to power our grids, store our

Why did Rudolph Diesel not continue with ammonia engines? Production
of NH3 in huge amounts was probably a factor. Refining crude oil,
especially of a certain kind, isn't too hard.  But that was a long
time ago, we had a long time to work on ammonia production tech, plus
there is new urgency around the issue.

---

I read about that; it is apparently an ammonia based combustion
engine. 100% clean, zero emissions.

"Fortescue is undertaking to deliver several key projects... These
projects include: Developing a ship design powered by green ammonia
and trialing that design in new ammonia engine technology, at

Reflecting, or redirecting sunlight through lenses can give immense

Excerpt from [The Rare Metals War](../../2021/10/the-rare-metals-war.html#ref1).

---

H2 pipelines, ammonia, CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) plants do not
require rare earth materials.  All you need for CSP is glass and steel
to make mirrors which is known tech and resources for it are
abundant. Efficiency at 30% equals solar panel tech.

"The current global supply of several critical metals is insufficient
to transition to a renewable energy system. [..P]roduction of wind
turbines and photovoltaic (PV) solar panels already requires a
significant share of the annual global production of some critical
metals. Looking at the global scale, scenarios in line with the goals
of the Paris Agreement require the global production of some metals to
grow at least twelvefold towards 2050, compared to today’s
output. Specifically, the demand for neodymium, terbium, indium,
dysprosium, and praseodymium stands out. This calculation does not
include the demand for these specific metals in other applications,
such as electric vehicles or consumer electronics"

"[W]hereas greenhouse gases force the climate system in the warming
direction, aerosols force the system in the cooling direction because
the airborne particles scatter and absorb incoming sunlight.

[Climate researcher Hansen believes to] power [the] large-scale [post
WWII] expansion of industry, Europeans and Americans burned an
enormous quantity of fossil fuels.. In addition to carbon dioxide,
burning fossil fuel produces particulate matter—including soot and
light-colored sulfate aerosols. Hansen suspects the relatively sudden,
massive output of aerosols from industries and power plants
contributed to the global cooling trend from 1940-1970.

'That’s my suggestion, though it’s still not proven,' [Hansen]
said. 'There is a nice record of sulfates ..  that shows this type of
particle was peaking in the atmosphere around 1970. And then the ice
core record shows a rapid decline in sulfates, right about the time
nations began regulating their emission.' (Sulfates cause acid rain
and other health and environmental problems.)"

---

Yes between 40-70s there was a brief cooling in climate; but this
happened partly due to an action hard to replicate. We need to fix the
root of the problem, through clean fuels.

---

Got to play with 🐍 package `netcdf4`, can be useful later. Lots of
