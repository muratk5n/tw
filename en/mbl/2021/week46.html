<p>Business Insider: "Some of them call it 'antiwork.' It's a trend
bolstered by younger workers, as Gen Zers make their mark on the labor
market. In America, it looks similar to similar youth-led movements
against work in other countries, especially China, where young people
are 'lying flat' by decentering a drive to constantly be more
productive and competitive at work, and instead find happiness in
their own lives and relaxation.</p>
<p>A rising disillusion with the state of work has spawned millions of
Larrys over the last year. People have been quitting their jobs at
record rates for six months in a row now — and many aren't going
back. That's because, for some, work doesn't seem to be worth it
anymore. Wages have been on the decline for decades while student debt
rises. The number of people with low-wage jobs has grown since the
Great Recession , as salaries that support a middle-class life have
cratered"</p>

<p>If supply probs persist, that could be a way to encourage folks to
consume less. On wages, when similar problems surfaced during the
<a href="https://youtu.be/8rxrjhWTdv8?t=27">70s</a> developed world panicked,
"went to China", production skyrocketed through slave labor, at the
same time, wages stagnated and in US ppl started dying from
opioids... Let's not repeat that mistake.  If wages increase "more
than necessary" that is an internal politics fight, and let's have it,
with trade unions, politicians etc. In the meantime cannot find a Mr
Potatohead toy? Use a potato and make one</p>

<p>Expanding existing infra for the shiny product obviously makes the
overall approach even stupider. Gov had to lead, not follow bunch of
salesmen.</p>
<hr />
<p>Even then, the BEV was considered as a ridiculous solution by many for
a long time, but as the drums of climate apocalypse became louder,
some started to think "maybe to avert that crazy end, I do need this
dumb-ass shit". A strange way to land at a conclusion, and of course,
faulty. Shoulda asked for better infra</p>
<hr />
<p>The world became too used to solving problems throught those little,
shiny products, coming from the private sector, having been
brainwashed by neoliberalism.. Such products are stand-alone units of
goods that can be sold, expected to work on their own, assuming
certain infra backdrop.. nothing more.</p>
<p>Climate cannot be solved with such isolated trinkets. This is how an
inferior tech, the battery electric car, became en vogue, that
singular product trying to exist in a certain environment (the wall
plug). New and different infrastructure could have changed the
underlying Calculus completely, much earlier.</p>
<hr />
<p>The word Istanbul comes from the Greek word Stanpoli, it means "in the

baseless, crooked fabrication.</p>
<hr />
<p>Climate activists on air quality of Stanpoli, Asia Minor; they say the
smog seen there recently was pollution, not harmless mist... I've been
checking the pollution levels through OWM, half the time I see AQI at

<p>Marmite is extremely potent. It's like condensed Guiness.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fantastic history to all these things. Fine innovation.</p>
<p>Wiki: "The product that was to become Marmite was invented during the
late 19th century when German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered
that brewer's yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten...  By
1912, the discovery of vitamins was a boost for Marmite, as the spread
is a rich source of the vitamin B complex; with the vitamin B1
deficiency beriberi being common during World War I, the spread became
more popular. British troops during World War I were issued Marmite as
part of their rations"</p>

<p>Centrism got its ass kicked in Virginia. Trump derangement, running
specifically against Trump didn't work. Not being able to hit the
opponent on Carlyle, like a leftist could, then getting mired in
culture war like a 90s centrist Clintonite destroyed the guy. I loved
it.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was fitting that the first crisis in Clinton WH was a hot-button
social issue, not an economic issue. For econ they'd do NAFTA and
everyone was on board for that, except that one weird guy with the
squeky voice.. In a debate on the subject Perot (that weird guy with
the squeky voice) would argue against, Gore wld argue for, and one of
the "eminent characters" Gore would pull out of his bag to support his
case would be Powell. He was apparently for NAFTA -- and why wouldn't
he be? He was a Republican.</p>

spotted a red flag to relying on solar panels as a panacea for global
emissions problems. Experts have found that the rare metals required

sufficient supply to keep up with demand... Currently, China is
providing the world.. Yet [CH] is no longer abundant with precious

<p>Electrons are fickle.. Must base the new energy system on things with

<p>"The advantage of the thermal reflector systems is that because they
initially produce heat, this heat can be stored, and it’s an important
consideration if you need to produce electricity after
sunset. Photovoltaic panels, on the other hand, produce electricity
immediately, making storing electricity less efficient. The Negev
Energy project uses a molten salt storage system that enables it to
hold and provide additional 4.5 hours of clean energy each day, at
full capacity, even after sunset or during cloudy days"</p>

suddenly, Americans can’t spend like they used to. Store shelves are
emptying, and it can take months to find a car, refrigerator or
sofa. If this continues, we may need to learn to do without — and,
horrors, live more like the Europeans. That actually might not be a
bad thing, because the U.S. economy could be healthier if it were less
