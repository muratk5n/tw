# Week 3

Combining H2 with CO2 (from the "air") to create synthetic kerosone,
so overall you are carbon neutral (took from air, goes back to air, no
difference)? Too open to cheating.. They'll take CO2 from f-ing
whereever, and slap a "neutral" label on it. Before VW cheating
scandal I might have supported these neutrality schemes, now, no.. The
best way to go green is commiting to it at end-user level, you
regulate the source (or make it completely green as well) then the
rest is safe.

Not bad this powerbank has a builtin camp light, can be charged
through my panels, its 2A output runs Raspberry Pi and Im guessing 3A
output will even run a NVidia dev board. With $30 HDMI portable
monitor the whole package is as good as a notebook.

$f(x,p,t)$ is the *probability* of finding particle in certain phase

H2 has no problems on the weight front (only some on volume) equiv
energy in H2 is actually *lighter*.

---

Li-on bats are 1.8 MJ/liter, so they arent even in the running. Plus
they weigh a ton, plane will nose dive, that way 👎

---

Airbus A330 has a range of 11,750 km. If you halve that, can still
cross the Atlantic which is around 5,000 km.

Crossing the Pacific.. at ~ 7,000 km (LA-Tokyo), bit harder, refuel at
Alaska? Or increase tank size little more.. Solutions can be found.

---

How to solve the green aviation problem?

Current jet fuel used is kerosene (one of the most densest form of
energy) w energy content 34.69 MJ/litre.

Liquified H2 has 8.5 MJ/liter

Then a suggestion could be, pending new developments, double fuel tank
size, and halve the range of planes. Dunno what else to say, greening
will have consequences. But I am guessing if sufficient fire is lit
under their ass, aircraft makers will innovate in a jif. Airbus chief
is [lighting](https://twitter.com/GuillaumeFaury/status/1280846469680050176)
that fire I see (or feeling it), he laid out a goal, so subseq inno
should be possible.

[shakes head in disbelief]

Unzicker: "The reason why the standard model cannot calculate mass is
stunningly simple. Whatever formula may calculate the mass of a
particle, it has to have the physical unit of a mass, which is
kilograms, and those kilograms have to come out of the formula, you
can't pull it out of your ass. The only way to do it is to find
combinations of the fundamental constants of Nature, otherwise you are
cheating. But there is no such combination, as every high school kid
can understand... There is just one caveat - you can't do it unless
you use the gravitational constant G, that is, you consider gravity in
your model. But particle physicists don’t do it because gravity is a
difficult business that goes above their minds. It’s outright lunatic
that they declare that calculating masses, alas, is impossible in the
standard model and at the same time deliberately disregard gravity
which would offer the only possibility to try it"

"[Wilczek] has by now lost multiple bets that the LHC would see SUSY
particles, including ones with Garrett Lisi in 2009 and Tord Ekelöf in 2012.
At this point, even diehards like Wilczek acknowledge that
chances that the LHC will see SUSY are slim. Another problem is that
increasingly sensitive proton decay experiments have also ruled out a
large part of the proton lifetimes predicted by the SUSY models
Wilczek favors"

Boeing did not only mess up on the control system of the MAX. They
messed up in the core aerodynamics first, they created a poorly
balanced plane, which they tried to fix using software. They made it
much easier for the control system to fail, basically.

People are awed and amazed at the electronics of these systems, but
let's not forget, during WW1 and and 2, planes could still fly without
any of these. Basic, solid aerodynamics made that possible. Now bunch
of office monkeys too used to their gadgetry and unrealistic computer
games think they can turn everything upside down, and "software" wld
take care of it. This is delusional / wishful thinking. This is the
mentality that gave you stagnant physics of decades, BEVs, IoT, errant
liberalism and lukewarm, ineffective politics with tech sparkle.

TR parties, coalitions still largely work this way.. they are
cesspools of proto fascism into which anything can be thrown in and it
floats, like certain shit does in a pool of piss.

---

Sure. 30s TR for example, during the single-party rule and staunch
nationalism one of its governors was known to have said "if communism
was necessary for this country, we would surely import it". Sounds
like a joke and it is told as such, but the guy was dead
serious. There you go, nationalist talking about utilizing
communism.. Or in China today, they are communists, but imported
capitalism, and happily using it. Italian fascists created the social
security system of the country.

Intensely opposing ideologies cannot be held together under one roof
in anything other than fascism.. A whatever-it-takes attitude usually
accompanies the approach, 4 whatever reason said country falls into a
state-of-emergency mentality from which they never emerge, so they
keep on living in an hand-to-mouth existence, "I'll take from here,
I'll take from there, whatever-it-takes, ends-justify-the-means", and
on it goes..
