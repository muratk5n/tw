<p>It has to be due to the vacuum on top of the airfoil... The shape
blocks flow from getting there directly, which creates briefly (but
repeatedly, due to forward movement) a vacuum meaning lower
pressure. There is higher pressure below, ergo lift. Increase angle of
attack, there is even more pressure below, molecules are directly
hitting airfoil now. At the right angle, in a sweet spot avoiding
stall, you get lift.</p>

<p>Great example of putting capitalism on a leash. Left to their own
devices (!) companies would not converge to the same standard,
everyone, especially established players, would have an incentive to
lock people in to their own charger mechanism. But that leads to
waste.  Capitalism can optimize for certain things, but not
necessarilly for grander goals, eg resource usage, material footprint
on the planet, or even consumer's benefit, in a larger ecosystem. If a
person needs to own three chargers for three devices, that is huge
amount of waste, consumer is not served well either. There is metal in
there that needs to be mined somewhere, plastic that requires fossil
fuels refinery. Governance steps in, tunes the whole thing.</p>

<p>Could be GA.. The BTC code was officially turned over to his upkeep,
the last email sent from SN was to GA. His psych profile suggests an
overdeveloped sense of justice, seeing a lot of people wronged by the
finance system could push a person like that to act. Theres leadership
ability; being able to entice people to work in orgs, etc -- crucial
for an open-source project. Background suggests he would have more
knowledge than others (in that BTC group) on projects crafted for the

issue, she said, was that most Russians fear getting involved in
politics because of the country’s bloody history. As a result, she
said, people with access to the levers of power easily take advantage
of those who don’t. 'Because of these huge cataclysms that happened to
their families, people realized that nothing depends on them, on
little people,' Ms. Makarova said. 'You will survive if you do not
interfere.'"</p>

single-party rule needed the "secondary" issues to be radicalized. To
that end Reps could always point to a libertarian to justify these
extreme positions, 'look these guys over there are against it, gun
control is too much government, climate protection is, well, too much
government, and they are quoting some 18 century jagoff, so they must
have a point"..</p>
<p>Libertarians are the useful idiots in this picture bcz they would

instead they became tools to blunt the visible stupidity of the
culture war, providing the much needed ideological paintjob.</p>
