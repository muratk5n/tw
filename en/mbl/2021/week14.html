<p>"After the United Kingdom left the European Union at the start of this
year, checks and tariffs were introduced on some goods moving from
mainland Britain to Northern Ireland as the province now borders the
bloc via EU member Ireland.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had promised there would be no
hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland as result of Brexit,
and unfettered trade between the province and the rest of the United
Kingdom would continue.</p>
<p>But critics of the departure deal's Northern Ireland Protocol say a
border is now in effect in the Irish Sea, leaving unionists, who want
to stay in the United Kingdom, feeling betrayed"</p>

<p>"[I]n 1965, NASA funded a project to develop a general-purpose finite
element program by a group in California led by Dick MacNeal. This
program, which came to be known as NASTRAN, included a large array of
capabilities, such as two- and three-dimensional stress analyses, beam
and shell elements, for analyzing complex structures, such as
airframes, and analysis of vibrations and time-dependent response to
dynamic loads. NASA funded this project with 3 [mil] (like 30 [mil]
today). The initial program was put in the public domain, but it had
many bugs. Shortly after the completion of the program, Dick MacNeal
and Bruce McCormick started a software firm that fixed most of the
bugs and marketed the program to industry. By 1990, the program was
the workhorse of most large industrial firms and the company,
MacNeal-Schwendler, was a $100 million company"</p>

<hr />
<p>"In a nutshell, the natural geological process of scrubbing carbon
dioxide from the air works like this: carbon dioxide dissolves into
rainwater, which then falls on rocks. Over time, rocks absorb carbon
dioxide, consuming the gas and creating a mineral-based bicarbonate
akin to baking soda that gets washed into the ocean. As effective as
it may be, it’s also a glacially slow process that can take hundreds
of centuries, Kelland notes. 'We don’t have 100,000 years to fix this
problem,' he says. 'How can we speed that process up? Effectively,
that's what our process does.' Planetary Hydrogen’s patented system,
dubbed SeaOH2, uses an electric current to split ocean water molecules
into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>Known as electrolysis, that process isn’t groundbreaking in
itself. But by adding a mineral salt to the electrolysis cell, the
company’s engineers have created an atmosphere-scrubbing compound
called mineral hydroxide as a waste product. The hydroxide binds with
carbon dioxide, effectively “capturing' the greenhouse gas while
producing hydrogen as a potentially lucrative byproduct"</p>
