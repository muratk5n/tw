Turchin, *End Times*: "Where is China today? Pretty much where it has
been for the past two thousand years. It is governed by a ruling class
of bureaucrats. The acronym CPC, which stands for the Communist Party
of China, might as well stand for the Confucian Party of
China.. Throughout Chinese imperial history, the mandarins kept the
merchant class on a short leash, and the same is true for the Red
dynasty. On [2021] Xi Jinping, gave a major speech in which he called
for common prosperity and emphasized the need to regulate excessively
high-income groups, which was interpreted by the Western press as an
attack on the rich. But there is ​nothing new here, merely the
mandarins (again) reminding the billionaires who is in charge in
China"

Good evening, Tech Threads. Today was a big milestone in our quest to
federate \#Flipboard and tear down the walls around our own walled
garden. First, we launched a new version of Flipboard for iOS and
Android which brings the promise of two way federation to life. Now
when a federated Flipboard user curates, people in the fediverse (soon
to include threads users!) can reply, favorite, boost or follow those
Flipboard users who in turn will see that activity in their usual
notifications tab. Even better, Flipboard users can now directly reply
to people in the fediverse"

NYT: "A Tantalizing ‘Hint’ That Astronomers Got Dark Energy All
Wrong.. The first year of [a new spectroscopic instrument's] results
were designed to simply confirm what was already known..  'We thought
that we would basically validate the standard model.' But the unknown
leaped out at them. When the scientists combined their map with other
cosmological data, they were surprised to find that it did not quite
agree with the otherwise reliable standard model of the universe,
which assumes that dark energy is constant and unchanging. A varying
dark energy fit the data points better"

BTW according to a theory, Watergate was part of what some call a
"Camelot conspiracy", the Kennedys were behind the whole
thing. Matthews talks about in the book how Ted Ken used the
opportunity to damage Nixon as a member of the Judiciary Commitee,
perhaps there was more going on behind the scenes as well. The
military-industrial complex liked JFK anyway who constantly raised
their budget, an MIC/Camelot effort would not be outside the realm of
possibility.

Vanden Heuvel, *The Nation*: "Ties between the government and the

spent went to for-profit defense contractors. Dozens of members of
Congress and their spouses own millions of dollars’ worth of stock in

Author Michael Easter says along with long-distance travel carrying is
also a fundamental human skill. The human body is built the way it is
so that "we could slowly but surely run down prey for miles and miles
in the heat until the animal toppled over from exhaustion". Then we’d
hunt it and carry it back to camp. This is why we have two legs, sweat
glands across our body, no fur, short torsos, and strong grips. IOW
rucking is cool. Be a rucker, not a mucker.

Nick Bano: "[The root of a lot of the high rent problems] goes back to
Margaret Thatcher and to Tony Blair because of course while it's right
to point out that Thatcher dismantled rent controls what kept the
landlords in check for most of the 20th century was that they were
scared that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords Labor would
come and turn it around again. When you have a long-term investment
like land that tended to keep the landlords at Bay a bit. So when Tony
Blair said rent controls are never coming back "I'm keeping what that
Thatcher had", that signals to the landlords to go wild"

Third way (not to be confused with third wave) was a faux philophical
cover for the left to act like right-wingers under a slick new
label. It was an unplanned, clumsy mess and along with the problem
leaving huge swaths of ideological spectrum unattended it naturally
caused chaos, and in the long-term (today) misery. But since the
proponents who pushed this ideology were also creating crises at the
same time they could conveniently look like heroes fighting them with
their half-assed band-aid solutions. The approach was ineffective, but
during the post Berlin Wall euphoria many did not care, mostly
chalking up the problems to the birth pangs of something new. It was
nothing new, it was something old. Rich getting richer poor getting
poorer.

---

The Nation: "British Prime Minister Tony Blair euphorically announced
[90s], third-way thinking was.. [a] governing philosophy for the
future... The third way.. proved instrumental to another key post–Cold
War undertaking: discrediting and marginalizing movement-based
coalitions on the left, stigmatizing them as holdovers from the
recently resolved—in capitalism’s favor—postwar clash of
ideologies. In many ways, the most lasting legacy of the third way may
well be its determination to consign the political left to the dustbin
of history, setting the stage for the new millennial age of reaction
and crisis"

For one transgression they blockaded Greece? Those were the days. Now
they would give Greece more weapons.

Unherd: "In 1847 David Pacifico, a British subject resident in Athens,
had his home stormed by a mob... As that happened, the Athenian police
did nothing. Pacifico immediately wrote to the British authorities in
Greece to explain what had taken place. In turn they approached the
Greek government asking Pacifico to be compensated. Athens refused to
do anything — twice. As a result Lord Palmerston, then Foreign
Secretary, instructed Sir William Parker, Commander-in-Chief of the
Mediterranean Fleet, to impose a blockade of Athens and requisition
the country’s navy"

Looking at the passage [here](../../2024/04/end-times-turchin.html), it
becomes clear US libertarianism is not some extreme ideology for the
Anglo-centric folk.

"[T]hanks to its protected position in the British Isles, once England
conquered all of them, it could, and did, dispense with the standing
army.. The squirearchy, which started as a military class, gradually
lost its military character.. The early American Republic was an
oligarchy modeled after the United Kingdom".

Libertarians are against most things military, and are for extreme
free trade, right? Well those wishes have their basis in the the Anglo
past. Dispensing with the standing army, check. Plutocracy, check.

Now there are negatives associated with that. The region specific,
local roots makes libertarianism less universal. It has bizarre
hangups some of which are vaguely applicable to today, some not. It is
excessively against anything military, that would be good for
curtailing excessive mil spending and defang the military-industrial
complex, but can we reach a just and equitable society out of such a
British Isles centric ideology? Uncurtailed capitalism is at the root
of many ills today. I'm afraid its past makes this ideology a bit
provencial, marginal.

"@GeePawHill@mastodon.social

One of the key facts here keeps getting sidestepped by a mixture of
scam marketing and common language usage out there.

LLMs don't *sometimes* make shit up, they *always* make shit up.

That's what an LLM *is*: a piece of software that makes up plausible
sounding shit.

What's impressive about this is the extent of improvement in the
plausibility.

What's horrifying about it is the extent to which so many people don't
care to distinguish between plausibility and correctness"

One of the 1000 ways the top 1% can avoid tax.. 

"The 'Buy, Borrow, Die' strategy has been adopted by affluent
individuals who enlist the aid of financial planning specialists to
maintain their lavish lifestyles while minimizing taxes... First, a
wealthy person must have a high amount of wealth and use that wealth
to buy assets... After acquiring assets that will appreciate, the next
logical step is to take out loans secured by these assets. In other
words, those resources can be utilized as collateral for borrowed
money. Instead of selling your investments for cash and triggering
capital gains taxes, you could borrow money by pledging your assets as
a surety. Not only are you not liable for capital gains tax, but the
loan proceeds will not be taxable income... [after death] those
receiving your estate can use the assets you have bequeathed to settle
any loans... [the heirs] pay zero taxes under current law. Or they
could use the buy, borrow, die strategy on the inherited assets and
repeat the cycle"

Paper: "Did Austerity Cause Brexit?.. The fiscal contraction brought
about by the Conservative-led government starting in 2010 was sizable:
aggregate real government spending on welfare and social protection
decreased by around 16 percent per capita. At the district level, the
level at which most administration of welfare spending takes place,
welfare spending per person fell by 23.4 percent in real terms between
2010 and 2015.. Using data from government estimates on the expected
intensity of specific welfare cuts across districts, I show that
support for UKIP started to grow in areas with significant exposure to
specific benefit cuts after these became effective"

OnLabor: "[01/30] SpaceX and Trader Joe’s are attacking the
constitutionality of the [National Labor Relations Board]. While their
arguments may be novel, their strategy is not. After the Wagner Act’s
passage in 1935, employers across the country openly flouted the law,
arguing that it was unconstitutional. They had reason to think the
Supreme Court might agree: it had previously struck
down wage and hour laws and defended yellow-dog contracts in the name
of the Constitution. More recently, the Court had stymied President
Roosevelt’s early attempts to regulate labor relations by voiding the
National Industrial Recovery Act. But the Lochner era drew to a close
after Roosevelt’s threats to pack the Court, and the justices
finally upheld the NLRB’s constitutionality in 1937.

Undaunted by the many decades of intervening precedent, today’s
employers are once again ignoring labor law in hopes of capitalizing
on a sympathetic judiciary"

Although pro-rich ideology derived some benefits from TS doing cool
things, he was nevertheless portrayed as a faulty man so naturally he
would side with the government for the accords, the central theme of
*Civil War*. TS death / sacrifice at the end was his redemption for
the mistakes he'd made previously. For being vengeful perhaps
(attacking a friend for avenging the death of his parents), being a
jackass, showoff in general, even creating a killerbot by mistake.

The real hero of the saga, the unblemished examplar of the previous
phases was Cap. He has honor, is cool, he is always on the "right
side". He is so deserving of that mystic mojo he can lift Thor's
hammer because he is that freaking great (a twist set up like 10
movies earlier, in *Age of Ultron*, it paid off in *Endgame*). And that
guy, the shit, the man with "America's Ass" chose to be
anti-government when the government asked him to sign an accord that
wasn't even slightly offensive. The studios planted a subliminal
message this way, they said government is no good, if it were, Captain
America would be on their side (so remember that viewer when they come
to tax our corporation one day, wink wink, you have to be
anti-government like Steve Rodgers, so you too can have that mojo -and
we continue paying no tax-).

NYT: "[2020/03] A $60 Billion Housing Grab by Wall Street.. By 2016,
95 percent of the distressed mortgages on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s
books were auctioned off to Wall Street investors without any
meaningful stipulations, and private-equity firms had acquired more
than 200,000 homes in desirable cities and middle-class suburban
neighborhoods, creating a tantalizing new asset class: the
single-family-rental home. The companies would make money on rising
home values while tenants covered the mortgages...

Wall Street’s latest real estate grab has ballooned to roughly $60
billion, representing hundreds of thousands of properties. In some
communities, it has fundamentally altered housing ecosystems in ways
we’re only now beginning to understand, fueling a housing recovery
without a homeowner recovery"

"Google Is Killing.. Independent Sites.. Since September 2023, Google

Google’s spokespersons replying with cover-up quotes such as 'make

Google continuously states (and very publicly) that their goal is to
show helpful content, to reduce spam, and make the search results
fairer to all sized websites. But the opposite is happening, and
aggressively. Google’s algorithms now favor a handful of results
BEFORE 'normal' websites, results that rarely show independent
websites..

Google wants to completely eradicate users leaving their search
results and will now show you their own 'From Sources' answers to
search terms. These answers are taken without consent from the
publisher’s content and are stolen from creators’ work so that Google

ML Street Talk Podcast: "[I]f you look at, the AI Day presentations
that effectively go into deep technical detail about how Tesla learns
the world, or Andrei's talk at NeurIPS 2 years ago.. Tesla very much
is trying to come up with a function that memorizes the
world.. basically take all of the possible perceptual states that
exist in the realm of driving, and produce the correct perceptual
signals, that result from that, under all circumstances. And they're
pouring massive amounts of training data and making that happen,
running.. tests in shadow mode to collect, triggers that then feed
more labels, back to the labeling team to run that data loop.

[The aim seems to be..] that singularity moment where the function
converges and and has memorized infinity. And.. as, you know, I've
kind of talked to you about, so far, I do not believe that that's
possible.. Obviously, neural networks are finite machines. They
operate under finite compute constraints with finite memory. It may be
possible to build a neural network, that could indeed memorize
infinity given, an infinite number of layers and infinite number of,
you know, fully connected neurons, infinite compute and memory to
execute that model. But given the compute constraints in a Tesla
vehicle, I don't think that's possible to achieve"

The "rebels" who do not like the rules are like intrepid

diverse, fluid binary or whatever.. Starfleet is like government, of
course it is painted as bad because the corps who fund these shows
prefer it, they are scared of any insitution that is not theirs, and
is capable to tax their ass one day.

It seems they emphasized the usual message via subliminal parallels
btw Starfleet and Government, brainwashing against the essence of
both. Anti-government, pro-corporate ideology..

The Bulwark: "What does it mean if we can’t even trust the
institutions in our imagined utopias?.. Starfleet, for those not also
raised on Star Trek, is the exploratory, scientific, diplomatic, and
military arm of the United Federation of Planets.. But whatever else
Starfleet is, it is *good*.. Things are different in modern Trek [Jar
Jar Ibrahim era]... Starfleet as an institution often plays a
partially antagonistic role in [newer] shows. By the time of *Picard*,
the titular paragon has quit Starfleet in a huff because it no longer
lives up to his principles, and in both seasons one and three it is
revealed that Starfleet has been compromised by hostile alien agents
and cannot be trusted. The first season of *Discovery* ends with
Starfleet condoning genocide, only to be stopped by our heroic crew;
Season 2’s villain was an out-of-control Starfleet AI that threatened
all life in the galaxy; and Seasons 3 and 4 keep the crew in
near-constant conflict with Starfleet and/or Federation brass. *Lower
Decks* is centered on the adventures of a low-level officer who
routinely defies Starfleet regulations to help nearby planets in ways
that Starfleet would not condone. Even *Strange New Worlds*, the most
archetypal of the modern shows, emphasizes how unjust some of
Starfleet’s rules are"

Scientific American: "[2022] JWST's First Glimpses of Early Galaxies

candidates.. sprang into view with estimated redshifts as high as
20—just 180 million years after the big bang—some with disklike
structures that were not expected to manifest so early in cosmic
history... Such behemoths emerging so rapidly defies expectations set
by cosmologists' standard model of the universe's evolution. In the
first second after the [so called] big bang, our universe was an
almost inconceivably hot and dense soup of primordial
particles... This process of becoming, of the early universe's chaos
giving way to the more orderly cosmos we know today, is thought to
have taken about a billion years. JWST's discovery of bright galaxies
in the early cosmos challenges this model"
