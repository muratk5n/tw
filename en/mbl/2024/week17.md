'AI is here to stay'

Generative models are horrendously expensive and, at best—once you
factor in the need to safety and reliability—give you a productivity
boost at tasks most businesses value less than the crud in the coffee
maker (clip art, email, meetings, boilerplate code.. I’m on the record
as saying that these systems are too risky to use in dev for anything
other than prototypes so don’t come at me with 'oh, but coding')

The notion that it’s here to stay is entirely contingent upon a number
of fairly unlikely events:

- Costs drop by several orders of magnitude

- Environmental impact drops similarly

- Speed improves dramatically

- A completely new invention makes it reliable and safe

And it’s just as likely that the hypothetical completely new more
'reliable and safe' thing would be different enough for all of your
investments in current era models to crash in value and become an
active hindrance"

99% of tech social media:

'I like this thing, but people say it’s bad so here is a list of
self-serving reasons why I should be allowed to like it. They’re my
soothing koans to calm the phantom pain of my long-amputated
conscience'

'No, none of them actually address the criticism. Why do you ask?'

You can have a tech that is mostly used for fraud, bankrupts the
elderly, or even literally kills people, but tech enthusiasts will
defend it by saying it saves five minutes on their morning breakfast
routine.. 

It’s a worldview where individual benefit, no matter how trivial,
trumps societal harm. There’s no arguing with people who respond to
'this will destroy lives' with: 'but I find it useful'"

Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] Despite the fact that oil companies nowadays
view war and political turmoil in the Middle East as detrimental to
their long-term interests and, therefore, do not support policies that
are conducive to war and militarism, and despite the fact that war is
no longer the way to gain access to cheap oil, the widespread
perception that every U.S. military engagement in the region,
including the current invasion of Iraq, is prompted by oil
considerations continues. The question is why?..

[T]he major reason for the persistence of this pervasive perception
seems to stem from certain deliberate efforts that are designed to
perpetuate the myth in order to camouflage some real economic and
geopolitical special interests that drive the U.S. military adventures
in the Middle East. There is evidence that both the
military-industrial complex and militant Zionist proponents of
'greater Israel' disingenuously use oil as a U.S. 'national interest
issue' in order to disguise their own nefarious special interests and
objectives: justification of continued expansion of military spending,
extension of sales markets for the products of war and war-related
industries, and recasting the geopolitical map of the Middle East
according to the designs of hard-line Zionism.  Evidence indicates
that for every dollar’s worth of oil imported from the Persian Gulf
region the Pentagon takes $5 out of the federal budget to 'secure' the
flow of that oil! This is a clear indication that the claim that the
U.S. military presence in the Middle East is due to oil consideration
is a fraud"

Getting slammed by North Korea - a new low. There is a lot of truth in
what they say.

TASS: "The situation in Ukraine serves the interests of the US
military-industrial complex and the administration of President Joe
Biden, both profiting greatly from the conflict, North Korean Deputy
Foreign Minister for Russia Im Chon Il said. '..at least a third of
the $60 billion US military aid to Ukraine remains in the US to
replenish the army's equipment and ammunition. This once again
blatantly reveals the cunning and despicable nature of the 'helping
hand' the US offers to Ukraine with its military aid. Its goal is to
use the Ukrainian conflict to serve the interests of the US military
monopolies and at the same time to subjugate the puppet regime of
[Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky.. ' the diplomat said in a
statement quoted by the Korean Central News Agency. 'It is not
surprising that experts assess that it is the US that is reaping the
maximum benefit from the situation in Ukraine, and the Biden
administration is drinking "blood wine" and receiving large revenues,'
the deputy foreign minister said"

Advanced Science News: "Researchers from the University of Nottingham
have discovered that the surface of swarf, the waste metal ringlets
discarded by the metal machining industry, is textured at a nanoscale
level in a way that boosts the catalysis [for H2 electrolysis]
reducing the need for rare metals.

The authors of the study, published in the Journal of Material
Chemistry A, claim it overcomes two major challenges. “Firstly, it
enables the production of green hydrogen using the least amount of
precious metal possible, and secondly, it upcycles metal waste from
the aerospace industry, all in a single process,” said one of the
study’s authors, Andrei Khlobystov"

Rowan Atkinson, The Guardian: "[2023/06] Electric motoring is, in
theory, a subject about which I should know something. My first
university degree was in electrical and electronic engineering, with a
subsequent master’s in control systems.. In advance of the Cop26
climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, Volvo released figures claiming
that greenhouse gas emissions during production of an electric car are
nearly 70% higher than when manufacturing a petrol one. How so? The
problem lies with the lithium-ion batteries fitted currently to nearly
all electric vehicles: they’re absurdly heavy, huge amounts of energy
are required to make them, and they are estimated to last only upwards
of 10 years. It seems a perverse choice of hardware with which to lead
the automobile’s fight against the climate crisis...

If the lithium-ion battery is an imperfect device for electric cars,
concerns have been raised over their use in heavy trucks for long
distance haulage because of the weight; an alternative is to inject
hydrogen into a new kind of piston engine. JCB, the company that makes
yellow diggers, has made huge strides with hydrogen engines and hopes
to put them into production in the next couple of years. If hydrogen
wins the race to power trucks – and as a result every filling station
stocks it – it could be a popular and accessible choice for cars...

Increasingly, I’m feeling that our honeymoon with electric cars is
coming to an end, and that’s no bad thing: we’re realising that a
wider range of options need to be explored if we’re going to properly
address the very serious environmental problems that our use of the
motor car has created"

Productivity growth (workers producing more with less) does not
guarantee income growth. See [the case of US](https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/112/313/564/334/769/633/original/ebbf8c2067795d43.png).
Factory installs better machines, workers produce more with it, but
will they have barganing power to increase their wages because of
those machines? No. To the contrary during globalisation, in the
absence of unionization, they could lose barganing power.

Yep, `bop`, `domcred` are statistically significant, so are the

work independently but in correlation with balance of payment.

MIT Technology Review: "Hydrogen trains could revolutionize how
Americans get around.. Like a mirage speeding across the dusty desert
outside Pueblo, Colorado, the first hydrogen-fuel-cell passenger train
in the United States is getting warmed up on its test track. Made by
the Swiss manufacturer Stadler and known as the FLIRT (for “Fast Light
Intercity and Regional Train”), it will soon be shipped to Southern
California, where it is slated to carry riders on San Bernardino
County’s Arrow commuter rail service before the end of the year...

<img width='340' src='https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Great-Hydrogen-Train-Debate.png?fit=1616,908'/> 

So far, hydrogen has been the big technological winner in
California. Over the past year, the California Department of
Transportation, known as Caltrans, has ordered 10 hydrogen FLIRT
trains at a cost of $207 million. After the Arrow service, the next
rail line to receive hydrogen trains is scheduled to be the Valley
Rail service in the Central Valley. That line will connect Sacramento
to California High-Speed Rail, the under-construction system that will
eventually link Los Angeles and San Francisco. In its analysis of
different zero-­emissions rail technologies, Caltrans found that
hydrogen trains, powered by onboard fuel cells that convert hydrogen
into electricity, had better range and shorter refueling times than
battery-electric trains"

The X-Men, "a dated metaphor for racism in the '60s" is becoming part
of MCU.. That is grand. They can beat that dead horse too now, bring
back that Red Skull guy (with a red cap this time), and have him fight
X-Men, while watching in our minds we can always create parallels
between that and different varities of Woke and its phobes, root for
the X-Men, fear government, cherish "freedom".

Disney will serve a MAGA Hulk basically (who in human form will also
be president), and I am guessing he will be fighting "diversity"?
Because, well, along with abortion, gender issues, there are no other
important issues in the country, like millions without health
insurance, poverty, shit jobs and concentration of wealth. No. We will
have a MAGA Hulk fighting non-MAGA heroes (and wink wink fighting the
government at the same time, remember that when they want to tax our
ass). Bidness interests gaslight. Look, squirrel!

The New Arab: "Munther Isaac [interviewed by Tucker Carlson..]  is a
Lutheran pastor in Bethlehem, slammed right-wing Evangelical
Christians in the US who have supported Israeli actions in Gaza and
the occupied West Bank which bring huge harm to the Palestinian
Christian community.

He noted how despite the strongly held views by the religious right on
the subject 'their knowledge on the situation here seems to be very
very shallow'..

Isaac further described how Israel's military occupation was causing
many Palestinian Christians to flee the occupied territories and its
assault on Gaza is endangering the Christian community in the enclave"

UnHerd: "The capitalists are circling over Ukraine.. Western
multinationals had long had their eyes on Ukraine’s vast agricultural
wealth, but a 2001 moratorium on the sale of land to foreigners had
always represented an obstacle to unrestrained privatisation. As
post-Maidan governments turned again to the IMF for financing, aid was
conditioned on a series of land reforms that would finally allow
foreign corporations to acquire vast tracts of the country’s
farmland. In the 2015 TV series, Servant of the People — which starred
Zelenskyy as the fictional president, Goloborodko — the conditions
required by the IMF for a new loan are rejected and the Western
delegation is expelled. But in reality, things went rather
differently. In 2020, Zelenskyy gave in to the IMF’s demands and
finally repealed the moratorium"

Wiki: "The 2003 ricin letters were two ricin-laden letters found on
two occasions between October and November 2003... The letters were
sent by an individual who referred to themselves as 'Fallen
Angel'. The sender, who claimed to own a trucking company, expressed
anger over changes in federal trucking regulations... [which] took
effect which directly affected the over-the-road trucking industry in
the United States. The rules.. aimed at reducing fatigue related
accidents and fatalities. Called the most far-reaching rule changes in
65 years, the regulations reduced daily allowed driving time from 11
hours to 10"

Andersen: "Rupert Murdoch had started buying U.S. newspapers and
magazines in the 1970s, including the New York Post, which he turned
overnight.. to right-wing. Jack Kemp said in 1981 that 'Rupert Murdoch
used the editorial page, the front page and every other page
necessary' in the Post 'to elect Ronald Reagan President.'  In 1985
Murdoch moved into television, spending the equivalent of $5 billion
to buy TV stations in seven of the ten biggest cities. Reagan helped:
he fast-tracked Murdoch for U.S. citizenship so that his company could
get around the federal law forbidding foreigners from owning stations,
then waived the federal rule forbidding anyone from owning a TV
station and a newspaper in the same city, as Murdoch suddenly did in
New York and Boston"

Zucman: "As Roosevelt’s [1942] message to Congress expresses clearly,
the quasi-confiscatory top marginal income tax rates championed by the
United States were designed to reduce inequality, not to collect
revenue. Why would anyone try to earn more than a million dollars if
all of that extra income went to the IRS? No employment contract with
a salary above a million would ever be signed. Nobody would amass
enough wealth to receive more than a million in annual capital
income. The rich would stop saving after they reached that point. They
most likely would give their assets to heirs or charities once they
surpassed the threshold. As such, the goal of Roosevelt’s policy was
obvious: reduce the inequality of pre-tax income. The United States,
for almost half a century, came as close as any democratic country
ever has to imposing a legal maximum income"
