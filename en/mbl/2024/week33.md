Strange.. if US doesn't like you, Daesh (ISIS) doesn't like you
either..

Arab News: "Daesh group claims deadly Kabul bomb blast"

US provokes war within Europe (Ukraine) creating chaos. Trained
jihadis to create chaos in Syria that in turn caused a refugee chaos,
again in Europe.  Unnecessary antagonism creates rift between Russia
and Europe effecting European energy imports. Who is winning from US
being so enmeshed in European affairs? I'll give a hint: not Europe.

---

Those jihadi training camps are US organized, funded. Kosovo is a US
client-state.

European Parliament: "[2016] Information contained in a recent Europol
report and elsewhere points to the existence of terrorist training
camps in the Balkans, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"

31 C is a better number.. I've seen 22 C, it's bad.. 25 C would be
hellish, death by overheating at 31 C, not surprising.

Nature: "The threshold for survival in heat is lower than thought —
researchers are using state-of-the-art climate chambers to explore
when blistering conditions threaten life...

[Wet Bulb Temperature] is a measure that scientists use when studying
heat stress because it accounts for the effects of heat and
humidity.. The models churned out a WBT of 35 °C as the limit of human
survival. At that threshold, the body’s core temperature would rise
uncontrollably. But the model treated the human body as an unclothed
object that doesn’t sweat or move, making the result less applicable
to the real world.. [But a] 2021 study.. provided a better estimate: a
WBT survival limit of around 31 °C. They calculated it by tracking the
core body temperature of young, healthy people under different
combinations of temperature and humidity while they were cycling"

GNU/Linux.ch: "The Edenkoben High School (between Mannheim and
Karlsruhe in southwest Germany) has been using Linux for almost 20
years. The classrooms at this school also have smartboards,
blackboards with computers on which you write with a pen, but the
computers do not run Windows like in almost all schools, but rather
Linux, or more precisely Ubuntu in the LTS (Long-Term Support)
version.

According to deputy headmaster Michael Schacht, the reason is freedom,
but not freedom as in 'free beer', but freedom in the sense that a
school can use digital products as it pleases. You can look 'under the
hood' of the software [bcz it is open source] and adapt it. It was
also Michael Schacht who introduced Linux almost 20 years ago. To this
day, he does everything with free software"

That means Thaksin is back in power... Ever since his ouster he was
looking for a way back in, this is probably it.

F24: "Thailand’s parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the
youngest daughter of former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, as the
country’s new prime minister on Friday, just two days after her
predecessor and ally Srettha Thavisin was dismissed by the country's
Constitutional Court"

Thailand.Tv: "[2024/03] Thailand’s $28BN Canal Across Itself.. Thai
has proposed constructing a 128 kilometer long canal across the Thai
isthmus, bypassing the Malacca strait. The project, which would be 450
meters wide and 25 meters deep, would cost around 28 billion dollars
and take 10 years to construct. It would save 1,200 kilometers in
travel distance, reducing fuel costs and C0₂ emissions. It would also
invigorate Thailand’s economy and allow Chinese vessels to avoid the
US military presence near Singapore"

Convention, trumpeting the former teacher’s record as an example of
practical solutions to a fractured country. Their efforts seek to
rebrand progressive policies as palatable options for families"

Aaron Bastani \#NovaraMedia: "In the last 14 years, you've had the
conservatives. Now look at [the recent UK riots] as a political
grievance, try and put yourselves in the shoes of somebody who's on
the center right, the conservatives have tried to win votes by saying
we're going to reduce immigration, they've said that repeatedly for 14
years, and they have lied and lied.. and then you see 1 million net
immigration under Priti Patel's Home Secretary...

I can absolutely promise you.. for people who voted conservative
multiple times, that be happening under Priti Patel there is obviously
going to be a significant political consequence for that..  when you
have net immigration of 700,000 people in one year, and we're building
150,000 new homes, that is an issue, and I think it's really remiss of
the left to say that's not an issue. Now the left can say one answer
one perfectly reasonable answer is to say 'we need to build loads more
homes', I entirely agree with that but are you then saying 'well we
need to build 700,000 new homes for all the people are arriving this
year' when we've got a backlog of but maybe four five six million
homes we need to build already, and I think..  there's almost an
irresponsibility here by the left not to address that question"

foreign policy and national security from the inside. This proved hard
to do under Biden, a Democratic moderate who came to the White House
with a massive stable of longstanding aides — many of whom could trace
their careers back to the Clinton administration"

Which one is more fundamental (even though both my be incomplete) -
QM, or relativity? It's probably the former, not the latter. It is
highly likely GR formula can be derived by other means.

---

There are some fine researchers working on the modern aether theory,
trying to scale Casimir effect to cosmological. Ulf Leonhardt is
active here, he wrote *Forces of the Quantum Vacuum* as an
introduction to this relatively new field.. If their approach works
gravity will be reformulated using QFT. They have some mad algebra to
go along utilizing renormalization, working with infinities, w/
interesting math-fu around the usage of time. Highly recommended, if
not for the theory, for the underlying technique. Their research ties
to Lifshitz, partly to Fatio / Le Sage.

So here is some hope... it's not all about the same stale,
overly-dreamy but dumb batch of jokers (is there time! why only one
universe when you can have so many!). These guys have been toiling
away in obscurity, working towards something. Maybe they will deliver
the slam dunk the field badly needs.

---

Roger Penrose: "Physicists tend not to be over-worried by detailed
matters of mathematical and ontological inconsistency if the theory,
when applied with appropriate judgement and careful calculation,
continues to provide answers that are in excellent agreement with the
results of observation – often with extraordinary precision – through
delicate and precise experiment. The situation with string theory is
completely different from this. Here there appear to be no results
whatever that provide it with experimental support"

I have raised far more money from VCs than most founders ever get to,

take VC money. It’s often not a fit for innovation, for caring for

market are largely irresponsible or destructive. VC should be a tiny
fraction of how businesses start — certainly not the default"

Swift boat type attack on Walz? It's hard. He looks tough, does not
have the "cocktail gentleman" demeanor of Kerry who "looked French

---

Not perfect, sure.. but still a good choice

Responsible Statecraft: "Walz has some foreign policy experience from
his time as a House member. He was first elected to Congress in 2006
running on opposition to the Iraq war, and voted for withdrawal of
U.S. troops in 2007. Breaking with the Obama administration in 2013,
he opposed military action in Syria over the 'red line' episode. In
2017, Walz was an early co-sponsor of one of the first House war
powers resolutions directing the president to remove U.S. forces from
involvement in the Saudi coalition war on Yemen.

On the other hand, Walz initially said he was 'cautiously optimistic'
about the 2011 intervention in Libya in its first weeks, but added
that 'I think our engagement needs to be very narrow, it needs to be
very defined and it needs to have a clear out time.' Walz seems to be
generally skeptical of military intervention, but he has not opposed
intervention in every case"
