CNBC: "U.S. deficit tops $1.8 trillion in 2024 as interest on debt
surpasses trillion-dollar mark"

---

No "the Chinese" do not own all US debt. At its peak they held about
one trillion. Japanese also holds the same amt. That is two trillion
out of the 35 trillion dollars of debt.

---

Not taxing and imagining some "spend until inflation" approach is a
bad idea for various reasons. The main one is deficit spending of any
kind increases government debt, and that debt will be held by the
wealthy increasing inequality. Debt is wealth. If I own your debt, you
owe me money. Where's my f-ing money? Pay up bitch!

If I hold debt I am getting the principal and the interest,
guaranteed. That is a cash stream that I can hold, or sell to someone
else. Especially US government debt which is still quite liquid, I can
sell it anytime, get cold hard cash. 10 mil debt, 10 mil cash. Now I
can buy seven homes (like that UK MP) denying purchase to others,
those others will go down the latter and purchase home at someone
else's reach denying them homes, and way down the line, someone ends
up on the streets. ALL BECAUSE NO ONE TAXED THE UBER RICH.

BTW the interest payments appear on the budget, they *must* be paid
annually, which means sacrifices on other parts of the budget, in this
day and age that means social spending gets cut.

Pikkety: "The tax debates currently underway in France and the
discussions which took place at the 2024 G20 summit demonstrate that
the issue of tax justice and the taxation of billionaires is not about
to disappear from the public debate. There’s a simple reason for this:
the sums amassed by the world’s wealthiest individuals over the last
few decades are quite simply gigantic..

Yet some people continue to reject this debate, and their arguments
need to be carefully examined. The first is that these immense private
fortunes are merely theoretical and don’t really exist. While it’s
true that they often appear as numbers on a screen, just like public
debt or salaries paid into bank accounts, these figures have a very
real impact on people’s lives and influence the power dynamics between
social classes and public authorities. Concretely, how would
billionaires pay this 10% tax on their wealth increase? If they don’t
make enough profit in a year, they’ll have to sell some of their
shares – say 10% of their portfolio. If finding a buyer is
challenging, the government could accept these shares as payment for
taxes...

Prime Minister Michel Barnier [plans a] tax on incomes over
€500,000. However, this tax will bring in €2 billion compared to the
€100 billion that could be raised from a 10% tax on the wealth of
billionaires"

After post 1979 removal of the mil top brass, Iran still managed to
fight a war. At the time however observers were thinking Iran would
not be able to engage in any conflict. In fact it is highly likely
Saddam saw an opportunity, egged on a little by [the
Americans](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Saddam_rumsfeld.jpg),
he attacked Iran to exploit the situation. But Iran not only did
not lose, it bested Saddam esp. near the end of the war.

Fisk, *The Great War for Civilisation*: "The truth was that [Clinton
plan] Oslo—far from holding out the possibility of statehood for the
Palestinians—allowed Israel to renegotiate UN Security Council
Resolution 242. Whereas 242 demanded the withdrawal of Israeli forces
from territory captured during the 1967 war, Oslo permitted the
Israelis to decide from which bits of the remaining 22 per cent of
'Palestine' they would withdraw.  The 'zoning' system represented this
new Israeli reality. The Israelis had the maps—Oslo, incredibly, was
negotiated without proper maps on the Palestinian side — and the
Israelis decided which zones would be 'given' to the Palestinians at
once and which would be haggled over later.

Indeed, a detailed investigation in 2000 of Israeli withdrawals under
the Articles of Agreement would prove that not a single one of these
accords had been honoured by the Israelis since the 1991 Madrid
conference. In the meantime, the number of settlers illegally
living on Palestinian land had risen in the seven years since Oslo
from 80,000 to 150,000—even though the Israelis, as well as the
Palestinians, were forbidden to take 'unilateral steps' under the
terms of the agreement. The Palestinians saw this, not without reason,
as proof of bad faith"

manufactured in the United States of America, the bullet paid for by
my own taxes. Both of us posed no threat. In my case, I was running
away with my back turned. In Ayşenur's case, as per protocol, she had
stationed herself out of harm's way or any heightened risk. For her
awareness, she was shot in the head. Despite my escape, I was shot in
the upper thigh and hospitalised for days. Ayşenur's murder was funded
by the American taxpayer"

UtilityDive: "Unlike fuels in use today, hydrogen produces no carbon
when it’s burned or used as a feedstock and has applications for the
industrial sector including steel, cement and chemicals. The U.S. is
sitting on the potential to produce more.. For those who attended New
York Climate Week and the U.N. General Assembly in September, much of
the 'buzz' was around hydrogen production, whether it be from natural
gas or zero-carbon resources like renewables or nuclear power...

Clean hydrogen production has the potential to scale to about 10
million metric tons annually by 2030 — which is roughly equivalent to
10 million gallons of gasoline and more than a 900% increase from
current levels — to meet domestic demand... In the Middle East, Oman
is planning to build an estimated 620 miles of hydrogen pipelines. In
the European Union, Denmark alone is anticipated to be home to more
than a third of the world’s new hydrogen pipelines between 2022 and
2026"

infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics
they had never before experienced. But their lives have not gotten
appreciably better, and sourness has set in. 'We went to the beach,'
said Maanaan Sabir, 38, owner of the Juice Kitchen, a brightly painted
shop a few blocks down West North Avenue, using a metaphor to describe
the emotion after Mr. Obama’s election. 'And then eight years
happened.'  All four barbers had voted for Mr. Obama. But only two
could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time. And even then, it was a
sort of protest. One wrote in Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic opponent,
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The other wrote in himself"

Chris Hedges: "The main section in the Wye Agreement was not about
withdrawals, but about security. And this was liberally laced with
references to terrorists, terrorist cells and terrorist organizations
involving, of course, only Palestinian violence. There was not a
single reference to killers who had come from the Jewish settler
community... Each new accord with Israel involved a subtle rewriting
of previous agreements. Madrid, with all its safeguards for the
Palestinians, turned into Oslo, no safeguards at all, and a system of
Israeli withdrawal that was so constructed that deadlines no longer
had to be met. This turned into the 1997 Hebron Accord, which allowed
Jewish colonists to stay in the town and made an Israeli withdrawal
contingent upon an end to anti-Israeli violence. In 1998 the Wye
Agreement even dropped the land for peace logo. It was now billed as
the land for security agreement. Peace being at least temporarily
unobtainable.

Peace means respect, mutual trust, cooperation. Security means no
violence, but it also means prison, hatred, and as we already knew,
torture. In return, the Palestinians could have 40% of their territory
under their control, as opposed to 90% they expected under
Oslo.. [Robert Fisk] totally captured this process by which Israel
makes an agreement which was always open ended, always done in stages,
and then rolls it backward, rolls it backward, rolls it backward,
which, of course, we're now witnessing with the areas A, B and C in
the West Bank, which have been violated. I think the
Palestinians.. are allowed to control on their own, about 19% of the
West Bank. But now you have the settlers making incursions into
Ramallah"

it actually doable. Our paper explains why chasing this goal is a
fool’s errand, and a waste of humanity’s resources.’.. ‘There will
never be enough computing power to create AGI using machine learning
that can do the same, because we’d run out of natural resources long

Declassified UK: "Israel’s largest arms firm Elbit Systems is finally
losing money at its drone engine factory near Birmingham,
England. This follows years of campaigning by Palestine Action, a
group I co-founded in 2020. Back then, Elbit’s subsidiary UAV Engines
was making millions of pounds in profit with an £11m turnover.

That was until we showed up. Palestine Action has staged over 20
protests at the firm’s factory in Shenstone, blockading the gates,
occupying the roof and smashing up equipment. We did this because
Elbit makes 85% of Israel’s drone fleet terrorising Gaza, including
the Hermes armed drones from which even British aid workers are not
safe.

And although UAV Engines claim that it produces components solely for
the British army, trade licence data shows it exports drone parts to
Israel. For decades this business, which Elbit turned from a motorbike
manufacturer to an arms firm in the mid-1990s, has been consistently
profitable.

But its latest accounts show the company is now in the red"

Isaacson, *Einstein*: "By now the siren song of a unified theory had
come to mesmerize Einstein... On his steamer ride through Asia, he
polished a new paper and, upon arriving in Egypt in February 1923,
immediately mailed it to Planck in Berlin for publication. His goal,
he declared, was 'to understand the gravitational and electromagnetic
field as one.'  Once again, Einstein’s pronouncements made headlines
around the world.  'Einstein Describes His Newest Theory,' proclaimed
the New York Times.  But this approach led nowhere, just like the
others...

In the world of physics, where quantum mechanics was now accepted,
Einstein and his fitful quest for a unified theory were beginning to
be seen as quaint. But in the popular imagination, he was still a
superstar. The frenzy that surrounded the publication of his January
1929 five-page paper, which was merely the latest in a string of
theoretical stabs that missed the mark, was astonishing. Journalists
from around the world crowded around his apartment building, and
Einstein was barely able to escape them to go into hiding at his
doctor’s villa on the Havel River outside of town. The New York Times
had started the drumbeat weeks earlier with an article headlined
'Einstein on Verge of Great Discovery: Resents Intrusion.'.. 

Even before his little paper was published, he gave an interview about
it to a British newspaper. 'It has been my greatest ambition to
resolve the duality of natural laws into unity,' he said. “The purpose
of my work is to further this simplification, and particularly to
reduce to one formula the explanation of the gravitational and
electromagnetic fields. For this reason I call it a contribution to ‘a
unified field theory’... Now, but only now, we know that the force
that moves electrons in their ellipses about the nuclei of atoms is
the same force that moves our earth in its annual course around the
sun.' Of course, it turned out that he did not know that, nor do we
know that even now.

When [the paper] was released on January 30.. The New York Herald
Tribune decided to print the entire paper verbatim, but it had trouble
figuring out how to cable all the Greek letters and symbols over
telegraph machines.  So it hired some Columbia physics professors to
devise a coding system and then reconstruct the paper in New York,
which they did. The Tribune’ s colorful article about how they
transmitted the paper was a lot more comprehensible to most readers
than Einstein’s paper itself. The New York Times, for its part, raised
the unified theory to a religious level by sending reporters that
Sunday to churches around the city to report on the sermons about
it. 'Einstein Viewed as Near Mystic,' the headline declared...

Theologians and journalists may have been wowed, but physicists were
not. Eddington, usually a fan, expressed doubts. Over the next year,
Einstein kept refining his theory and insisting to friends that the
equations were 'beautiful.'  But he admitted to his dear sister that
his work had elicited 'the lively mistrust and passionate rejection of
my colleagues.'  Among those who were dismayed was Wolfgang
Pauli.

[Later] he turned his attention to yet another revised approach that
would make more headlines but not more headway in solving the great
riddle he had set for himself. 'Einstein Completes Unified Field
Theory,' the New York Times reported on January 23, 1931, with little
intimation that it was neither the first nor would it be the last time
there would be such an announcement. And then again, on October 26 of
that year: 'Einstein Announces a New Field Theory.'.. And so it went,
for another two decades. None of Einstein’s offerings ever resulted in
a successful unified field theory"

---

After he arrived to America they turned him into a celebrity, that
probably did not help his work... He'd made a mistake with GR and that
mistake became entrenched, not reversed, to top it off the next
generation of scientists would try to connect with that broken theory
rather than go back to drawing board and try something else.
Einstein's undeserved celebrity status and US culture's treatment /
expectation of science held back fundamental research for nearly a
century now.

Schahill, *Blackwater*: "[Naomi] Klein, who traveled to Iraq during
Bremer's tenure in the country and has written extensively on.. the
effects of his edict-based governance as such:

>[Bremer] enacted a radical set of laws unprecedented in their
>generosity to multinational corporations. There was Order 37, which
>lowered Iraq's corporate tax rate from roughly 40 percent to a flat 15
>percent. There was Order 39, which allowed foreign companies to own
>100 percent of Iraqi assets outside of the natural-resource

It seems appropriate, then, that Bremer, the senior U.S. official in
Iraq, the public face of the occupation, would not be protected by
U.S. government forces or Iraqi security but rather by a private
mercenary company"
