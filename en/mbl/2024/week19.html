<p>PV Magazine: "The US Department of Energy's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell
Technologies Office (HFTO) has published a detailed strategy and
planning document that will help guide hydrogen innovation and
research in the coming years. It outlines HFTO's mission, goals, and
strategic approach, said the Department of Energy. The document aims
for 'clean' hydrogen production costs of $2/kg by 2026 and 1/kg by
2031, but also electrolyzer system cost of 250 dollars/kW
(low-temperature electrolyzers) and 500 dollars/kW (high-temperature
electrolyzers) by 2026."</p>

<p>Modern cosmologists.. The ineptness of these people truly boggles the
mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Robitaille: "Have Astronomers Assigned a Signal Produced by the Oceans
to the Cosmos?.. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson detected a strong
microwave signal surrounding the Earth. They ascribed a temperature of
3.5 K to the source, and the cosmology community immediately
attributed the signal to the primordial explosion. According to
astrophysicists, Penzias and Wilson had discovered a remnant of the
Big Bang and the central pillar of modern cosmology. Yet, Kirchhoff’s
Law of Thermal emission states that, in order to ascribe a temperature
from a blackbody spectrum, the source must be in thermal equilibrium
within an opaque enclosure. This was clearly not the case for the Big
Bang....</p>
<p>[We argue] that the monopole of the background arises from the
hydrogen bond in water on Earth. Images of nuclear explosions [can] be
viewed in order to help establish that the surface of the oceans, when
undergoing shock compression, manifest the hexagonal planar structure
associated with graphite and soot, some of the best blackbodies
known. Water has the ability to both absorb and emit microwaves and it
is likely that the surface of water maintains hexagonal planar
structure with ability to emit in the microwave. Penzias and Wilson
should have detected a signal from the Earth itself, but they did
not. This is because they erroneously participated in assigning the
monopole of the microwave background to the universe"</p>
<hr />
<p>How could this "afterglow of the Big Bang" be aligned with our puny
little solar system? The answer: CMB originates from our solar system!
It has nothing to do with some dubious theory about the beginning of
the universe.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wiki: "The 'axis of evil' is a name given to the apparent correlation
between the plane of the Solar System and aspects of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). It gives the plane of the Solar System and
hence the location of Earth a greater significance than might be
expected by chance"</p>

<p><em>End Times</em>: "[T]he American ruling class continues to be very
effective at advancing its narrow, short-term, parochial
interests. With every piece of tax legislation, the tax code is
becoming more regressive; today the effective taxes on corporations
and billionaires are at the lowest levels since the 1920s. By
successfully arguing that money is 'free speech', corporations have
largely dismantled constraints on using their wealth to shape American
politics. The federal minimum wage continues to decline in real terms,
despite inflation reaching levels not seen since the 1980s. The
disagreements between the conservatives and the progressives within
the ruling class focus almost entirely on cultural issues. The
economic elites, who dominate the American polity, can tolerate a
great diversity of views on such issues, as long as the consensus on
promoting their collective economic interests (keeping their taxes and
worker wages low) is strong"</p>

<p>Weinersmith, <em>A City on Mars</em>: "[T]he Martian surface is
poisonous. Perchlorates, a class of chemicals found in trace levels on
Earth, make up 0.5 to 1.0 percent of Martian surface
soil.. perchlorates are a pretty nasty chemical. At high doses, they
cause thyroid problems by competing with the iodine ions your body
needs to produce certain hormones. This is probably not good,
especially for developing fetuses and children.. When people talk
about space, they are often weirdly generous to conditions they would
never accept on Earth. Imagine you’re planning to have kids and are
looking to buy a homestead. How do you feel about a real estate agent
saying, 'It’s a great location, but I should mention the surface
contains high levels of chemicals that are dangerous for children. And
those chemicals can get taken up by edible plants, so if I were you
I’d convert those perchlorates to oxygen before you put in the veggie
patch'..</p>
<p>Martian dust is also more active than moondust. In 1971, as the first
Mars orbiter, Mariner 9, approached its target planet, something
happened ​that surprised the scientists. The red surface of Mars seemed
to resolve itself into featureless smoothness—apparently a flat disk
where a sphere was supposed to be. It turned out the entire planet,
except for bits at the poles and the tall volcanic peaks, was
enveloped in a single massive dust storm. Impressively, from the
perspective of human discomfort, these dust storms occur even though
the atmosphere is quite thin—just about 1 percent of Earth pressure,
almost entirely made of carbon dioxide. The net result here is that if
you step outside, you still die about as quickly as you would on the
Moon, but also from time to time the sky is blotted out by killer
toxic dirt"</p>

residence they went so far as to target Rabin's wife Leia, taunting
her with shouts like 'you will be strung up like Mussolini'.. The
protests were so extreme the other leaders within Netanyahu's Likud
