App Developer: "A couple of months ago, Google changed its API policy
and revoked [our Android app] iA Writer’s access to Google Drive on
Android. By freezing up Android’s main storage option, our app was
frozen in carbonite... we [already] had to rewrite privacy statements,
update documents, and pass a series of security checks, all while
facing a barrage of new, ever-shifting requirements... [Google kept
altering the deal]... In order to get our users full access to their
Google Drive on their devices, we now needed to pass a yearly CASA
(Cloud Application Security Assessment) audit. This requires hiring a
third-party vendor like KPMG.

An indie company handing over a month’s worth of revenue to a 'Big
Four' firm like KPMG for a pretty much meaningless scan. And, of
course, this would be a recurring annual expense. More cash for
Google’s partners, while small developers like us foot the bill.. [It
soon] became clear this wasn’t just our battle—developers everywhere
were facing similar bureaucratic entanglements, all designed to
benefit Google’s partners while squeezing the life out of smaller
companies"

Know-how creates growth, not enterpreneurship. If there is know-how
you can build a business around that. It's easy at that point. A
monkey could do it.

Yunus is the microcredit guy, has all the right globalist connections,
and is a "Nobel laureate". Giving micro loans to house wifes to fix
their broken tea pots does not induce betterment on a large
scale. What does in the modern world is government help.

Firstpost: "[O]usted [Bangladesh] prime minister Sheikh Hasina
launched another blistering attack on the the interim leader Muhammad
Yunus.. Hasina said, 'This undemocratic group led by the fascist Yunus
has no responsibility towards the people. They are obstructing all
public welfare-oriented work by seizing power.'.. Hasina said: 'About
50 million people in Bangladesh were under the social security
system. They were given various allowances. It has been alleged that
most of the allowances have been stopped. The family cards of 4.3
million families under the TCB have been cancelled'"

New Atlas: "New retrofit lets micro-turbines burn both hydrogen and
natural gas.. As a way to keep small natural gas power plants
operating in anticipation of a hydrogen economy, the Deutsche Zentrum
für Luft und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center, or DLR) and Power
Service Consulting (PSC) have tested a way for micro-turbines to burn
hydrogen, gas, or both"

Everybody knows Ubisoft's NFT games and NFT initiative crashed and
burned and they had to stop talking about AI, but one other thing I'm
noticing is every game with generative AI elements is absolutely
slated by consumers.. on the Catly trailer from The Game Awards across
different channels.

It's exciting to see a new generation just outright reject this
stuff..

I still think the most incredible moment of the Ubisoft NFT saga was
when they rolled out the exec in charge of it to the media and he
basically said that their customers are dumb dumbs who don't
understand it. And then the whole thing trundled off a cliff as nobody
wanted it.

You can see similar vibes emerging from big tech companies too with
AI, e.g. Microsoft had people vibing on 'our customers are luddites
and morons' with Recall at first.

If you want a similar one, go read the comments on Recall and Copilot+
PC videos on YouTube. It's eye watering. You can see the future.

Apparently nobody at Microsoft is willing to tell Microsoft's CEO that
people don't actually want the product - so the customers will"

Newswit: "[MAN hTGX] was recently crowned winner of the Truck
Innovation Award 2025. The direct-injection engine with 6 cylinders
has 16.8 L displacement and produces 383 kW power output. It will be
equipped with the hydrogen power cell unit of the Stuttgart-based
automotive supplier, consisting of piston, piston rings, piston pin
and cylinder liner. Further components from MAHLE will also be used in
the valve train. MAN plans to build around 200 units of its truck,
classified as a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV)... The use of hydrogen in
the combustion engine is an important lever for decarbonization"

---

Gasworld: "CryoVac, based near Oslo, has received an Approval in
Principle (AiP) from the classification society DNV for its vacuum
insulation technology. The system addresses some of the biggest
challenges of storing and transporting liquid hydrogen...

CryoVac's solution uses a new type of vacuum insulation panel, called
CryoPan, to create an efficient, lightweight system. The design
incorporates hexagonal panels welded into continuous surfaces,
offering strong insulation and reducing the evaporation of hydrogen,
known as boil-off"

"Iran lost massive influence after Assad". They actually had too much
influence, now it is back to normal levels. Usually Constantinople and
the Levant (East Medi) are linked not the Levant and waaay the f--k
over there in the east, Persia. Iran still has massive influence in
its orbit. After Saddam they have more power in Iraq. That's plenty of
gain for a state, and historically justified.

Russia today is a market economy, some of their intellectual go
overboard in their defense of the market economy but the excess can
partly be explained via the zeal of a new convert. Russians had little
of the market during modern times, now communism is gone and they have
a new toy, some obsessed over it. This is just offsetting a previous
absence IMO... Even in gov, when the *siloviki* took control via Putin it
was notable they chose someone (obviously) with a security background
but also had an economics degree.

You can use the market approach to the extent it is useful. But no one
should doubt either in Russia, or China they'll knock the living shit
out of you if you are a businessman and yapping away the way many of
those muckers do in America. The Anglo culture is a complete different
realm. They are in big trouble bcz of that culture now, pretty much
screwed in the near term, thanks to that past.

China Daily: As China positions itself as a global leader in the
production and utilization of green hydrogen, industry experts project
a transformative leap in the nation's hydrogen sector, driven by
declining costs, policy support and technological innovation...

Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, will dominate China's
hydrogen supply in the coming decades, accounting for 90 percent by
2060.. of total production, said Liu Shiyu, vice-president of the
China Electric Power Planning and Engineering Institute.

China, already the world's largest producer and consumer of hydrogen,
accounted for over one-third of global output in 2023, with production
reaching 35 million metric tons and expected to nearly triple to 100
million tons by mid-century, said Liu.

There is one crazy mathematical geneology line, it starts with Euler,
the bestest and greatest of all time unquestionably the GOAT, and it
goes,

Leonhard Euler -> Lagrange -> Fourier -> Gustav Dirichlet -> Rudolf Lipschitz ->
Ferdinand Lindemann -> David Hilbert -> Richard Courant

This is the teacher-student chain.. I studied stuff by almost each of
these guys. Legendary.

Hackaday: "It’s one of the great tragedies of our technological
era. Smartphones that feature an incredible amount of computational
power compared to computers the past, are largely locked down by
carriers or manufacturers, dooming them to performing trivial tasks
far below their true capabilities.

But there is hope. In part one of this build, a OnePlus 6T is stripped
of its Android operating system in favor of postmarketOS, a Linux
distribution based on Alpine designed for a number of Android phones
and tablets as well as some Linux-only handhelds. The guide also
demonstrates how to remove the battery and use a modified USB-C cable
to essentially trick the battery management system into powering up
the phone anyway"

Michael Moore: "It’s been three days since Luigi Mangione’s manifesto
was discovered in his backpack explaining why he assassinated the CEO
of United HealthCare. In Mangione’s manifesto, he said that he was not
the 'most qualified person to lay out the full argument' against our
for-profit healthcare industry. Apparently, to Mangione, one of those
qualified people - is me..

[T]he press is calling me to ask, 'Why are people angry, Mike? Do you
condemn murder, Mike?'. Yes, I condemn murder, and that’s why I
condemn America’s broken, vile, rapacious, bloodthirsty, unethical,
immoral health care industry and I condemn every one of the CEOs who
are in charge of it and I condemn every politician who takes their
money and keeps this system going instead of tearing it up, ripping it
apart, and throwing it all away. We need to replace this system with
something sane, something caring and loving — something that keeps
people alive"

Burrough, *The Big Rich*: "Hunt loathed Kennedy, who had vowed to
'review' the depletion allowance"

The richest oilmen of Texas during the 60s were Hugh Roy Cullen, Clint
Murchison, Sid Richardson, H.L. Hunt. They are mentioned in a book
about the era *The Big Rich*. In a very likely alternate JFK killing
scenario, these men were involved in plotting and even paying off an
assasin to remove Kennedy, along with LBJ.

The Rise of Corporate Landlords: Are We Heading Toward a Rent
Monopoly? Corporate landlords [..are] fundamentally changing the
rental experience for tenants. As these companies grow their share of
the market, we’re starting to see the rise of a rent monopoly—and it’s
tenants who are paying the price...

Skyrocketing Rents.. With fewer independent landlords in the market,
competition is shrinking. As corporate landlords dominate more of the
rental sector, they gain the power to set rents at higher prices.
