source code of a recent model, he felt that "intellectual property
rights that companies were applying to software was harming the
society and slowing down innovation". He initiated the GNU project and

license, not the cuck alternatives, and flourished because of it.</p>

<p>Its interesting after the first "revolution" once corporate honchos
took charge, the Gilded Age started shortly after, a time of excess,

<p>Turchin: "The American Republic has gone through two revolutionary
situations, as we’ve seen. The first one, which developed during the
1850s, was resolved by a social revolution, the American Civil War,
which replaced the antebellum ruling elites with the new corporate
ruling class. The second one, which peaked during the 1920s, was
resolved by the adoption of the reforms of the Progressive and New
Deal periods. ​Today, we are in a third revolutionary situation. How
will it be resolved—by a civil war, by reforms, or by some combination
of the two"</p>
<hr />
<p>Turchin: "The president of the US Chamber of Commerce told the Chamber
in 1943, 'Only the willfully blind can fail to see that the old-style
capitalism of a primitive, free-shooting period is gone forever.' To
put this in perspective, today the Chamber of Commerce is one of the
organizations of the economic elite that pushes for the most extreme
forms of neoliberal market ​fundamentalism. In a letter to his brother,
President Dwight Eisenhower wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should any political party attempt to abolish social security,
unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs,
you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There
is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these
things... Their number is negligible and they are stupid</p>

radical, and business leaders abandoned his campaign in favor of

<p>Bano: "Despite a persistent and boisterous chorus of 'supply guys' –
commentators and ostensible affordability campaigners, many of whom
are aligned with the homebuilding industry and are primarily
interested in the deregulation of planning law – the government’s own
analysis has shown that its housebuilding targets would have had a
relatively small effect on housing costs, even if they had been
achieved"</p>
<hr />
<p>Bano, <em>Against Landlords</em>: "Before the 1980s the cost of housing was
much lower than it is today. Landlords could not command the
extravagant rents that we have come to take for granted. Private rents
were capped and regulated by law, and the large-scale provision of
council housing had diverted a very large number of would-be consumers
away from the private rental market altogether. The cost of securing
accommodation was much lower because of those cheaper rents (and, for
homeowners, consequentially lower house prices), and because of a
system that was generally less hospitable to the profiteering
activities of landlords, lenders and speculators.. But in the 1980s
the government deliberately and openly set out to change all
that.. the consequences have been disastrous.. On the other hand,
housing-based wealth is dangerously central to our national
economy. Landlordism alone accounts for twice as many people’s
livelihoods as the coal industry did at its peak, even before taking
into account the millions of owner-occupiers who rely on housing
wealth to sustain their day-to-day spending"</p>

graphene enhanced water-splitting electrocatalysts... The Company
benchmarked the graphene enhanced, low-cost electrocatalysts against
two different commercial catalyst materials, assessing the product’s
stability and mass activity. Results indicated First Graphene’s
catalyst requires less energy to produce hydrogen when compared to a
commercial iridium catalyst in similar conditions"</p>

calling for a constitutional amendment to establish that corporations
aren't people, now has 80 sponsors in the House. Section 2 of the
resolution addresses campaign contributions. Personally, I think it
should be in an additional amendment since there are those who would
support one of these sections but not the other. I believe that an
amendment should be single-subject and not an omnibus"</p>

<p>Angela Nagle: "[2018] The Left Case against Open Borders.. With
obscene images of low-wage migrants being chased down as
criminals.. others drowning in the Mediterranean, and the worrying
growth of anti-immigrant sentiment across the world, it is easy to see
why the Left wants to defend illegal migrants against being targeted
and victimized. And it should. But acting on the correct moral impulse
to defend the human dignity of migrants, the Left has ended up pulling
the front line too far back, effectively defending the exploitative

<p>Turchin: "[Previous Egyptian president] Mubarak gained power in the
usual manner: by first working his way through the military ranks and
then becoming the heir apparent of his predecessor, Anwar
Sadat. However, once in power, he broke the rules of succession by
starting to groom his son, Gamal Mubarak, as successor. Gamal did not
work his way to power through the army ranks; instead, he earned ​an
MBA and became a leader of the new economic elites in Egypt. Had Gamal
succeeded his father as ruler of Egypt, it would have amounted to a
social revolution in which the old military elites were replaced by
the new economic elites. The army officers were clearly not enthused
about losing power. According to Korotayev’s reconstruction of the
intraelite conflicts underlying the revolution (followed by the
counterrevolution), when massive protests erupted in 2011, the army
stood aside and allowed the Mubarak regime to fall"</p>
