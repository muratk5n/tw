# Week 41

You see 2-3% for sample sizes at about 1000.  $SD(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{pq / n}$,
Let's use equal votes $p = q = 0.5$, $n = 1000$, then 95% confidence interval
means $2 \sqrt{(0.5)(0.5)/1000}$,

```python
2*np.sqrt((0.5*0.5)/1000)*100
```

```text
Out[1]: 3.162277660168379
```

That is the typical 2-3%. Multipoll daily sum gives me sample totals
at about 30,000 sometimes.. Imagine that $n$ going way up, decreasing
the interval.

---

Totaling increases sample size which decreases conf interval. Mine are
thousandth of a percent, not at 2% or 3%. 

---

I group polls by day, about two-three polls end each day, when you
sum, the diversity of the sum increases, maybe one poll reached by
telephone better, another via Web, the sum covers more ground.

Transport Topics: "Verne’s Cryo-Compressed Hydrogen Tech Nears Pilot
Phase.. Instead of high-pressure gas or liquefied nitrogen, Verne’s
solution is cold, compressed gas that offers greater density — and a
lower cost of creating that increased density — than is available
through liquefaction.

Verne’s system cools and compresses hydrogen to a 73 g/L internal
density, a 33% improvement over liquid hydrogen and an 87% improvement
over traditional 700-bar compressed gaseous hydrogen, such as that
used in Nikola’s Class 8 Tre FCEV. Verne cools the gas to near minus
200 degrees Celsius and then stores it in a vacuum-sealed vessel"

"AIPAC running the whole show" narrative is useful for the complex,
who hide behind a foreign culprit and continue running the show. That
way, there is less pressure on the complex to change, they can remain
in the shadows and Israeli lobby get all the attention. ISR is
actually fine with that too, they look mean, "scary", they supposedly
have the entire US system hostage, "West Asia fear us". Building on
this same theater, the bought and paid for US political class can
throw up their hands in mock frustration and say "we talk them they
don't listen to us!" when in fact everyone is listening to the same
boss. The boss wins all the time, American people lose whose
resources, moral standing slowly diminishes.

---

The Israel Lobby is not more powerful than the military-industrial
complex. America proper and the rich class it produced was wiping out
entire races, enslaving people, triggering massive industrial wars
abroad before the state of Israel was born. They are not gonna let
bunch of Ziopunk fanatics run circles around them. So Israelis became
pawns, an extension of US corporatocracy. Jews jumped from tragedy
into genociding, once being on the receiving side of it, to one
actively giving it while helping arms manufacturers cash in. SAD.

"Typical Microsoft! Disabling Windows Recall is Breaking File
Explorer... Microsoft.. came up with a creepy move to spy on users

takes snapshots of the screen a user is working on, to then catalog

supposed to be disabled by default, but, it appears, Microsoft has
gone back to enabling it by default. The 24H2 release installs Recall
on all PCs, not just Copilot+ PCs. But, that's not all. Recall also
breaks an important Windows feature if someone tries to remove it"

The EU: "On 30 April 2024, seven European projects were selected for

The selected projects are located in four European countries:

Spain (Hysencia and Catalina);

Portugal (Grey2green II and MP2X);

Finland (eNRG Lahti);

and Norway (Skiga).

The Innovation Fund will support these projects with a fixed premium
payment per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen
produced. This means that no payments will be made before projects
start production. From the time of the grant agreement signature, the
projects have up to five years to start producing renewable hydrogen.

The total amount of support comes to EUR 694,521,237 and will be
disbursed over a timespan of ten years. The individual grants range
from EUR 8 million to EUR 245 million for installations with a
megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 35 to 500 MWe.

Renewable hydrogen produced will serve many sectors, such as maritime,
heavy duty transport, agriculture, or in the production of e-methane
and e-methanol"

Gary Stevenson: "The basic fact is, if you own a ton of British

money comes from Britain. And that would be the same if I was talking
about the US, Australia, Germany, or France. You exist in a country
that has real assets. Those assets are owned by somebody. And whenever
you use those assets, you pay that person and the money comes from
you. This is the big reason why the very richest people in society are
actually the easiest technically to tax. If I'm a teacher or a lawyer
or a doctor, I can go to Dubai, to Singapore, and I can work in those
countries and I generate the money from my work. If I'm rich and I own
your country, whether I leave or not my money still comes from you,
and I'm the least mobile person in the world from a tax perspective"

Col. McGregor: "Our government is currently owned by the Israel Lobby,
they control the Congress, they control the Senate they control the
House, they have a great deal of money behind them. And that money
does not come from overseas, [it] comes from within the United States
from wealthy donors that support Israel.. If you stand up to them they
put all of the money at their disposal to elect your opponent, whoever
that is.. they are very open-minded, they don't care about Democrats
and Republicans, they just want people who are going to do whatever
they say, and that means support whatever Israel and Mr Netanyahu
wants. That's the situation, so we don't really control our government
at this point, and if you look at the most strident advocates for the
destruction of Arab life, Muslim life.. or Iranians or anybody else,
those people are rewarded handsomely with enormous amounts of money
for their reelection campaigns to keep their seats, and ultimately to
benefit in the private sector from enormously lucrative deals that
make them millionaires. It's no secret that most people that come to
the House do not show up as millionaires, but they sure leave that
way"

Another point Joss Whedon figured out, can't do Hulk too angry /

---

I bet they chose Ed Norton as the Hulk in earlier movies bcz he'd
previously played two big roles where his personality changed, as in
bipolar. But in both those cases the change was a surprise. For Hulk
everyone knows Bruce Banner is Hulk. In that case studio should've
picked someone who the audience could *see as Hulk*, even in normal
form. You cant use a tall, lanky actor, have to choose somewhat husky,
heavier built person. That's why Ferigno and Ruffolo worked out,
Norton didn't. The stories weren't great either in case of fails.

Platonic ideal of the bullshitter, as philosopher Harry Frankfurt,

Advanced Science News: "The dramatic story behind general relativity’s
Nobel Prize snub.. [Commitee member] Gullstrand aimed at defusing
those aspects of Einstein’s theory that called for 'an overhaul of the
commonsense foundations of mechanics.'..  According to Gullstrand that
which remained once Einstein’s errors and unproven assertions were
eliminated could best be treated successfully by classical
mechanics. He refers to literature written by Einstein’s supporters as
being subjective, delivering unsound and insufficiently proven claims
from a 'cult of believers.' 'Belief' rather than evidence-based
scientific reasoning recurs several times in Gullstrand’s discussions
of those who accept Einstein’s theories.

The British eclipse data, according to Gullstrand, are useless. Even
if the minute bending of starlight actually received confirmation,
that would not constitute proof of Einstein’s 4D space-time...
Gullstrand refers extensively to [aether-physicist] Bjerknes’ effort
to account for the deflection using classical physics. In the end,
Gullstrand asserts that Einstein’s theories are devoid of any real
content and have no relationship with physical reality; they lacked
'the significance for physics for which an awarding with a Nobel Prize
can come into question'

The committee accepted Gullstrand’s evaluation"

Asia Minor ("Turkey") has an indigenous fighter plane? How does it
compare to others.. It uses F110 GE Turbofan engine.. same engine of

optimized for stealth, no thrust vectoring. Absence of thrust
vectoring alone disqualifies it for 5th gen of course. Another
downside, too expensive, 100 mil dollars a pop. Tigga basically built
a more costly F-16. If it goes against any other 5th gen I suspect
Kaan would get its ass handed to it. But the design / manufacturing of
the prototype must have been good experience, surely the plane will
improve in the future. Building more stuff locally is a good thing.

ditching nearly all of the recent theories, ignore GR, Copenhagen

for a grand project of "unification" because said approach already
unifies everything. Key people to follow are Sakharov, Dicke,
