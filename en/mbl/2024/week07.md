The Register: "Microsoft's water consumption surged 34 percent to 6.4
million cubic meters in 2022 and a generative AI guzzle may be to
blame"

Dgtl Infra: "Data centers primarily get their water from municipal or
regional water utility companies. This water is essential for the data

There is no challenge.. you simply do not switch to inferior
technology - battery-electric tech.

Nebraska Today: "Designed as an inexpensive, high-performing barrier,
the.. MGS, was developed.. in response to barrier ruptures and
rollovers with older systems. The MGS has been tested with small cars
that weigh up to 2,400 pounds and pickups that weigh 5,000
pounds... EVs..  typically weigh 20% to 50% more than gas-powered
vehicles, with lower centers of gravity.. Today’s challenge is to
again adapt roadside barriers to match the mix of heavier electric
vehicle"

---

That makes sense.. The same software looked at the situation concluded
the same thing. This could be a problem in the future if self-driving
car deployment increases. 

"Waymo.. issued a recall for its own self-driving car software after
two of its vehicles hit the same truck minutes apart"

---

Blood in the Machine: "We don’t yet know exactly why a group of people
very publicly graffitied, smashed, and torched a Waymo car in San
Francisco. But we know enough to understand that this is an explosive
milestone in the growing, if scattershot, revolt against big tech.. We
know that self-driving cars are wildly divisive, especially in cities
where they’ve begun to share the streets with emergency responders,
pedestrians and cyclists. Public confidence in the technology has
actually been declining as they’ve rolled out, owing as much to
general anxiety over driverless cars as to high-profile incidents like
a GM Cruise robotaxi trapping, dragging, and critically injuring a
pedestrian last fall. Just over a third of Americans say they’d ride
in one"

After the Berlin Wall collapse why was Russia demonized not China?
The potential customers due to a demonized Russia are far richer than
ones with a demonized China, it was more profitable to do so for "the
complex".. For China's case who are the would-be customers?
Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia..? AU has some money to
spare, Japan can buy some stuff too but can also build its
own. Compare that with DA GULF countries, and the whole of Europe, all
in the areas near Russia... Now we hear the sound of ka-ching. Look
how the muckers roped in Sweden, Finland. They are screwed IMHO.

An Ethiopian Jew coasts through the internal Rep primary, and had a
shot of becoming an House member. Were she elected imagine one day
there is legislation on Israel / Palestine, providing arms for the
former and this person will surely vote yes, BOMB THE PHUCKERS. An

yes on dropping a bomb on your ass.

David Deutsch: "AGI cannot possibly be defined purely
behaviourally.. the relevant attributes of an AGI program do not
consist only of the relationship between its inputs and
outputs.. unlike any functionality that has ever been programmed to
date this one can be achieved neither by a specification nor a test of
the outputs. What is needed is nothing less than a breakthrough in
philosophy, a new epistemological theory that explains how brains
create explanatory knowledge, and hence defines in principle without
ever running them as programs which algorithms possess that
functionality and which do not.  Such a theory is beyond present day
knowledge. What we do know about epistemology implies that any
approach not directed towards that philosophical breakthrough must be
futile"

Alfred Jazeera also has an irrational dislike for Assad, again Qatar
funded the civil war against him and had their ass handed to them,
along with their good friend "Turkey".

In general AJ has good coverage of Palestine.. I really don't care who
in charge there as long as it can lead to a sustainable peace.  PA is
fine bcz 1) Netan doesn't want it 2) Hamas did create certain amount
of chaos in area, a change could benefit the overall picture.

AJ is funded by Qatar who had direct relationship with Hamas (so did
Israel BTW). The channel might be covering for their paymaster so they
don't lose their influence in Gaza.

Alfred Jazeera.. did that mfka just bash the PA for no good reason
(see the rest of the article)?  Talking about 'crisis of legitimacy'..

Jezebel: "A good meme is like lightning in the bottle—timing and
context (or, sometimes, lack of context) are everything, and the wrong
person joining in on the fun can ruin it all. Case in point: Joe
Biden’s official Twitter account posting the Dark Brandon meme..  the
post came at precisely the same time that Israeli forces attacked the
Rafah evacuation zone in Gaza (after Palestinians were told Rafaf
would be a safe zone), massacring dozens of civilians in a single
day. Meanwhile, that same night, the U.S. Senate voted to send
billions more in military aid to Israel, all as the Biden
administration continues to stand with Israel despite over 28,000
Palestinians being killed in four months. And, somehow, Biden’s
campaign thought Sunday was the right time for some online humor"

---

Andersen: "As the right marched on victoriously through the end of the
1980s and into the 1990s, even what appeared to be occasional
reversals weren’t really setbacks for the economic right. For
instance, just after rejecting Bork, the same Democratic-majority
Senate promptly and unanimously confirmed Reagan’s choice of Anthony
Kennedy for that Supreme Court seat. Justice Kennedy is known today as
a moderate because of his liberal votes on abortion and gay rights,
but on economic questions—concerning unions, campaign spending,
regulation—he was for thirty years an absolutely reliable hard-line
supporter of big business"

---

They'll decontext the shit out of you..  'Russians are war-like' as if
a typical Russian wakes up everyday and the first thing on their mind
is 'whose ass am I gonna kick today?'. Like it was for Muslims after
9/11, 'they are driven to terrorism', 'they are culturally pathalogical'
blah blah (hint: we need to bomb them, give more money to Lockheed,
Raytheon)

---

Putin went over a lot context in that Tucker interview. The corporate
propaganda against Russia is intense, and a good way to counter US narratives
which likes to [decontextualize](../../2023/11/political-econ-us-mil.html#decontext)
is providing the context.

Stop eating avacado toast if you want your grandkid to own a home on

McManus: "One of the sad truths about American socialist writers
post-1980 is they’ve struggled to reach a wide audience (despite the
fact that there are plenty of societal conditions to be unhappy about,
which could be used to spark a reader’s interest in alternatives to
capitalism). This is in part due to the sheer ideological clout and
vast resources poured into defending neoliberal capitalism at the
climax of the Cold War and after it. This effort was so pervasive that
even many leftists became closet Fukuyamaists, convinced we had
reached 'the end of history.' (As the idea went, after the fall of
Communism, there was simply no better kind of society that could be
envisioned other than Western liberal democracy.)

But.. this failure was also partially a result of the socialist left
retreating into intellectual, artistic, and academic spaces in the
aftermath of failed ’60s radicalism. One consequence of this is that
socialists tended to adopt the tone, style, and expectations aligned
with those communities: writing for a select audience that valued
dense intellectualism, self-conscious novelty, and insular
referentiality over more democratic and popular styles"

"@NoMansSkyWasAlright

I had a similar thought when I was at the Opryland resort for a
conference. Like, you go outside and it's parking lot as far as the
eye can see (that's a bit of an exaggeration. But was able to do my
morning 3 mile runs without ever leaving the parking lot) but the
inside is this super nice, walkable, "outside inside" place. It would
be kind of cool if we could build places like that in the US"

---

"@PulmonaryEmphysema

- They'll also go into a line of hydrogen-powered cement mixers, dump

Even Republicans in US weren't shy of using non-free-market solutions

---

How to kill hyperinflation? For a short-period of time, institute
price controls on the supply-side, wage freezes on the demand side. Do
this for a year, and watch inflation fall like a rock. Inflation has
to do with excessive money circulation among the regular people, money
chasing regular everyday items, a freeze on both supply and demand on
those items will fix the issue.

---

Half-assed intervention, raising wages to match inflation will make
inflation worse

McManus, Current Affairs: "It really is the case that home ownership
is becoming unattainable for everyone without a trust fund, our planet
is facing a serious environmental crisis, and economic elites do in
fact wield tremendously outsized influence relative to ordinary
citizens. Uber-rich bros like real estate CEO and multi-millionaire
Tim Gurner may try to blame this discontent on too much avocado toast
or 'arrogant' workers, but many of us right now have adopted an 'it’s
not me, it’s you' attitude towards what we call neoliberal
capitalism—a state of arrangements in which profit is prioritized
above human needs, personal grit and developing 'a brand called you'
are deemed more important than social welfare policies, and the state
and the private sector work hand in hand to enrich corporations and
billionaires at the expense of the rest of us"
