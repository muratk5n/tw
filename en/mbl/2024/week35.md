Ahmari, *New Statesmen*: "In 2016, Trump’s opposition to neoliberal
globalisation and free trade shocked the centre. Fast-forward eight
years, and his critique of globalisation has attained the status of
conventional wisdom among the establishment.

Team Biden widened Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods and complemented
them with a raft of industrial strategies aimed at ensuring domestic
manufacturing independence, especially in the semiconductor and green
sectors. On antitrust, the Biden administration this summer
successfully concluded a case against Google that was launched under
Trump. Bidenism..represented continuity with Trumpism.

Important differences persist, most notably on immigration. As the
Republican nominee for vice-president, JD Vance [.. said] the Biden
administration refused to see open borders as an element of
neoliberalism that helps firms 'do the same things with cheaper and
cheaper labour'. But even on that issue, Harris is now presenting
herself as a long-time hawk. It’s an implausible claim, but the
rhetorical concession to border discontent is notable all the same"

NYT: "Sahra Wagenknecht, a former Communist, has founded her own party
to respond to German grievances about migrants, crime and the dangers
of the war in Ukraine...

It has taken off like a rocket, running third in three states in
elections starting on Sunday, all in the former East Germany, where
she grew up.

There, her party is polling between 15 percent and 20 percent, well
ahead of any of the three parties in government in Berlin but behind
the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, the front-runner in
Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg. Nationally, her party is polling as
high as 9 percent, forcing her way into the conversation before
federal elections in September 2025"

China staged war games around Taiwan shortly after Lai Ching-te took
office as the new president, Chinese coast guard ships were sent for
the first time on interception and inspection drills off the east
coast.

China's aim with the drills was to practice cutting off communication
with the outside world and blockade Taiwan, and boarding foreign cargo
ships is an option China could take, short of open conflict, the
ministry said"

two years ago, and conservatives consistently charge that its hundreds

scale. The uniformity then guarantees an ever greater scale for the
inevitable conflagration. Monocultures guarantee one big fire instead

Undark: "Kit Carson Electric Cooperative, the utility that serves
Questa, Taos, and other municipalities across three New Mexico
counties and two pueblos, is hoping to build a green hydrogen plant in
Questa to store renewable energy as it works toward completely
eliminating fossil fuels from its energy grid. The utility is already
using 100 percent renewables during the day, but it still relies on
fossil fuels for energy at night..

In 2022, the Department of Energy named Questa one of the pilot
communities for its Communities Local Energy Action Program, which
supports low-income and energy-burdened communities that are shifting
away from a fossil-fuel-based economy. Since then, Kit Carson Electric
has been seeking funding for a green hydrogen project at a
Chevron-owned molybdenum mine that is currently a Superfund site. The
project would bring back a handful of the 300 permanent jobs that were
lost when the mine closed in 2014. Questa’s mayor, John Ortega, thinks
the technology could provide other economic opportunities as well,
attracting eco-minded businesses while making Questa a trailblazer in
green hydrogen and long-duration energy storage"

Kuznick: "On April 2, 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of
war, saying, 'the world must be made safe for democracy.'... Hundreds
of people were jailed for criticizing the war, including IWW leader
'Big Bill' Haywood and Socialist Eugene Debs. Debs spoke out
repeatedly against the war and was finally arrested in June 1918 after
addressing a large crowd outside the prison in Canton, Ohio, where
three Socialists were being held for opposing the draft. Debs
ridiculed the idea that the United States was a democracy when it
jailed people for expressing their views..

All things German were vilified in a wave of intolerance masquerading
as patriotism. Schools, many of which now demanded loyalty oaths from
teachers, banned the German language from their curricula. Iowa, not
taking any chances, went further and, under the 1918 'Babel
Proclamation,' banned the speaking of all foreign languages in public
and over the telephone. Nebraska followed suit. Libraries across the
country discarded German books, and orchestras dropped German
composers from their repertoires. Just as French fries would later be
renamed 'freedom fries' by a know-nothing Congress furious at French
opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, their World War I
counterparts renamed hamburgers 'liberty sandwiches,' sauerkraut
'liberty cabbage,' German measles 'liberty measles,' and German
shepherds 'police dogs.' German Americans faced discrimination in all
aspects of life"

Firstpost: "On July 19, a faulty software update from CrowdStrike
caused the crash of approximately 8.5 million Windows devices, leading
to widespread disruptions, including grounded flights and missed
hospital appointments. The financial toll of this incident is
estimated to be in the billions. This event has drawn sharp criticism
from regulators and business leaders, who are scrutinizing the level
of access that third-party software vendors have to the core, or
kernel, of Windows operating systems.

The kernel is a critical part of an operating system, and any bugs
within it can lead to catastrophic failures, such as the infamous
'blue screens of death' that appeared globally during the CrowdStrike
incident. Critics argue that the failure to address these
vulnerabilities sooner reflects shortcomings in how Windows handles
third-party security software. As a result, Microsoft is now under
pressure to implement changes that would better protect its systems
from similar errors in the future"

Interesting Engineering: "Astron’s hydrogen engine achieves record 60%
efficiency with 0 emissions.. Astron’s H2Starfire achieves these using
two sets of counter-rotating rotors: one aluminum half does the intake
and compression jobs, while the titanium half at the rear handles
expansion and exhaust... The company claims it has achieved another
major milestone by eliminating the need for water cooling. This has
also helped it reduce the complexity of its design and weight, which
gives it an efficiency boost. H2Starfire’s design is quite linear and
avoids the use of apex seals... the engine is frictionless, and its
tolerances are so tight that only timing gears and bearings need
oiling. This has been achieved with a simplistic design of the engine,
which consists of only 82 parts"

with the Roman Curia. In the year 1500, Jakob Fugger loaned
the Vatican the money necessary to build the new St. Peter's Basilica,
the Sistine Chapel, as well as other buildings within the Vatican. To
repay Jakob the massive amount of money owed, Pope Leo X had to
heavily tax the German people as well as sell indulgences, which was
heavily unpopular with a large group of monks, including Martin
Luther. Partly because of the corruption within the church, Martin
Luther was prompted to write his Ninety-five Theses"

Labor was crushed, and voila! Enter the Gilded Age.

Kuznick, *The Untold History of the US*: "The 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s
witnessed some of the bloodiest labor struggles in [US] history. In
1877, striking railroad workers and their myriad supporters from all
parts of the working class paralyzed much of the nation’s rail traffic
as capitalists, haunted by memories of the revolutionary workers who
created the Paris Commune of 1871, conjured up their own nightmare
visions when several cities, including Chicago and St. Louis, were
shut down by general strikes...

The struggles intensified in the 1880s as the Knights of Labor
exploded on the scene, successfully striking Jay Gould’s 15,000-mile
railroad network in 1885. Gould was no ordinary robber baron. Having
once boasted that he could 'hire one half of the working class to kill
the other half,' he was perhaps the most hated man in the nation. And
the Knights, with their appeal to class unity and democratic socialist
philosophy, was no ordinary labor federation. Gould’s capitulation to
the Knights’ demands, in what the business newspaper Bradstreet’s
called a 'complete surrender,' shocked the nation. Knights membership
skyrocketed around the country, jumping from 103,000 on July 1, 1885,
to over 700,000 a year later. The movement was dealt a crushing blow,
however, when authorities nationwide used the death of seven policemen
in Chicago’s Haymarket Square in May 1886 as an excuse to not only
destroy the anarchists, who were involved in the incident, but to go
after the Knights, who forswore violence and were completely
uninvolved in the Haymarket events"

A rule-of-thumb for every budding scientist out there; do not be
discouraged if your new theory does not agree with modern findings,
most if not all of those findings themselves are suspect. You have a
brand spanking new theory about gravity but it does not agree with
"cosmic microwave background"? Before doubting your theory, doubt CMB,
see if CMB was measured correctly and look into the background, work
of the dipshits who thought CMB it was a slam dunk of all slam dunks
in cosmology. Same goes for other so-called findings, the expanding
universe, red shift measurements, "black holes", dark matter, dark
energy.. None of these concepts can be taken at face value.

A mistake such as the one indicated below cannot be a one-step,
"highest layer" error.  Science layers knowledge on top of knowledge,
each new layer assumes to previous ones are fine... The latest
problem, the crisis, cannot just be just the last layer being bad, the
crisis is so horrendously bad, it has to go many layers down.

---

At this point you have to question if the universe is expanding at
all..

Live Science: "James Webb telescope confirms there is something
seriously wrong with our understanding of the universe. Depending on
where we look, the universe is expanding at different rates...  the
problem, known as the Hubble Tension, has the potential to alter or
even upend cosmology altogether. In 2019, measurements by the Hubble
Space Telescope confirmed the puzzle was real; in 2023, even more
precise measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
cemented the discrepancy.

Now, a triple-check by both telescopes working together appears to
have put the possibility of any measurement error to bed for good. The
study, published.. in the *Astrophysical Journal Letters*, suggests that
there may be something seriously wrong with our understanding of the
universe"

IAP: "Any remaining defenders of liberalism must ask themselves not
why the liberal order has failed to put an end to the genocide in
Palestine, but why the liberal order so eagerly supports and sustains
it"

---

Ian Allan Paul: "Liberal Infernos.. The liberal order overseeing and
administering the genocide in Palestine is built upon the marriage of
egalitarian values and exterminating violence, upon the intimate
coupling of supposedly hallowed rights and the hell it unleashes upon
the world. Arms must continue to be delivered, just as their use must
be denounced and condemned. Demonstrations must be celebrated, just as
orders must be given to smother them with tear gas. Everything thus
burns twice, as the fuel of liberal politics and the fuel of liberal
carnage, feeding an inferno whose fires rage ever more
democratically. If there is no need to resolve the formal tension
between its abstract ideals and its violent realities, this is because
liberalism is the indefinite elaboration of this contradiction. For
every sanctified constitution, there is a detention camp that will
never close; for every promised equality, there is an economy imposing
its cruel hierarchies upon every area of life; for each civic norm, a
mob of police marching through the streets drunk on power..

It is a bleak irony that the liberal regimes that defined themselves
through their opposition to the genocides of the 20th century now
resolutely cooperate with one another to facilitate genocide in the
21st. Indeed, any remaining defenders of liberalism must ask
themselves not why the liberal order has failed to put an end to the
genocide in Palestine, but why the liberal order so eagerly supports
and sustains it. Alliances remain firm, logistical supports stay
online, trade routes flow, the international system survives, while an
entire people is buried beneath burning debris"

Observer: "How the U.S. Is Building a Sustainable Hydrogen
Economy.. The U.S. Department of Energy's Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs
Program uses economic clusters to drive innovation, cut costs and
acceleration green hydrogen adoption across the country... The term
'cluster' as an economic construct was explained by Harvard Business
School Professor Michael Porter in 1998 as 'geographic concentrations
of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field.'
The sprawling set of activities around the production of wine in
California is one of many examples Porter advances. The great benefit
of clusters, Porter says, is that they encourage interactions across
cluster members that foster a variety of productivity enhancements...

[Take] ammonia producer Atlas Agro, natural gas utility AltaGas, and
public transit provider Lewis County Transit. The heterogeneous nature
of these parties notwithstanding, it can quickly be seen that each is
a potential consumer of green hydrogen... For Atlas Agro, green
hydrogen is the main feedstock for the production of green
ammonia. For AltaGas, green hydrogen could be blended into its
pipeline natural gas to reduce its carbon footprint. For Lewis County
Transit, green hydrogen will fuel its small but growing fleet of
fuel-cell-powered transit buses. Porter argues that the co-existence
of suppliers and customers in a cluster can create a virtuous cycle in
which heightened awareness of customer needs drives improvement of
product/service bundles"

Amithaba Ghosh: "[1997] The central issue in cosmology is the true
nature of the observed cosmological red shift. Though it is assumed to
be due to an expansion of the universe, till now there is no
conclusive evidence in favour of the dopplerian origin of the
cosmological red shift... A phenomenological model of inertial
induction [Ghosh (1984, 1986a)] has been found to explain the
cosmological red shift without any universal expansion. Besides this
the model also yields exact equivalence of the gravitational and
inertial masses and an exponential attenuation of G eliminating the
gravitational paradox. The important point to be noted is that this
model suggests a number of other observable effects also and such
effects are not only found to be present but also explain a number of
unexplained results. The model does not have any adjustable free
parameter though it yields excellent quantitative results in all these
different problems"
