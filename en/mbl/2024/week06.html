<p>Rickards, Peter Schiff are goldcucks, and constant inflation
scaremongers, esp. Schiff. "Government is printing too much money"
which they assume will cause inflation, debasing the currency - hence
the alarmism and message of buying gold.</p>
<p>While Rickards knows some stuff on taxes (his earlier job) neither he
nor Schiff understand money and economy. Inflation is caused by
excessive money circulating among the general population, not among
the rich.  "Government printing money" can only cause inflation if it
goes to all citizens (as it briefly did after covid, then went away
because all flows end up with the corps). Goverment normally borrows
FED printed money, due to the skewed nature of the economy it ends up
with big corporations and the wealthy, it does <strong>not</strong> circulate. You
are not in competition with the Citibank CEO to buy potatoes bidding
their prices up. He is eating caviar, drinking expensive wine, buying
stocks and homes bidding those prices up, not your potatoes (they also
buy government debt, so they collect interest on it, gov gives them
<em>more</em> money).</p>
<p>Rickards, Schiff are mostly wrong in their analysis, that's probably
why they get more than their fair share of audience.. This message is
useful. It changes the conversation to something else other than the
top 1%, constantly puts the onus on government making them look bad,
and centers around an "investment advice" that ultimately has no use
for the regular people, and harmless for private interests who are
already buying gold (and everything else).</p>

<p>Kurt Andersen: "In 1998 Brooksley Born, the federal official who was
running the agency overseeing financial derivatives, got worried about
the accelerating flurry of trading in new sorts of derivatives, in
particular one called credit default swaps—which the rest of us would
learn about a decade later, during the crash of 2008. But she was only
one member of the official presidential task force that oversees the
financial markets. By law, the other three are the Federal Reserve
chair, a job to which Clinton had just reappointed Alan Greenspan; the
treasury secretary, who was Bob Rubin, previously cochairman of
Goldman Sachs; and the SEC chair, who’d also spent his pregovernment
career working on Wall Street...</p>
<p>Restrain Wall Street? Bah. Regulation? This was the great new age of
deregulation, freer and freer markets, big business and finance
unbound! But Born persisted, publicly announcing an inquiry into
derivatives and their risks—prompting her fellow task force members to
put out a joint statement that they had 'grave concerns' about her
rogue regulatory inquiry. Rubin’s deputy Lawrence Summers, soon to
replace him as secretary of the treasury, warned Congress that by
suggesting official skepticism of this latest financial innovation,
Born had cast 'a shadow of regulatory uncertainty over an otherwise
thriving market.'</p>
<p>She lost and resigned. [Summers, Rubin] won and joined with the
Republicans running Congress to write two big new laws, a kind of
final grand spasm of the deregulation mania that allowed the financial
industry to get even wilder and crazier. The first of those
Modernization Acts eliminated the rule, instituted after the 1929
Crash, that prohibited regular banks from investing citizens’ money in
the riskier ways that Wall Street firms did. For years, the financial
industry had lobbied for that change, and the former Fed chair Paul
Volcker had fought it, but in 1999 only seven of forty-five Democratic
senators and a single Republican voted against it. The other
Modernization Act explicitly outlawed proper regulation of derivatives
such as credit default swaps. The House in 2000 passed that one 377 to
4, and the Senate didn’t even bother to take a roll call vote.</p>
<p>In other words, Clinton’s Wall Street–bred economic brain trust helped
encode into the system the increased recklessness that Wall Street
demanded and that would keep feeding inequality and insecurity and
soon lead to the financial meltdown and Wall Street bailout and Great
Recession. Congratulations, modern bipartisan Democrats!"</p>

<p>Question : Do you know how Norwegians fill out their tax returns?</p>

<p>This is an oversimplification, but years ago Norwegians started to get
pre-filled tax returns in the mail. Later they stopped getting them,
but instead had to do an OK online. Now even that is not needed. No
comment means it is is OK. You can rectify and modify details online,
if needed.</p>
<p>The reality is that the government already had most of the data needed
for most individuals. Your salary is reported by the company you work
for. Your bank details, including anything you have in your accounts,
any loans, stocks, bonds, etc., is reported as well. Your kids are
known as well. There might be details to add, but most is known. Why
waste people´s time filling out details that are already known and
risk people making mistakes?</p>

<p>Techdirt: "'The Messenger' launched to great fanfare... The brainchild

$50 million in backing and a lot of chatter about how it was going to

<p>The news outlet didn’t even last a year...</p>
<p>The Messenger’s coverage generally suffered from what NYU journalism
professor Jay Rosen calls the “view from nowhere,” or a sort of timid,
pseudo-objectivity that fails to prioritize the sole function of
journalism: getting to the actual truth.</p>
<p>Many Messenger reporters who thought they were being hired to do real
reporting had complained for much of the last year about how they were
being forced to suddenly chase ad impressions by crafting low-quality
aggregated engagement bait more akin to infotainment than journalism.</p>
<p>Such journalism is a direct reflection of millionaire or billionaire
media owners who don’t want to offend sources, advertisers, or event
sponsors with bold, truth-telling journalism that has actual teeth. So
what you get instead is a sort of journalism simulacrum that fails to
critique wealth, corruption, or power with any real consistency, since
the wealthy and powerful owners very obviously don’t want that"</p>

<p>I did a rough data analysis a while back, looked at a weighted market
cap of top 20 defense contractors, and saw their cap skyrocketed not
after 9/11 but after Egypt and Syria. If it is true it is bad news for
us, the world, because the bleepers learned a new trick.. There was
always death squads, provocations and the like but the widespread
chaos after Egypt, Syria was something else..  </p>

<p>There is always the next bright shiny object to chase in tech.
Inequality is partly to blame here; too much money sloshing around the
system looking for things to invest in. Even if there was nothing,
some people would create buzz around any bullshit tech to get a piece
of that excess wealth. One day that new buzz is "the blockchain",
sometimes "AI". After that it will be something else. </p>

<p>Andersen: "In the 1988 primary, Jesse Jackson ran as a full-on
leftist, calling for single-payer healthcare, free community college,
a big federal jobs program, and the cancellation of Reagan’s tax cuts
for the rich—and by sweeping the black South and winning everywhere
among voters under thirty, he beat Joe Biden and Gore and came in
second to Dukakis, but…he was never going to be nominated... In 1992,
when Clinton won the nomination, his only serious competitors were two
fellow New Democrats, Brown and Tsongas. Democrats had settled into
their role as America’s economically center-right party. There was no
organized, viable national economic left in the vicinity of power"</p>

<p>Adam F-ing Smith was against excessive profits. Maybe some people
misinterpreted the "free" in the free markets he talked about.</p>
<p>Boucoyannis, LSE Blogs: "[W]hy has inequality been naturalized? This
is where influential master-narratives of the market are so
consequential in shaping public beliefs—from the 1970s anti-tax
narratives that frame government intervention as a violation of free
market principles to the original text that defined market discourse,
the Wealth of Nations itself. Adam Smith is assumed even by his most
progressive interpreters to have accepted inequality as the necessary
trade-off for a more prosperous economy...</p>
<p>But the assumption is wrong. As I show in my article, the building
blocks of Smith’s economic system do not allow the concentration of
wealth—not due to normative constraints, but to how the blocks are set
up in his theory to maximize the 'wealth of nations.' Further, even in
neo-classical economics, in a competitive economy with no entry
barriers, profits should decline over the long term, so profit
concentration is not an equilibrium prediction. Yet high firm profits,
for instance, are treated as a sign of economic success that have to
be sustained over time...</p>
<p>In Smith, profits should be low and labor wages high, legislation in
favor of the worker is 'always just and equitable,' land should be
distributed widely and evenly, inheritance laws should partition
fortunes, taxation can be high if it is equitable, and the science of
the legislator is necessary to thwart rentiers and manipulators...</p>
<p>The key principles of Smith’s system work against the concentration of
wealth—they also speak to the top issues in economic policy today:
profits, taxes, and the minimum wage. First, Smith thought high
profits denoted economic pathology. The rate of profit, he said, was
'always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin.'</p>
