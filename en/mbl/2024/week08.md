Here is how a realistic movie would be like. An AK shoots 600/min, in
120 minutes 72K bullets. So the movie could be about just one guy, he
shoots an AK non-stop, from beginning until the end, constantly
reloading, and by the end of the movie, maybe he'd have taken out
one enemy soldier.

Belfast Telegraph: "[2011] US forces have fired so many bullets in
Iraq and Afghanistan - an estimated 250,000 for every insurgent killed -
that American ammunition-makers cannot keep up with demand"

---

The lone gunman among unarmed civilians, or the stock bullshit
Holywood war movie is based on a myth. The hero sprays bullets around,
shoots 100 and kills 100. Reality is going after people who are just
as intent on killing you, and that is hard. Read: "During World War II
it was estimated that 45,000 rounds of small arms ammunition was fired
to kill one enemy soldier. In Vietnam the American military
establishment consumed an estimated 50,000 rounds of ammunition for
every enemy killed".

---

Personal weapons are the perfect market for arms co. The demand fit
with the politics of the times (anti-government, buy guns to "protect
yourself"), they sold these essentially useless products by the
millions.

---

Arms manufacturers would like personal weapon demand to be at consumer
product level, everyone buying one or two, w/ contracts on
maintanance, some ammo purchases here and there. "Consumers" shoot
their little toy around for a little show, nothing more. When things
get serious arms co could get worried, real war is serious
business. All of a sudden you need ammunition in the millions,
production needs to ramped up for certain things not for
others.. Producing little gadgetry is different from war-time
production, and not necessarily as profitable.

US is not an empire and it does not have a deep state - even the
shadiest shit is known to the decision makers, some of whom are
naturally bought out by moneyed interests. Some geniunely might think
they are involved in deep strategery hence they are favored by the
donors because their stupid moves will still help the complex, whose
only time horizon is the next quarter.

Government is a huge organization, there are all kinds of people in

That is hilarious he uses that word too, according to the book *Evil
Geniuses* the real asshole was his father, John Sununu, described
exactly in those terms. Apparently noone in US politics did more
damage to the climate cause than him. Excerpt below:

>The surname Sununu is familiar today mainly because of a pair of
>recent New Hampshire politicians, a governor and a U.S. senator, but
>the most significant Sununu was their father, John H. Sununu, himself
>a former New Hampshire governor and the first President Bush’s first
>chief of staff. In several important ways, he was another prototypical
>Republican for the new age: an asshole personally, a conservative
>hard-liner, and a critical figure in turning the party toward full-bore
>denial of climate change.

China Hydrogen Bulletin: "China now arguably controls world
electrolyzer manufacturing capacities, especially alkaline
electrolyzers, with over 50 per cent global nominal capacities located
in China by the end of 2023.. China will have over 40GW electrolyzer
production capacity by the end of 2024, which alone far exceeds
foreseeable global demand of around 10GW in 2025. However, latest
developments shows that Chinese electrolyzer producers didn’t halt
their expanding pace-at least five companies have announced
inauguration of new plants or beginning of construction of GW scale
production facilities just within first two months of 2024. Through
these cases, we may realize that even the most aggressive forecasts by
world leading consultancies may underestimate the capacity building of
China’s electrolyzer sector"

"*They Rule* is an interactive visualization of the interlocking
directories of the largest US companies. It shows that 87 of the top
100 US companies in 2021 were connected through shared directors on
their boards... A few companies control much of the economy and
oligopolies exert control in nearly every sector of the economy. The
people who oversee these companies swap on and off the boards from one
company to another, and in and out of government positions. These
people run the most powerful institutions on the planet, and we have
almost no say in who they are"

Kurt Andersen: "In the 1960s and ’70s, Daniel Moynihan had been
pigeonholed as a moderate or a conservative, but as a U.S. senator
during the 1990s, when the rest of his party went Republicanesque on
the political economy, Moynihan was a kind of heroic last left-winger
standing...

At the start of his presidency, Clinton tried to legislate an
expansion of the private U.S. health insurance system to make it cover
more people. 'Mr. Clinton and his allies,' a Times analysis explained
in 1994, 'were trying hard to redefine the Democratic Party away from
traditionally liberal approaches to domestic policy; they were almost
inevitably drawn to the ideas of managed competition.  Though still
largely theoretical, the concept relies on market forces, not
government, to hold down costs and expand access to health insurance.'
That is, Clinton tried and failed to pass a version of Obamacare
sixteen years before Obama succeeded..

[Moynihan said of Clintoncare back then] 'He hated unnecessary
government complexity' and the Clinton plan.. was complex and hard to
explain (as Obamacare would be as well). Also, Moynihan 'could see the
[so-called reform] policies' proposed by Clinton would 'not perform as
promised'"

Digital Cosmonaut: "Superfest – Innovation through necessity.. What
sounds like a German music festival, is actually the name of a genius
east German glass invention, a glass which could last up to 15 times
longer than normal glass. The origins of Superfest.. were
twofold. East Germany was always a frugal country with a mindset of
not wasting the limited resources it had, and it was driven by
technological advances...

[But d]espite their commercial success in East Germany, the production
plant in Schewpnitz was shut down on the 1st of July, 1990. After
German reunification, the plant was sold off and scrapped piece by
piece – as no manufacturer had any interest in the technology, or in a
product which would actually 'slow down' sales"

oligarchs. The state became weak, businessman ran amok and the country
was nearly destroyed, situation was turned around by Putin and his
cohorts. VP can still fire a zinger or two today on profiteering, it
must be due to memories of those times.. like after that Wagner
debacle saying "hopefully they did not steal a lot of money". Or the

Zucman, *The Triumph of Injustice*: "[2019] The only category of
income that does not benefit from any exemption, deduction, reduced
rate, or any other favor is wages. At any income level, wage earners
are thus more heavily taxed than people who derive income from
property. More broadly, people with identical incomes can have wildly
different tax bills depending on the legal (and often arbitrary)
classification of their income. The tax changes of the last twenty
years have done away with a core principle of tax justice: the notion
that people with the same income ought to pay the same amount of
tax. It’s no longer the case.  The explosive cocktail that is
undermining America’s system of taxation is simple: capital income, in
varying degrees, is becoming tax-free. This process is not uniform:
some capital taxes are disappearing faster than others. The profits of
big multinational companies bear less tax than those of domestic
businesses. Dividends bear less tax than interest income. Depending on
the nature of their wealth, rich people thus benefit in varying
degrees. The ultra-wealthy, whose income mostly derives from owning
shares in big companies, have so far been the primary winners"

Mirror: "[2018] Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt saved almost £100,000 in
stamp duty on his purchase of seven flats after exploiting a Tory
loophole.. Stamp duty rules changed in 2016 so anyone buying a second
home or buy-to-let property pays a 3% surcharge... But bulk purchases
of six properties or more are exempt, meaning Mr Hunt will have saved
at least £94,500 by buying the seven homes at once"

Part of anti-goverment feeling (propaganda) in US can be fueled by a
certain Southern seperatism.. Per history we know the South lost the
US Civil War and some people there surely were / are never happy to be
part of the larger Union. Art can be marketed towards that, and
esp. for corporate power, it can be used to further their
anti-government pro-rich agenda..  But the angle can be an explosive
mix - *Firefly* dabbled in it but got canceled after one season. What
was the backstory? The captain had fought in an galactic *civil war*,
his side had *brown* coats (Confederacy, hello?), the opponent was the
*Union* of Allied Planets.. Good show generally, but it would give
some people some crazy ideas.. Big co does not want to rock the boat
that much.. It is their boat after all.

A big reason for the GFC was claimed to be "investments products built
on real-estate made the (wrong) assumption their price would always
rise". But we know due to wealth inequality all asset prices always
rise save a few dips here and there. Why did GFC happen then? Did the
complex want to bog down the incoming administration with crisis
fighting rather than doing anything new? We already know for fact
Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail by TreasSec Paulson (ex-CEO of
Goldman Sachs) to scare the Congress into funding the banks. The
complex demonstrated they can dabble in shady business to get what
they want, I would not put it beside them to engage in shadier
business.

Instead of chewing them out why appoint these Clintonite types in the

Jeffrey Sachs: "Only an exceptional president could resist the endless
war-profiteering of this mammoth war machine; alas, Biden doesn’t even
try... When it comes to foreign policy, the president of the United
States has two essential roles. The first is to rein in the
military-industrial complex, or MIC, which is always pushing for
war. The second is to rein in U.S. allies that expect the U.S. to go
to war on their behalf...

Ukraine is big business for the MIC—tens and potentially hundreds of
billions of dollars of arms contracts, manufacturing facilities across
the U.S,, the opportunity to develop and test new weapons systems—so
Biden keeps the war going despite the destruction of Ukraine on the
battlefield, and the tragic and needless deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Ukrainians. The MIC, and hence Biden, continue to shun
negotiations, even though direct U.S.-Russia negotiations regarding
NATO and other security issues (such as U.S. missile placements in
Eastern Europe) could end the war"

They can build more housing thinking there is a shortage, but new ones
too will get snapped up because housing is an investment
device. Remember the infamous CDOs of 2008 crisis, they were built on
mortgage debt with varying degrees of risk, sliced up to various other
stakeholders. Someone holds that debt, and a big chunk of the
real-estate until it is paid off. This is one of the ways how big
money gets involved in housing. If you are holding a mortgage loan you
own a large chunk of an house.
