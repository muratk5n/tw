<p>H2 View: "Riversimple plans hydrogen-powered supercar aimed to tackle
vehicle weight ‘crisis’.. UK-based Riversimple is developing a
hydrogen-powered supercar that boasts a 400-mile range and weighs only
620kg. The supercar is aimed to 'push the limits of range, efficiency
and lightweighting' in a bid to 'redefine' sportscars for the
21st century.</p>
<p>The average weight of new cars up 25% from what they were just seven
years ago, which Riversimple says has led to numerous negative
consequences. 'Increased resource consumption, embedded carbon in
manufacturing and energy consumption in use, increased injuries from
accidents, air and water quality from type emissions – and battery
electrification has exacerbated the issues,' the company said"</p>

<p>BBC: "Australia is rich in natural resources and has long been the
world’s quarry. It’s an export-driven nation; its coal has helped to
power Japan, while its iron ore has underpinned much of China’s
growth. Many hope that hydrogen could follow.</p>
<p>'The prospects for hydrogen are as a way of exporting energy to
countries that can’t produce enough of their own either as hydrogen in
a liquid form or as ammonia, which I think is the most likely,'

time. In addition, the e-GPUs sometimes have insufficient capacity</p>

<p>This is an independent researcher.. also claims there is aether (which
QFT describes), gravity is not fundamental, is similar to Casimir
effect displaying a force, a by-product of quantum fluctuations (in
aether). There is no need for the "curving of space" to explain
gravity but you can reach the same eqns of GR using his approach.</p>
<p>Fleming: "Empty space, if there were such a thing, would be
dimensionless, as it would have nothing in it to measure
distance. Real space contains vacuum energy, and vacuum fluctuations
have wavelengths and frequencies. It is the wavelengths of the vacuum
fluctuations that give space dimensions. It is the frequencies that
give space its property of time.  Wavelength and frequency are not the
same thing, so physical lengths and time are not the same thing
either. The mainstream model includes a four- dimensional space-time
that combines the three physical dimensions and time by treating them
as four-dimensions, but time is still something distinct from the
three physical dimensions, just as frequency is distinct from
wavelength.  Someone stating that time is a physical dimension is
lying"</p>

<p>Steven Strogatz speaks with David Tong, a theoretical physicist at
the University of Cambridge.. #2022</p>
<p>"Strogatz: You mentioned about the discovery of the Higgs long
predicted something like 50, 60 years ago, but it’s my understanding
that physicists have been — well, what’s the right word? Disappointed,
chagrined, puzzled. That some of the things that they’d hoped to see
in the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider have not
materialized. Supersymmetry, say, being one. Tell us a little about
that story. Where are we hoping to see more from those experiments?
How should we feel about not seeing more?</p>
<p>Tong: So the LHC was built. And it was built with the expectation that
it would discover the Higgs boson, which it did. The Higgs boson was
the last part of the Standard Model. And there were reasons to think
that once we completed the Standard Model, the Higgs boson would also
be the portal that led us to what comes next, the next layer of
reality [it didn't]..</p>
<p>The Higgs boson is the only particle that doesn’t spin. In some sense,
it’s the simplest particle in the Standard Model... But there are
arguments theoretical arguments that say that a particle that doesn’t
spin should have a very heavy mass... [but] it’s got a light mass...</p>
<p>[W]e expected there to be a reason why the Higgs boson had the mass
that it has. And we thought that reason would come with some extra
particles that will sort of appear once the Higgs appeared. And maybe
it was supersymmetry [which was not found]..</p>
<p>[T]here’s just nothing else there at the energy scale that we’re
currently exploring. And that’s a puzzle. It’s a puzzle to me. And
it’s a puzzle to many others. We were clearly wrong; we were clearly
wrong about the expectation that we should discover something new. But
we don’t know why we’re wrong. You know, we don’t know what was wrong
with those arguments"</p>

<p>Gary Stevenson: "There's a kind of a beautiful horror to [Chancellor
of the Exchequer Jane] Reeves reworking Keynes eternally optimistic..</p>
<p>'Anything we can do, we can afford'</p>
<p>into</p>
<p>'We can't do it if we can't afford it'</p>
<p>Both are correct - if the people control their own resources, they can
afford anything they can do. </p>
<p>But if they give all their resources to the rich, then they can only
do what the rich will allow, because otherwise they won't get the
resources.</p>
<p>An equal society can do anything it can afford, AND an unequal society
can do nothing without the permission of the rich...  </p>
<p>This is why taxation is at the centre of the battle (or has to be if
we want anything other than widespread poverty)</p>
<p>Taxation is the only realistic way that the people of an unequal
society can access the resources of that society. Without resources
you can afford nothing... </p>
<p>There is actually something really beautiful and revealing about a new
government coming in after 14 years and effectively declaring their
own complete powerlessness. It's like something from Orwell. </p>
<p>What Reeves is saying is beautiful because its true. We have somehow
talked ourselves into a corner where taxation of the rich is perceived
as impossible, whilst, simultaneously, we are increasingly
transferring all of societies resources to those untaxable people.</p>
<p>So a new government comes in and declares itself, correctly,
completely powerless.</p>
<p>A government of an unequal country, that has no power to tax the rich,
has no power to do anything, because it has no resources. </p>
<p>The whole dance makes wonderful mockery of democracy itself.  You can
have whatever government you want, but you can have no resources.
Your only options are poverty and powerlessness, but you can have it
in a choice of ten colours"</p>
