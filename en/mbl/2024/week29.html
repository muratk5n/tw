<p>US industry needs to be encouraged to move away from MS OS to Linux
based OS as soon as possible. You are better off running LOS while
running existing Windows programs through an emulation layer. If there
are programs that have problems on emulation, MS can be forced to
open-source their code. This migration needs to be actively encouraged
by the government, especially for its own computing needs.</p>
<p>"@mjg59@nondeterministic.computer</p>
<p>'Linux would have prevented this!' literally true because my former
colleague KP Singh wrote a kernel security module that lets EDR
implementations load ebpf into the kernel to monitor and act on
security hooks and Crowdstrike now uses that rather than requiring its
own kernel module that would otherwise absolutely have allowed this to
happen, so everyone please say thank you to him"</p>

<p>"Why Americans Are Nuts About Peanut Butter... First of all, the
United States grows a ton of peanuts. .. Growing peanuts became a big
thing in the early 1900s when the cotton crop was suffering in the
South, and we still grow a lot of peanuts today. Peanut butter’s birth
year explains our obsession even more. In World War I, the Great
Depression, and World War II, America was in search of inexpensive,
filling, and nutritious ways to feed its people. So people turned to
peanut butter, and it stuck. Peanut butter sandwiches were given out
in food lines during the Great Depression and were part of Army
rations in both World Wars"</p>

peanut butter] per person per year... Europeans on average consume

<p>Battles around Bakhmut were an example of AW. The fact that the
frontlines "did not move" for a long time was on purpose, not due to
RU shortcomings. At one point the Wagner chief -while still alive-,
was commenting "well we could dash ahead and take Kramatorsk". But
rushing ahead taking shit is not the point.. Clearly the guy did not
get the memo. RU battle plan was about degrading UA's ability to make
war. Wag chief as a bidnessman was probably looking at the theather
like a market to incrase his share in, "I can open a corner sandwich
shop over there, I can expand..". But the RU top brass had a different
plan. He was asked to execute on a portion of that plan. He failed
(then he was died).</p>

<p>Vershinin: "[2024/03] The Attritional Art of War: If the West is
serious about the possibility of a great power conflict, it needs to
take a hard look at its capacity to wage a protracted war and to
pursue a strategy focused on attrition rather than
manoeuvre. Attritional wars require their own ‘Art of War’ and are
fought with a ‘force-centric’ approach, unlike wars of manoeuvre which
are ‘terrain-focused’. They are rooted in massive industrial capacity
to enable the replacement of losses, geographical depth to absorb a
series of defeats, and technological conditions that prevent rapid
ground movement. In attritional wars, military operations are shaped
by a state’s ability to replace losses and generate new formations,
not tactical and operational manoeuvres. The side that accepts the
attritional nature of war and focuses on destroying enemy forces
rather than gaining terrain is most likely to win...</p>
<p>Only after meeting these criteria should offensive operations
commence. They should be launched across a broad front, seeking to
overwhelm the enemy at multiple points with shallow attacks. The
intent is to remain inside a layered bubble of friendly protective
systems, while stretching depleted enemy reserves until the front
collapses. Only then should the offensive extend towards objectives
deeper in the enemy rear. Concentration of forces on one main effort
should be avoided as this gives an indication of the offensive’s
location and an opportunity for the enemy to concentrate their
reserves against this key point. The Brusilov Offensive of 1916, which
resulted in the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian army, is a good
example of a successful attritional offensive at the tactical and
operational level" via Col. Daniel Davis, Jacques Baud</p>
