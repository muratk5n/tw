There was no strategery? Balance of power, 3D chess moves, freeze this
guy, that country, three moves later take the other country, encircle,
outmanuever, R-O-C, double M-G? P-I-M-P?

Butler, *War Is a Racket*: "Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in
1916 on a platform that he had 'kept us out of war' and on the implied
promise that he would 'keep us out of war.' Yet, five months later he
asked Congress to declare war on Germany.. what caused our government
to change its mind so suddenly?

Money.

An allied commission, it may be recalled, came over shortly before the
war declaration and called on the President. The President summoned a
group of advisers. The head of the commission spoke. Stripped of its
diplomatic language, this is what he told the President and his group:

>'There is no use kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the
>allies is lost. We now owe you (American bankers,
>American munitions makers, American manufacturers,
>American speculators, American exporters) five or six billion
>dollars.
>
>If we lose (and without the help of the United States we must
>lose) we, England, France and Italy, cannot pay back this
>money...and Germany won’t'"

People ask Buffett for advice, he obiously has a slew of techniques
using balance sheet data to calculate comp viability, but for a long

---

The guy "who ran money for a long time" and predicts that a dip in the
stock market will definitely be followed by major rise past the value
of the dip is not displaying any genius. For anyone who started to
work with markets after 80s this is obvious. Inequality, wealth
accumulation at the top made that possible, not your wizbang smarts.

The deal forms part of a £56m fund raising round completed by GeoPura
to support the roll out of hydrogen power units that can replace
emissions-intensive diesel generators. GeoPura is aiming to deploy a
fleet of more than 3,600 hydrogen power units by 2033 from its hubs in
Nottingham, Matlock, Sheffield, and Newcastle. The firm is also hoping
to become a supplier of renewable hydrogen, as part of a joint venture
with JG Pears to undertake green hydrogen production at the site of an
old power station in the East Midlands.

Lundin and Swiss national Alex Schneiter are accused of asking Sudan's

Butler, *War is a Racket*: "[1935, A key] step in this business of
smashing the war racket is to make certain that our military forces
are truly forces for defense only.  At each session of Congress the
question of further naval appropriations comes up. The swivel-chair
admirals of Washington (and there are always a lot of them) are very
adroit lobbyists. And they are smart. They don’t shout that 'We need a
lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation.' Oh,
no. First of all, they let it be known that America is menaced by a
great naval power. Almost any day, these admirals will tell you, the
great fleet of this supposed enemy will strike suddenly and annihilate
our 125,000,000 people. Just like that. Then they begin to cry for a
larger navy.  For what?..

The ships of our navy.. should be specifically limited, by law, to
within 200 miles of our coastline. Had that been the law in 1898 the
Maine would never have gone to Havana Harbor. She never would have
been blown up. There would have been no war with Spain with its
attendant loss of life. Two hundred miles is ample, in the opinion of
experts, for defense purposes. Our nation cannot start an offensive
war if its ships can’t go farther than 200 miles from the coastline.
Planes might be permitted to go as far as 500 miles from the coast for
purposes of reconnaissance. And the army should never leave the
territorial limits of our nation"

The `corr` function returns values between -1 and 1. Negative value
for rates and prices make sense, lower rates do push house prices up.
But excessive wealth concentration has 5 times the effect compared to
any rate changes.

Rate rises did not help lowering house prices. Analysis below shows
the highest correlation is between high wealth and house prices, not
between rates and house prices.

FDR took the biggest step against gold, way before Nixon. Progressive

---

History.com: "On June 5, 1933, the United States went off the gold
standard, a monetary system in which currency is backed by gold, when
Congress enacted a joint resolution nullifying the right of creditors
to demand payment in gold...

On April 5, 1933, Roosevelt ordered all gold coins and gold
certificates in denominations of more than $100 turned in for other
money. It required all persons to deliver all gold coin, gold bullion
and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve by May 1
for the set price of 20.67 dollars per ounce...

In 1934, the government price of gold was increased to $35 per ounce,
effectively increasing the gold on the Federal Reserve’s balance
sheets by 69 percent...

The government held the $35 per ounce price until August 15, 1971,
when President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would no
longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value, thus completely
abandoning the gold standard"

Herman, *Degraded Capability*: "[2000] Nato’s fiftieth birthday
celebration was held in Washington on 23-25 April 1999. The bombing of
Yugoslavia had been going on for a month. The outcome was still
uncertain, but dissension was muted and triumphalism was the
prescribed tone. Thanks to Kosovo, Nato had asserted its new role as a
‘humanitarian’ strike force unlimited by geographical boundaries or
provisions of international law.

No humanitarian mission had been necessary to persuade major US
private corporations to put up the $8 million to pay for the birthday
party, or to incite a dozen chief executive officers of major Pentagon
contractors to pay 250,000 each to serve as official
sponsors. Corporate America was well aware of the importance of Nato
as a source of long-term, guaranteed profits. US Congressmen had been
heavily lobbied by a special ‘US Committee to Expand Nato’, presided
over by Lockheed’s chief executive. No wonder: Nato’s expansion will
require the Central Eastern European countries to strain their budgets
in order to procure US military equipment. Poland, for instance, is
expected to buy 100-150 newfighter planes, which could be either the
Lockheed F-16 (20 million) or the Boeing F-18 (40—60 million dollars
each)"

consumption by 80% compared to conventional hydrogen production

Rescue scenarios, for a person, a small group, is becoming a thing in

bad government about to get you". I for one am tired of that take. I
welcome this change.

The Guardian: ‘Litigation terrorism’: the obscure tool that

Mexico for billions – for trying to protect its own seabed.. What do
you get if you cross the planet’s richest 1%, a global legal system
adapted to their investment whims, and the chance to squeeze billions
from governments? The answer is 'Investor-State Dispute Settlements',
or ISDS, alternatively dubbed 'litigation terrorism' by Joseph
Stiglitz.. ISDS is a corporate tribunal system, where a panel of
unelected lawyers decides whether a company is owed compensation if
the actions of national governments leave its assets 'stranded'.

In hearings, which are often held behind closed doors, ISDS documents,
claims, awards, settlements – even the content of cases – need not be
made public, regardless of any public-interest considerations. Last
week the Guardian revealed how Odyssey Marine Exploration, a US-based
subsea mineral extraction company, was using an ISDS panel to sue
Mexico for $2.36bn (£1.87bn) after the government moved to prevent it
dredging off the Pacific coast"

Butler: "[from a speech before the American Legion which made the

high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the
bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I
helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. I
helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown
Brothers in 1902–1912. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico
safe for American oil interests in 1914. I brought light to the
Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped
make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to
collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central
American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. In China in 1927 I
helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking
back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he
could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on
three continents"
