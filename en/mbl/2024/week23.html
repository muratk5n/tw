speech on Tuesday night that the global economy was facing its biggest
transformation since the Industrial Revolution... 'Australian energy
can power it, Australian resources can build it, Australia’s regions
can drive it, Australian researchers can shape it and Australian
workers can thrive in it,' Chalmers told parliament... This includes
tax incentives for the production of hydrogen and critical minerals
from 2027-28. There will be a further 1.3bn for another round of the
hydrogen headstart program to boost 'early-mover renewable hydrogen

Federal Reserve to provide advice should legislation become necessary
to curb speculation.. During the disenchanted 1930s, a citizenry
digging out from the debris of broken promises and shattered

<p>Energypost.eu: "Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory in 2019
determined that hydrogen production costs account for just 15% of the
final cost 'at the dispenser' for hydrogen used in
transportation.. The remaining – or 'hidden' – 85% of hydrogen costs
often get overlooked.. On a cost per kilogram basis, just 15% of this
cost is due to production (~$2/kg). Roughly 50% of the hydrogen cost
is from the station (equipment like compressors and on-site storage)
and 35% is from distribution. This means a staggering 85% of the final

<p>Politico: "If you really want to understand Trump’s appeal.. you need
to wind back the tape to the 1984 Democratic primary, the
almost-pulled-it-off candidacy of Colorado Senator Gary Hart and the
emerging yuppie demographic that made up his base. They don’t remotely
resemble the working-class base we associate with Trump today. But
together, they helped shift the Democratic Party’s focus away from its
labor coalition and toward the hyper-educated liberal voters it
largely represents today, eventually creating an opening for Trump to
cast Democrats as out-of-touch elites and draw the white working class
away from them. In fact, if it weren’t for 1980s yuppies and the way
they shifted America’s political parties, the modern MAGA GOP might
never have arisen in the first place..</p>
<p>[After Reagan, Dems decided to go] harder in the direction that Gary
Hart — and yuppies — had pointed them.. In 1992, that faction of the
party got its wish with the nomination and election of Bill Clinton,
not only a centrist but a Yale- and Oxford-educated baby boomer — the
first yuppie president. In office, Clinton pursued an agenda that
largely put the desires of college-educated professionals above those
of the blue-collar working class. He signed welfare reform and
announced the era of big government was over. He championed NAFTA,
which made it easier to ship manufacturing jobs to Mexico. He
deregulated the financial industry, boosting the power and profits of
Wall Street"</p>

second was from former President Richard Nixon, who gave it with full
knowledge that the book was critical of the Reagan and Bush
administrations for favoring the rich. Nixon’s streetcar-worker father
had left Ohio for California after getting a name as labor agitator,
and he thereafter interrupted his McKinley Republicanism to support
third-party progressives like Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Robert La
Follette in 1924. As president, Nixon himself supported national
health insurance, income maintenance for the poor, and higher taxation
of unearned than earned income. The 1972 Republican platform actually

<p>Israel is needed for the private complex; their very presence is the
instigator of chaos, and chaos = profits. The shit stirred up in Syria
alone (an Israel enemy) was a massive moneymaker for the MIC, and it's
not just about weapons sent to Israel. Israel can sell US military
equipment, with US' knowledge, to countries to which the U.S. is
restricted by law from selling, they act as the middleman. A vast
military deployment is possible / is justified by Israel's presence
and US' "protection" of it. </p>

<p>Just like Israel is not 'the tail wagging the dog' when it comes to US
foreign policy, Russiagate was not completely abt helping Dems save
face for their disastrous 2016 loss either. Russiagate was a suitable
line of attack precisely bcz it forced the Trump admin to be colder
towards Russia. With all the "Putin puppet" talk going on the new
admin had to act hawkish against them, and this was RG's key
feature. As far as the military-industrial-complex, revolving-door
private-owned surface-state is concerned, if Russia cannot be
plundered by American oligarchs, they have to be villified, so NATO is
always front in center in the relation and MIC can sell weapons within
its specs. Russiagate performed this function brilliantly as well as
checking other boxes, blaming a foreign power so econ ineq is not
discussed, attempting to salvage the Clinton legacy (who is the prime
shitlib, econ-right social-left extraordinaire, fake left, poser, and
a dumbass).</p>
