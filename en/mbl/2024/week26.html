contributions to candidates in primary election campaigns this year...</p>
<p>AIPAC also launched a super PAC [UDP]..  which initially did not
include any mention of Israel in its 'About Us' statement. As a super
PAC, UDP can accept unlimited donations, but it must disclose its
donors. It cannot fund candidates directly, but it can spend unlimited
amounts advocating for or against candidates. UDP was the biggest
spending political action committee during the primaries and dispensed
more than $24.2 million in support of its favored candidates. Out of
eight candidates backed by UDP, six won their primaries..</p>
<p>Going back to the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration repeatedly
insisted that the American Zionist Council (AZC) register as 'agents
of a foreign government'..</p>

the Senate begin to investigate whether U.S. aid sent overseas and
other funds were being secretly laundered back into the U.S. to obtain
political influence and additional foreign aid. In 1963, a close
analysis of [AZC official] I. L. Kenen’s financing revealed that this
was indeed happening'..  The Senate hearings documented the fact that
in the early 1960s, Israel funneled $5 million (more than 35 million
in today’s dollars) into U.S. propaganda and lobbying operations"</p>

it a 'landmark study,' one that showed fears of opioid addiction had

<p>On an unusually cloudy July day in London in 1990, the heads of state
and government at the annual NATO summit declared with sunny optimism
that a new era beckoned in central and eastern Europe. The declaration
itself was banal bureaucratese: invitations to initiate diplomatic
contacts, plans to prepare a force structure that would move away from
'forward defense' towards 'flexible response.'.. </p>
<p>Secretary of State James Baker had personally assured Gorbachev in
February that NATO would move 'not one inch' eastward. This pledge was
repeated in some form or other by NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Wörner, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher,
Francois Mitterrand, and President George H. W. Bush. British Prime
Minister John Major, when asked by Soviet Marshal Dmitri Yazov about
East European leaders’ interest in NATO membership, reassured him that
'nothing of the sort will happen.'..</p>
<p>[A] careful study of Russian reactions to various phases of NATO
enlargement gives the impression of a rational power originally
determined to be a friend if not an ally of the West... The surprise
in Moscow was therefore palpable when the NATO enlargement study was
launched in 1995, leading Boris Yeltsin to declare that the Cold War
was slowly being replaced with a 'Cold Peace.' The pro-Western
democrats in Russia naturally felt betrayed, rightly recognizing NATO
expansion as a threat to their domestic influence"</p>

<p>Quora: "[W]hen the [French] PM is from an opposite group (this
situation is called cohabitation) his/her powers become clearer. This
happens when the majority in the national assembly changes during
presidential office, the President has to choose a PM from the new
majority (not legally but strategically, and this has happened 3 times
since the beginning of the 5th Republic in 1958). There the PM has
democratic legitimacy because the change in majority means that the
citizens are unsatisfied with the President's party's policy, so it
becomes politically dangerous for the President to oppose the PM's
actions, especially the choice of the ministers, and refusing to sign
the decrees implementing new laws (it happens though).  As you can
guess cohabitation periods are complicated, with many tensions and
more or less difficulties to govern considering the actors' ability to
find compromises and to cooperate with each other"</p>

<p>ABC News: "Far-right leader Bardella backpedals on taking France out
of NATO strategic military command.. The far-right leader angling to
become France’s prime minister after the country’s upcoming
parliamentary election has backtracked on the party’s previous promise
to pull out of NATO’s strategic military command"</p>

<p>It was a good call, both for him and FR; otherwise prez had to govern
under a suspicion of legitimacy there'd a bizarre lull. By calling for
snap elections u throw down the gauntlet to the electorate, "you
voted for the oppo for EU, do you want them to govern the country as
well?"  Now people will either back centrists out of the usual fear of
far-right, or the opposition gets a mandate and finally have a seat in
governance. Either way the lull is resolved.</p>
<p>F24: "[Macron] stunned the nation by calling the polls for June 30 and
July 7 after the far-right National Rally (RN) trounced his centrist
alliance in EU elections earlier this month... But the president hit
back on Tuesday, saying dissolving the National Assembly was 'the
heaviest, the most serious, but the most responsible solution' after
the EU election debacle"</p>

<p>Biden net approval hovers around -17%, he still has the advantage
taking other parameters into account (incumbency, a non-crashing
economy). But let's not count out Trump. An "Alpha Team" usually does
not run during unfavorable times, for '24-like races it's been beta
types that run, historically, think Hillary '16, or Mitt '12.</p>
