US could be exercising "rule by oligarch" approach everywhere, not
just in Ukraine before the war. It's easy than any other forms of
control, you aim to shift a country's governance always to one based
on oligarchs. Once that is done, you control those oligarchs, because
in a "globalized" system US is the gatekeeper on financial
chokepoints, it is easy to control any country's oligarch, and through
them, you control his country.

Partly a response to McCain saying "Russia is a 'gas station

Afganistan would have been a picture of state health, advance and
development if US were an empire. AFG would get US help to produce
cotton, the interests of US native biz would not have overriden the
interests of other parts of "the empire". Everyone would, after all,
be in the same empire. The Otto treated the Balkans no different than
it treated the Levant. US is different. It is easier to understand
'merica as a conglomeration of trade networks, as a plutocratic mafia
rather than a traditional hegamon, or even a state. US is like a
McDonalds franchise, a gas station, a mall, a parking lot masquerading
as a country.

Papa Cheney is literally the MIC itself. As a former CEO of a military

CH could be an underestimated player in the sanctions game. A lot of

H2 Central: "GreenIron signs major delivery agreement with Norwegian
Hydrogen... GreenIron is about to start operations at its green metals
production plant in Sandviken, Sweden, utilizing its patented
zero-emissions technology"

---

AGBI: "The UAE has completed a pilot programme looking into the use of
green hydrogen to decarbonise the steel industry... Conventional steel
production accounts for around 8 percent of global carbon dioxide
emissions and about 30 percent of emissions from industry...

In the pilot project, green hydrogen electrolysers created using solar
power from the grid were used instead of natural gas to extract iron
from iron ore, a vital step in steel making. The programme is aligned
with both the UAE’s National Hydrogen Strategy 2050 and the Abu Dhabi
Low Carbon Hydrogen Policy.

[T]he production of green hydrogen has started something of an arms
race between the bloc of six GCC countries – the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar.

Saudi Arabia’s $8.4 billion Neom Green Hydrogen plant is set to be the
world’s largest, and is scheduled for full operations by the end of
2026. And earlier this month, the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund
launched the Energy Solutions Company with an estimated 10 billion
investment in green hydrogen"

Gold is not rising because "money is being debased". It is rising
because econ is not working for the majority, goes in a funk... Low
rates forever. That makes assets more attractive, like housing and
gold. Gold is not some magic money-subtitute.  Liberterian libertards
are wrong on this one, just like those MMT types. Money cannot be tied
to a finite resource, and money cannot be printed infinitely bcz
somehow "it's fine until you see inflation".

---

We need to see the big picture however.. Gold is going through the
roof because the market is betting on low growth, low rates, which
will raise the price of assets, ie gold.

---

Use it for trading I don't care

---

The regression below can be predictive, shift gold price back, it
still works.

---

$R^2$ is ridiculously high. Reverse correlation with oil, Euro,
positive correlation w SP 500, silver (makes sense, related
comodities). Oil is an indicator of econ activity, high activity means
high demand for oil, therefore high price. Low activity means low
rates, a boon for gold, since it is considered an asset.

The Decline of Public Property

<img width='340' src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gav_6HCbcAAnvZq?format=jpg&name=small'/>

---

Here's an idea gov provides initial funding to hundreds of non-profits
each year, those orgs can provide employment, and the ones in the red
will go bust anyway, remaining ones can continue providing a public
service in an efficient way. Gov can track the founders for potential
abuse but otherwise just let the existing machinery take care of them.

---

If 'merica cannot get over its distaste for gov, non-profits can
provide another path. The future surely does not lie with exclusively
for-profit co's, that mentality brought you into the mess you find
yourself in today, perhaps non-profits can do something more, represent
larger swaths of econ in monetary terms, albeit with some push by gov.

---

"American commitment to responsible citizenship". There is that
feeling, sure... Tied to a culture code certainly. Is it useful?
Debatable.

Drucker, *Managing the Non-Profit Org*: "[We] know that the
non-profits discharge a much bigger job than taking care of specific
needs. With every second American adult serving as a volunteer in the
non-profit sector and spending at least three hours a week in
non-profit work, the non-profits are America's largest 'employer.' But
they also exemplify and fulfil the fundamental American commitment to
responsible citizenship in the community. The non-profit sector..
represents about [2-3%].. of America's gross national product"

Non-profits are solid orgs.. Management guru Peter Drucker wrote
entire books on them. They are not paid attention to enough, all the
attention is on for-profit entities because they give the bigger
contribution to politicians (they basically own them). Non-profits
need to band together and create their own PAC otherwise for-profit
types will make an hellhole out of your country. Can't let those
fuckers run the roost.

---

O'Nolan previously worked for Wordpress, the famous CMS platform. The
post below is timely bcz Wordpress parent co Automattic CEO Mullenweg
is apparently losing his shit, his for-profit brain is going cuckoo
damaging the WP devs and the brand in the process, so the Ghost
example is a good contrast to all that.

---

John O'Nolan: "Non-profit structures are particularly well suited to
companies that specifically want to serve public community interests,
like schools, hospitals, local news orgs, and — yes — open source
projects... In the US, non-profits are heavily regulated in their
operations, and exempt from income tax...

[Non-profits] don't have owners. And that's what matters. People often
think that 'non-profit' means that the company can't make a profit. It
actually means that the company doesn't have any owners who can
personally take the profits. Any revenue earned can only be
reinvested.

Non-profit structures are particularly well suited to companies that
specifically want to serve public community interests, like schools,
hospitals, local news orgs, and — yes — open source
projects. Non-profit orgs still employ people and pay salaries, and
they're generally audited by the government to ensure they're
operating correctly and within reason.

At [non-profit publishing platform] Ghost..our annual accounts are
subject to a mandatory audit every single year. A shareholder of a
for-profit company may decide to cut costs to the detriment of the
organisation because they're motivated to increase profits and grant
themselves larger dividends at the end of the year.

In a company making cardboard boxes, that's no big deal. Some
short-term money will be made and then the company will probably
fail. The market adapts. In an organisation whose mission is to serve
a community, though, the effects of decisions like this often have
greater consequences.

The primary purpose of the non-profit structure is to protect against
this and ensure that any decisions made benefit the organisation and
its community, not its owners. Ghost has no incentive to slash costs
and drive up profits, because it has no owners. It will always be
independent.

The organisation exists for-purpose, rather than for-profit"

Govs need to invest in social infrastructure, bidness always makes use
of freely available infra e.g. educated populace, bridges, roads,
networks. Someone else needs to do the heavy lifting for them, they
only connect some "stuff on top", and create binness. We need them the
way you need cory catfish in an aquirium, but they do not
fundamentally innovate, they exploit. They are bottom feeders. But the
biz propaganda since the 80s became so extreme, they forgot the true
source of their income. They destroyed social infra and literally
killed the goose that laid golden eggs. They believed their own
bullshit.

---

Eurodollars are dollars deposited in a U.S. bank or foreign bank
outside the US... There is a futures contract on them via CME, "the
interest [on the contract] will be paid by anyone who borrows $1
million for a potential three-month duration at the LIBOR interest
rate. It allows the trader to speculate on a future interest rate of
three months". And, ED market is extremely liquid.

---

Lower rates at any time indicates econ trouble, econ is not heating
up, not growing, hence low rates. Low rates in the future, all the
time, forever means econ in duldrums. Good for asset prices, bad for
people. CB lowering rates more will not help, econ saw some of the
lowest rates post 2008, econ still sucks. Econ is fundamentally
broken. "Biz friendly environment" is no cure. Since 2008 US there's
been no shortage of biz friendly administrations yet the curve
flattened and flattened. People who work on shit jobs will not have
extra cash to spend, whatever they spend will go to the wealthy, or
China anyway. Redistribution is needed, direct aid on the one hand,
highly taxed wealth on the other. Money is zero-sum. Somebody needs to
lose for somebody to gain. Hammer time.

---

Since 2008 crisis the treasury curve has been flattening, save for a
few upticks. Buying ED means betting on rate fall. There is an uptick
now but it will be followed by a fall. Expect to see negative values
by 2026.

```python
df = u.get_fred(2008,['DGS2','DGS10'])
df = df.interpolate()
df['inv'] = df.DGS10 - df.DGS2
df['inv'].plot(grid=True,title='Treasury Curve')
```

Investopedia: "The eurodollar market traces its origins to the Cold
War era of the 1950s when the Soviet Union started to move its
dollar-denominated revenue (derived from selling commodities like
crude oil) out of U.S. banks. This was done to prevent the United
States from being able to freeze its assets. Since then, eurodollars
have become one of the largest short-term money markets in the world
and their interest rates have emerged as a benchmark for corporate
funding"

---

Due to inequality econ fundamentally cannot get better. In financial
market terms that means curve flattening.. Wanna make money on the
country's doom? Can buy a "green" Eurodollar future contract (matures
a few years ahead) and ED price is inverse of interest rate btw, you
buy for the fall. Now I understand why \#Stevenson's writing tone in
his autobio is sometimes so gloomy. He came from poverty, became rich
while betting on a future that would make econ even worse for ppl who
still lived in that poverty. The ED idea is from his book.

You entered that BEV business and you are getting destroyed. The tech

not such a copycat.  Cascading stupidity in action. But you followed it,
now chickens have come home to roost.

Randa Abdel-Fattah: "Palestinians have tried every

just got back from there, and we would had panel discussions, they
tried to shut us down. We protest, 8000 people in the Great March of
Return [in Gaza], protested peacefully, we were shot at with live
ammunition. We go to social media, and advocate there, we get shut
out, silenced on social media. Every single avenue - international law
for instance, US will veto and shut that route down. All these
peaceful avenues are pursued by Palestinians and that is never good
enough. No form of resistance is good enough, it is only acceptable if
you are a dead Palestinian"

Informed Comment: "It took nearly a year for French President Emmanuel
Macron to confront the uncomfortable truth: the path to peace in Gaza
cannot be paved with more weapons to Israel. His recent remarks, sharp
and unapologetic, reflected the urgency of shifting away from military
escalation. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a
political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,'
Macron declared, laying bare his stance. He was unequivocal in his
message, adding, 'If you call for a ceasefire, it’s only consistent
that you do not supply weapons of war.'. Although Macron clarified
that France does not supply Israel with offensive arms, his pointed
comments seemed aimed at the United States, which remains Israel’s
primary arms provider"

"@MikeDunnAuthor@kolektiva.social

Today in Labor History October 24, 1947: Walt Disney testified before
the House Un-American Activities Committee, naming many of his own
employees as communists, including Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman
and William Pomerance, because of their activism as union
organizers. In 1993, the New York Times wrote that Disney had been
passing secrets to the FBI from 1940 until his death in 1966. In
return, J. Edgar Hoover let Disney film in FBI headquarters in
Washington and made Disney a 'full Special Agent in Charge Contact.'

In 1971, Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart published 'How to Read
Donald Duck,' a book-length essay critiquing Disney comics as
capitalist propaganda for U.S. corporate and cultural imperialism. It
became a bestseller throughout Latin America and is still considered a
seminal work in cultural studies. It was first published in
Valparaiso, Chile when Allende was in power. Pinochet banned it and

Vox: "Michael Becker, a professor of international human rights law at

which includes evidence suggesting Israel 'has not meaningfully sought
to comply' with the ICJ’s orders so far"

Vox: "Ernesto Verdeja, a professor of political science and peace
studies at the University of Notre Dame, said it could be 'called a
genocide, even in a narrow legal sense, for several months now' given
the accumulation of Israeli attacks clearly and consistently targeting
the civilian population in Gaza."

Vox: "'Any early hesitation I had about applying the 'genocide' label
to the Israeli attack on Gaza has dissipated over the past year of
human slaughter and the obliteration of homes, infrastructure, and
communities,' said Adam Jones, a professor of political science at the

genocide..  'whatever peace constituency existed in Israel seems to
have vanished, and there is a growing consensus for genocidal war,
