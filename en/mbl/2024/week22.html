<p>Power Mag: "[While using battery-electric vehicles] practical
challenges regarding range, charging duration, and wait times at
rapid-charging stations can significantly affect travel
efficiency. For instance, one of the Academy’s staff members, who has
driven a hydrogen FCEV car for six years, recently purchased a BEV
known for its better-than-average driving range. During a 330-mile
trip in California from Santa Barbara to San Francisco, which
typically takes a little more than 5.5 hours in a gasoline vehicle,
including one refueling stop just outside San Francisco to ensure a
full tank the next morning, the experience differed
markedly. Traveling at 70 miles per hour, which reduces range, the BEV
required three charging stops, including one on the outskirts of San
Francisco to start the next day fully charged. Due to waiting times
for available chargers and the actual recharging process, the journey
consumed more than 8 hours, highlighting the operational delays that
can accompany current BEV technology despite advancements both in
battery capacity and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite their growing popularity, BEVs continue to face other
challenges, especially in their reliance on the electrical grid. In
regions like California and Texas, where the grid often operates near
capacity, adding millions of BEVs will impose significant strains,
necessitating costly upgrades to transmission infrastructure or
systemwide blackouts and charging time restrictions, as have already
been imposed in both states. Additionally, the production of
lithium-ion batteries introduces environmental and ethical concerns,
such as significant disruption from raw material extraction and high
emissions from energy-intensive manufacturing processes. End-of-life
disposal and recycling of batteries present other substantial
challenges, highlighting the need for sustainable lifecycle
management.</p>
<p>Temperature sensitivity is another significant challenge for BEVs,
particularly affecting their range in colder climates. In such
conditions, lithium-ion batteries experience a marked decrease in
efficiency, resulting in much slower recharging time, reduced energy
storage capacity, and diminished vehicle range. This affects BEVs’
practicality for routine use and exacerbates frustration regarding
charging time and range anxiety among consumers"</p>

<p>Philips: "[Studies on inequality] must also pursue troubling and
crippling side effects: high levels of political corruption, the
arrogance of global economic power, the twisting of the U.S. tax code,
and the voter belief in the captivity of government to private
interests... The inroads on American democracy in the 1980s and 1990s
have many philosophical as well as political patrons: think tanks,
university chairs, and publications joined in praise of economic
elites, corporate predators, Darwinian competition, the claims of
political moneygiving to be free speech, uninhibited markets, global
policing on behalf of investment, and 'free' enterprise (however
reliant on friendly government). Allied pundits and promoters, in
turn, have repeatedly undercut popular programs ranging from Social
Security to business regulation. Unelected judges, central bankers,
trade regulators, and global economic organizations have been
encouraged in taking over powers earlier enjoyed by elected national
leaders and legislatures. Critics counter with charges of a growing
'democratic deficit'. These trends are closely related to—indeed, many
of their conservative protagonists are funded by—America’s deepening
wealth and income concentrations"</p>

<p>To judge the effect of an ancient migration, citizen can look in the
mirror. Do you look Asiatic, Eskimo, whatever? If not, the proportion
of newcomers to your region were small, they could not have changed
much culture (the minor changes in genetics is the proof) they did not
have the numbers to achieve it. They were assimilated into the region,
not the other way around.</p>
<p>Newer migrants can ask themselves 'where was I in my preteens?' That's
your culture. No "heritage" can persist past 0th gen. Culture is
received via osmosis, not taught, spreads subconciously. Culture is
not about rites, about mumbling stupid shit, taking an unusual day as
a vacation day. It is in the split decisions you make, it is in the
subconcious belief system that can only be given by the larger society

<p>Ryan, <em>Civilized to Death</em>: "In our world, work is ubiquitous. The
server asks me if I’m still 'working on' my salad. We don’t exercise,
we 'work out.' Learning about ourselves in therapy is referred to as
'doing the work.' 'What are you working on?' has become a way of
asking who you are. Yet few of us are lucky enough to work in ways
that actually align with who we are. We roll in, cup of stimulant in
hand, shuffle papers, try to look busy and stay awake, fight the
hopelessness, then go home and drink too much. Show up, punch in, tune
out. In his semiautobiographical novel, <em>The House of the Dead</em>,
Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote, 'If one wanted to crush and destroy a man
entirely, to mete out to him the most terrible punishment... all one
would have to do would be to make him do work that was completely and
utterly devoid of usefulness and meaning.' But from factory floor to

<p>Paper: "[2011] COBE and WMAP have been hailed by the astrophysical
scientists as great triumphs in science, measuring the temperature of
the Universe, the ~3K Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) remnant of the
Big Bang; a signal first detected by Penzias and Wilson from the
ground, in 1965. Stephen Hawking has dubbed this 'the scientific
discovery of the century, if not of all time'. However, upon closer
examination, the claim does not stand up; in fact... [We claim] CMB is
not cosmic, but a signal produced by the oceans of the Earth:
'Throughout the detection history of the microwave background, it
remained puzzling that the Earth itself never provided interference
with the measurements. Water, after all, acts as a powerful absorber
of microwave radiation. This is well understood, both at sea aboard
submarines, and at home within microwave ovens... if the Earth's
oceans cannot interfere with these measurements, it is precisely
because they are the primary source of the signal'"</p>

doing so, he nearly doubled the maximum field strength in MRI and gave
birth to Ultra High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging
