The New European: "[Tory] dissent has broken out once again,
unsurprisingly with Europe and Brexit as its heart. This time, the
squabble is over suggestions that Sunak has 'offered to sacrifice some
of Britain’s Brexit freedoms in a bid to re-establish devolved
government in Northern Ireland', as the Daily Telegraph reported on
Wednesday. The theory is that by promising no extra trade barriers in
the Irish Sea, the prime minister will be able to persuade the
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to end its two-year boycott of
Stormont, the Northern Irish parliament... Putting up no new trade
barriers would effectively mean Britain tying itself to EU standards
governing products sold in the bloc. This is good news for British
exporters"

They filmed the movie in a single, unbroken shot, hence the
name. There are some theatrical aspects to that but the camera angle
still matters (in theatre you don't control that), it looked like the
production meant to show scenes in a specific way, so it had to hit
those points in a continuous shot, that is tough to prepare for.

argue among themselves how much social services they can cut and
whether they can, pretty-please, maybe give the lower income folk a

Without water you can't build a "vibrant" city, dumbass

The Urbanist: "Now billionaire and former Walmart executive Mark Lore
has dreamt up plans for building another utopian city in the desert,
Telosa..  Some of the greatest expenses in Telosa will be related to
the city’s environmental challenges. Building on cheap land in the
desert comes with disadvantages, most notably lack of water – which
incidentally is already a major challenge for U.S. cities like Los
Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, and Atlanta. Critics have noted that the
climate crisis will only worsen water shortages"

Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell
everyone not to run it themselves. Instead, you are supposed to leave
that to an 'as a service' provider, or perhaps to 'the cloud'...

The assumption is then that 'the cloud' is somehow able to turn
insecure software into a secure service. Yet even the past year, we’ve
learned that Microsoft’s email platform was thoroughly hacked, down to
classified government email (update: it happened again!). There are
also well-founded worries about the security of the Azure
cloud. Meanwhile, industry darling Okta, which provides LOG IN
SOLUTIONS got comprehensively owned. This was their second breach
within a year. Also, there was a suspicious spate of Okta users
getting hacked subsequently"

CH's A2/AD investments, its big navy, big as in numbers not
necessarily deep sea faring capability, makes more sense for a
regional blockade scenario too. In a hot war many actors in the area
can take potshots at them. With a blockade countries must decide
specifically to break blockade and risk escalation.

Jestrab: "Much of the public discussion around a China-Taiwan conflict
centers on an invasion; however, a number of factors make this the
least likely scenario. The primary reason why an invasion scenario is
unlikely is that it runs contrary to the PRC’s strategic objectives
and reasons for seeking unification. An invasion would result in
significant direct physical violence against the people of Taiwan, the
population that the CCP seeks to rule. Additionally, the PRC gives
priority to economic development as a 'central task' of its continued
growth. An invasion would certainly result in harm to the Chinese
economy due to international sanctions and significant destruction to
Taiwan’s infrastructure and economy.

Geographic factors also make an invasion difficult, including the fact
that two-thirds of the country is rugged mountains and 80 percent of
the population lives in urban environments. Achieving success during
an invasion would likely require preemptive attacks on US and allied
forces, and there would be limited de-escalation options if this
occurred. The historical precedent is that the United States is highly
committed to wars it enters after being attacked. Unlike an invasion
scenario, a blockade could be reversable, and the level of force used
could be adjusted...

A blockade is the most likely and dangerous scenario, due to
Taiwan’s reliance on maritime trade to sustain its economic
prosperity. Moreover, a nonkinetic blockade is appealing to the PRC,
as it is the lowest level of coercive action that could remain below
the threshold of open hostilities and still achieve its national
objectives...

A successful blockade disrupting maritime trade would shutter Taiwan’s
economy. Rationing of scarce energy and food reserves, amplified by a
lack of viable resupply plans, would generate fear and uncertainty
among the Taiwanese population — in sustaining their lives, getting
their next meal, and maintaining their personal economic security. The
PRC’s actions would grind day- to-day life on the island to a
halt. Democracy is more sensitive to economic disruptions than other
forms of government, and a successful blockade could result in panic"

Paper by Marek Jestrab claims a blockade of Taiwan is more likely than
an Chinese invasion of Taiwan. That sounds right.

In other words hydrogen allows Moon to become a gateway to other
planets. Without it the whole concept would be impossible. What a
magic element. 

MIT Technology Review: "The moon is a treasure trove of valuable
resources.. there’s one resource in particular that has
excited.. virtually anyone with a vested interest in making
spaceflight to distant worlds more affordable. It’s water... Why? If
you split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and then liquefy those
constituents, you have rocket fuel. If you can stop at the moon’s
orbit or a lunar base to refuel, you no longer need to bring all your
propellant with you as you take off, making your spacecraft
significantly lighter and cheaper to launch. That’s important because
Earth’s atmosphere and gravitational pull necessitate use of tons of
fuel per second when rockets launch. Creating a sustainable source of
fuel in space could reduce the costs and hazards associated with heavy
liftoffs"

Fermi's Paradox asked 'Where is everybody?'  meaning extraterrestrial
aliens, implying given the vastness of the universe and long time it
has existed, there should be advanced extraterrestrial civilizations
throughout the universe. The Drake equation aimed to answer that
question quantitatively, estimates how many active civilizations there
are in the galaxy right now. Using numbers by Andrew Dessler,

$$
N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L
$$

$R_*$: Number of civilizations with which humans could
communicate. Recent estimates suggest about 2 new stars are formed in
the Milky Way every year.

$f_P$: The average number of planets that can potentially support life
per star that has planets. Most stars have planets, estimate 0.9.

$N_e$: Assume 1 in 5 of stars with planets has a planet in the
habitable zone, 0.2.

$f_l$, $f_i$, $f_c$ : The fraction of planets that could support life
that actually develop life at some point, develop intelligent life,
and develop a technology that releases detectable signs. Wild guess
all 0.1.

$L$: The length of time for which such civilizations release
detectable signals. Unknown, Dessler assumes advanced civilizations
last for ten million years.

```python
"%d planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 10*1e6)
```

```text
Out[1]: '3600 planets'
```

But if "instead of 10,000,000 years, advanced civilizations last only
10,000 years", then

```python
"%d planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 10000)
```

```text
Out[1]: '3 planets'
```

If advanced civilizations last on average only 1,000 years, due to,
well perhaps some kind of catastropy hits them all, then

```python
"%0.2f planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 1000)
```

```text
Out[1]: '0.36 planets'
```

which shows why we are the only one, and "there is no one else". And
btw we will likely go extinct, lose the civilization we built before
our 1000 years are up due to the climate, nuclear war or some other
artifact of modernity.

That is the answer to "where is everyone?", they are all dead due to
one catastrophy or another, not reaching and staying at the level
where they could contact anyone alive like them (us, in this case).

When you think about it, a lot of the UFO sightings really could be

antenna arrays and planes, so the main freaky part is that they'll
appear and move impossibly quickly and completely silently. Rather
than lights (or craft) disobeying the laws of physics, it makes a lot
of sense that between our eyes not working great in the dark and

King David was a myth? 🤣 It's like the King Arthur of Brits.. that

Wiki: "In 2007.. [researchers] stated that the archaeological evidence
shows that [during the tenth century BCE] Judah was sparsely inhabited
and Jerusalem no more than a small village. The evidence suggested
that David ruled only as a chieftain over an area which cannot be
described as a state or as a kingdom, but more as a chiefdom, much
smaller and always overshadowed by the older and more powerful kingdom
of Israel to the north. They posited that Israel and Judah were not
monotheistic at the time and that later 7th-century redactors sought
to portray a past golden age of a united, monotheistic monarchy in
order to serve contemporary needs"

Jake Johnson: "Survey results released Tuesday.. show that nearly
three-quarters of millionaires in G20 countries support higher taxes
on extreme wealth, which they view as an increasingly dire threat to
democracy. The poll was conducted by the London-based firm Survation
on behalf of the Patriotic Millionaires, an advocacy group that
campaigns for a more progressive tax system. The survey, which polled
over 2,300 millionaires in G20 nations, found that 74% 'support higher
taxes on wealth to help address the cost-of-living crisis and improve
public services'...

'We, the very richest, are sick and tired of inaction, so it's hardly
surprising that working people, at the sharp end of our rigged
economies, have lost all patience,' said Guy Singh-Watson, a British
entrepreneur and member of Patriotic Millionaires U.K.

The poll was released as 260 millionaires and billionaires signed a
letter imploring the dozens of world leaders at the World Economic
Forum in Davos to raise taxes on rich people like them, warning that a
continued failure to 'address the dramatic rise of income inequality"
would be "catastrophic for society'"
