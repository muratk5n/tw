# Week 28

Corey Quinn: "I was in New York this week for the AWS Summit.. I know,
I know–all of the industry is currently consumed by a paroxysm of
GenAI hype.. However, the badge lanyards were GenAI branded, the
keynote opening slide simply said 'Generative AI,' and every single
offering discussed during the ~98 minute keynote was centered around
Generative AI. Nearly every expo hall booth was dripping with GenAI;
Elastic even went so far as to rebrand itself as 'The Search AI
company.'..

[AI] fails to state a compelling business case. There has to be
downstream value derived from any business initiative. Terms like
'transformation' are bandied around cheaply; so far all of the value
business that I’ve spoken with are deriving from GenAI initiatives
represent evolutionary steps rather than revolutionary steps.. the
hyperfocus on GenAI is concerning to me because of what’s being
shunted aside to create room for it..

They’re Amazon WEB Services, not Amazon GenAI Services. I fix large
AWS bills for large enterprises for a living; my customers have a raft
of very large-scale challenges that don’t involve GenAI in the
slightest. Two years ago the AWS event keynotes were full of offerings
that made solid strides towards assuaging those customer
concerns. This year there was none of that; the non-GenAI section of
the keynote simply didn’t exist"

Roddenberry's universe has no money. The first TNG season was a little
rough around the edges but the ep *The Neutral Zone*'s message was
clear.

---

Roddenberry was probably a Europhile. For TNG he picked a British
actor as the Captain, and gave him the backstory of a Frenchman. The
crew has uniforms, w/ ranks creating the air of a culture descending
from a militocracy, not trading (that was the Ferrengi). The first
officer acted the brash American type (every scifi needs its Han Solo)
but Riker was Canadian according to Trek canon. Canadians are of
course bizarre, un-American, weird.

"Ariane 6 uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as fuel for its main
and upper stages...  ESA and France’s space agency CNES wish to switch
to solar-powered electrolysis of water [to produce green hydrogen as
rocket fuel].. Project Hyguane – a portmanteau of the French words for
hydrogen, French Guiana and the local Iguanas – is a €40.5M investment
in a solar farm and distribution systems and is being designed to be
allowed to easily expand in the future"

---

"The upper stage [of Ariane 6] is powered by the reignitable Vinci
engine fueled by cryogenic liquid oxygen and hydrogen. This allows
Ariane 6 to reach a range of orbits on a single mission, and deliver
more payloads. The upper stage will typically burn one, two or more
times to reach targeted orbits. After payload separation, the upper
stage will perform a de-orbit maneuver, in order to mitigate space
debris"

Politico: "Under the ranked-choice system, voters pick up to five
candidates ranked in order or preference. If no one gets a majority on
the first ballot, the last place candidate is eliminated and their
votes are distributed to the voter’s second choice, a process that
continues until one candidate claims more than 50 percent"

---

Is the French two-round system for parliament democratic, especially
the way it was used recently, some parties conspired to boot out
National Rally? Some could argue non-NR parties created a virtual
ranked-choice voting system... Instead of second, third choices being
counted via a computational elimination system, some parties, through
a conspiracy, did it for the voters. But that's the key point - those
parties made the choice for the voter. Under a ranked-choice system
the winner with the most votes usually wins the elimination
computation. When NR is involved in France, they lose more than they
win. The conspiracy's outcome is officially democratic, but it smells
funky.

"eXERO process [of Utility Global] is the first time a
zero-electricity electrolysis process converts sustainable waste
streams directly into high-purity, low-cost hydrogen. The process is
achieved by removing the external electrical circuit from the
electrolyzer and instead controlling the reaction using the
overpotential (voltage) that exists between the different gas
compositions. Similar to a conventional solid oxide electrolyser,
water is reduced at the cathode to hydrogen and oxygen ions. The
oxygen ions are then transferred through an electrolyte that conducts
the oxygen ions. However, unlike a conventional electrochemical
reactor, electrons are transferred through a conductive phase within
the electrolyte, rather than through an external circuit"

He was. I suspect he might've even been led there, at least, his
passport cancellation done at a key moment to have him be stuck at
that location. It sure beats Belmarsh. His was the lesser "crime"
after all, telling on the government, embarrassing them. Assange's was
worse, he outed the entire military-industrial private media complex,
and unearthed their dealings.

Modern science is falsifiable. Carroll wants a new science that
doesn't require falsifiability so his theories become automatically
valid. But then any god-damn theory is valid... Anyone can pull
theories out of their ass and claim they are correct. Science cannot
be conducted this way.

---

Voit, *Not Even Wrong*: "[2018] Sean Carroll has a new paper out
defending the Multiverse and attacking the naive Popperazi [followers
of Popper], entitled *Beyond Falsifiability: Normal Science in a
Multiverse*... Much of the problem with the paper and blog post is
that Carroll is.. ignoring the serious arguments about the problems
with multiverse research"

---

Sean Carroll is a total crank, no doubt about it.. His dubious
theories cannot be proven, but he doubles down, writes a paper with
words "Beyond Falsifiability" in it, saying the definition of science
is wrong. Think about what he is saying here: his bizarro theories
cannot prove anything, so he says the definition of science has to
change to **suit him**. That is the absolute low, bottom of the barrel
for science and specifically American science. A certain culture
created this guy with a giant L. The uber-dreamy exploration in all
things, wout checking, wout verification, senseless imaginification
brought you here.. That's why I argue the stewardship of bleeding-edge
science needs to leave US and go back to where it started, Eurasia.

Some are protesting the scotus "immunity from official acts" decision

testing to commercially-sized systems.  Oxford NanoSystems’ (ONS)
so-called 'nanoFlux' alloy coating encourages the formation of more,
smaller bubbles on the electrodes within an electrolyser, which in
turn allow more electrons to move throughout the system — enabling the
use of higher electrical currents and more hydrogen production in any
given time period"

Plot against FDR! Is this the Deep State?

It sounds more like a Merchantile State.

Jesse Ventura: "[intro from the book *War Is A Racket*] President
Roosevelt’s New Deal was considered anti-American and evil by the Wall
Street crowd.. The president was taking on the stock speculators and
setting up new watchdog federal agencies. He was putting a halt on
farm foreclosures and forcing employers to accept union collective
bargaining... he even spoke of raising taxes on the rich to help pay
for New Deal programs.

So a lot of titans of finance hated the man’s guts. [War hero Smedley]
Butler even suspected some of them might have been behind a failed
assassination attempt against him shortly before he was elected
president. Then one day in 1934, to Butler’s surprise, a bond salesman
named Gerry MacGuire approached him... some captains of industry [had
come] together and announced they were forming a new American Liberty
League that September. Its stated goals were 'to combat radicalism, to
teach the necessity of respect for the rights of persons and property,
and generally to foster free private enterprise.' The League’s backers
included Rockefellers, Mellons, and Pews.. [and they wanted to arrange
a government takeover]...

[W]ho was their choice to lead a government takeover?.. Smedley
Butler. They knew how popular he was with veterans, and the idea was
to have Smedley come out of retirement and lead another veterans’
'Bonus Army' march on the nation’s capital. They wanted to create
havoc with as many as five hundred thousand men at Butler’s
heels. Pressured by these events, so the twisted thinking went, FDR
would be convinced to name Butler to a new cabinet post as a secretary
of 'general affairs' or 'general welfare.' Eventually, the president
would agree to 19turn over the reins of power to Butler altogether,
under the excuse that his polio was worsening, and FDR would become a
mere ceremonial figurehead..

[Butler] decided to bring a reporter friend in on the conspiracy, so
it wouldn’t be just his word against the plotters’, and they worked
together to gather more background [later outed the plotters,
testified] before the House McCormack-Dickstein Committee.. But then
the committee’s investigation came to a sudden stop and none of the
alleged financiers were ever called for questioning. In fact, when the
transcript of the committee’s interview with Butler came out, every
person he’d named ended up being deleted"

Can the war be useful for Zelensky to get out from under the thumb of
oligarchs? He can use his war-time leader image, plus war destroys
oligarch wealth decreasing their influence. Maybe. There were
indications VZ wanted peace back in 2022 but was talked out of it by
the international weapons cartel (via their tools in US/UK). It's
possible but will there be a Ukraine standing by that point?

---

Ironically US played a role corrupting Ukraine for the benefit of its
private stakeholders. Ukranian oligarchs ran Ukraine, who were in turn
controlled by US 'proconsuls' like Victoria Nuland. The entire corrupt
system survived because of and for United States. Zelensky became
president thanks to an oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Then the bear came
down knocking, everyone lost their shit.

H2 Central: "SK E&S Unveils South Korea’s First Liquid Hydrogen
Refueling Station in Gyeonggi Province.. Strategically located within

primarily serve the company’s employee shuttle buses, marking a
significant step in implementing the “ESG Leading Companies Hydrogen
Commuter Bus Conversion Agreement” signed in May of last year.

The agreement, involving the Ministry of Environment, major
corporations, local governments, and transportation companies, aims to
convert over 2,000 existing internal combustion engine commuter buses
to hydrogen buses by 2026.

The Icheon station will receive its liquid hydrogen supply from SK
E&S’s Incheon Liquid Hydrogen Plant, which opened in May. This plant,
the world’s largest single-factory liquid hydrogen production
facility, can produce 30,000 tons of liquid hydrogen annually"

is Rmb7.898 million, or 219 dollar per KW ($1=Rmb7.2). The bidding

Politico: "Farage’s party’s string of second-place finishes,

voters’ lives as he promises, who will Reform voters punish?

Farage was explicit about who he’ll be gunning for in the next
election, which must be held by 2029. 'We’re coming for Labour — be in
no doubt about that,' he said in his victory speech in Clacton leisure
center. 'This is the first steps in something which is going to stun

enemy. Therefore anyone supporting the raproachment indirectly
supports a defanged Israel.

Monbiot: "What is the 'normal' envisaged by pundits and politicians of
the left and centre? It is the most anomalous politics in the history
of the world. Consciously or otherwise, they hark back to a remarkable
period, roughly 1945 to 1975, in which, in certain rich nations,
wealth and power were distributed, almost everyone could aspire to
decent housing, wages and conditions, public services were ambitious
and well-funded and a robust economic safety net prevented
destitution. There had never been a period like it in the prior
history of the world, and there has not been one since...

In the absence of one of the four great catastrophes, income and
capital inexorably accumulate in the hands of the few, and oligarchy
returns. Oligarchs are people who translate their inordinate economic
power into inordinate political power. They build a politics that
suits them. Scheidel shows that as inequality rises, so does
polarisation and political dysfunction, both of which favour the very
rich, as a competent, proactive state is a threat to their
interests...

Oligarchs seek the destruction of oversight, which is why UK bodies
such as the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive
have been comprehensively gutted. The same desire was the driving
force behind Brexit. They want the cessation of protest. They want a
failing NHS, to justify privatisation. They want malleable politicians
and a tame BBC. They get what they want, distorting every aspect of
national life. They pour money into [extreme] political movements,
which help capital to solve its perennial problem: democracy. The arc
of history bends towards injustice. But every so often it is broken
over the knee of catastrophe"

Forbes: "Vietnam’s All-Out Hydrogen Gambit.. In April 2024, Vietnam
and the United States embarked upon one of the world’s most ambitious
green hydrogen collaborative strategies. The [USAID] and [SC] Bank
Vietnam signed a [MOU] to support Vietnam’s transition towards a
hydrogen-centric renewable energy model. Building upon President Joe
Biden’s visit to Hanoi in September 2023, this MOU aims to facilitate
private-sector investment and help Vietnam achieve its net-zero
emission goals by 2050...

The Vietnamese strategy for hydrogen power..  aims at nothing less
than overturning the canon of hydrogen development. It aims to produce
up to 500,000 tons of hydrogen annually by 2030 and 10-20 million tons
of hydrogen annually by 2050. This would be equivalent to the UK’s
current annual electricity consumption. Most importantly, Vietnam
wants to use not just 'green hydrogen,' which is hydrogen fuel
generated by renewable energy sources, but it wants to position
hydrogen as the center of a modern energy ecosystem"
