<p>The American Prospect: "The Airbus Advantage.. Why Europe’s mixed
economy produces safer planes than America’s financialized
capitalism.. Airbus’s clear leadership over Boeing in matters of
flight safety stem in good measure from their differences in ownership
and worker power—that is, from the European model of mitigating
laissez-faire capitalism with a measure of public and worker power,
and from the American model of subjecting corporate policy almost
entirely to the demands of investment institutions"</p>

<p>Turchin, <em>End Times</em>: "A key development in shutting down the wealth
pump [that transfers money from low income to high-income] was the
passage of the immigration laws of 1921 and 1924. Although much of the
proximate motivation behind these laws was to exclude 'dangerous
aliens,' such as Italian anarchists and Eastern European socialists,
their broader effect was a reduction in labor oversupply, something
that business elites were well aware of. Shutting down immigration
reduced the labor supply and provided a powerful boost to real wages
for many decades to come.</p>

<p>Being a "Semite" doesn't automatically imply Zionist, nor you are
scheming to end up in powerful positions. The majority manuevers them
into those positions, just like the disproportionate Catholic presence
at scotus, Jews can be overrepresented in some places. Need to
understand how the private industrial-Likud-complex thinks.. They
would prefer a guy who could be <em>a little more</em> anti-government due to
his minority status (as in scotus), <em>a little more</em> pro-genocide,
pro-Zionist due to this religious affiliation... These fuckers play
the odds. Very smart.. and they've been winning the long-game aren't
they?</p>

<p>"The Obama-Biden administration" seems to have dropped the ball,
missed a huge chance. </p>
<p>Andersen: "[The Obama] administration and the Democratic congressional
leadership seem to have punted when it came to pushing for a law that
included a 'public option,' some form of Medicare-for-anybody coverage
that people could buy as an alternative to private insurance. For his
first few months in office, Obama seemed to be all for it, as did all
the Democratic chairs of all the congressional committees that would
create the reform law. But the insurance industry and the physicians’
trade group, the American Medical Association, were against it. The
most conservative Democrats in the House, the Blue Dog Coalition, were
iffy, but only a dozen of those fifty would be required to pass a
bill. Over the summer, however, Obama got publicly wobbly on the
public option—as Paul Krugman wrote at the time, “weirdly unable to
show passion on the issue, weirdly diffident even about the blatant
lies from the right”—and by Labor Day, the Democrats surrendered.</p>
<p>That same summer of 2009, Democrats also gave in to big business in an
important showdown with organized labor. A bill was moving through
Congress that had a provision to make unionization easier—instead of
winning a secret-ballot referendum in a workplace, labor organizers
would just have to convince a majority of the workers face-to-face to
sign up. The Business Roundtable lobbied hard against it. A few
moderate Democratic senators were persuaded—and without their votes
the forty Senate Republicans could kill the whole bill by sticking
together and filibustering it, so despite the (theoretically)
filibuster-proof majority, it got dropped. A year later big business
was still making sure that the measure stayed dead: on Business
Roundtable letterhead, the CEOs of Verizon and Caterpillar warned
Obama’s budget director that any such change remained “foremost among
our companies’ labor concerns” because it would have “a devastating
impact on business” and “significantly and negatively impact global
competitiveness, job creation and economic recovery.” As it happened,
six weeks after he got that letter, the OMB director left the
administration and soon went to work for a member of the Business
Roundtable, the CEO of Citigroup, as his vice-chairman of corporate
and investment banking"</p>

<p>If WWI caused WWII then there isn't much to learn from the second
war... Even the rise of fascism is, leaving aside the atrocities, a
symptom, an after-effect and we won't learn much from
after-effects. If people are in a bad situation economically, anything
can happen.. That should not be suprising. "Preparing" for the
after-effect, Nazism and such, is less effective than curing the
conditions that caused it. But the corp propagandists already know
that, they use misdirection, gaslighting for a reason. </p>

<p>Woodword was used like a chump in the process of Watergate. One of
modern journalism's main job is uncovering secrets, obviously the US
private complex and its surface state has the best ones.. But if you
are getting secrets from such sources, who is leaking to you, why? You
could be privy to info for a purpose, IMO that is exactly what the
confidential source did to Woodward. He was led around by the nose,
used, to take down someone who was essentially a good
president. Woodword's reporting was essentially a disservice to
society. He did better on his later books; but Watergate is a black
mark on his record.</p>

<p>Whistleblower: "Apple's Secret Silicon Fab Next to Thousands of

and toxic gases straight from the roof and into the ambient outdoor
air, with little or no abatement. The factory was only one story while
the apartments were four stories tall, nearly ensuring the factory
exhaust entered the apartment windows and 'fresh air intake' vents.</p>
<p>​Gjovik lived at these apartments in 2020 and found herself in the

<p>Doctorow: "The Cult of Mac: You cannot reason a person out of a
position they did not reason themself into in the first place...</p>
<p>Big Tech most assuredly steals from the news: it steals money. The
ad-tech duopoly takes 51% out of every ad dollar. Social media holds
news subscribers to ransom and requires "boosting" payment to reach
the people who've asked to see their articles. And the mobile duopoly
takes 30% out of every in-app subscription dollar:</p>
<p>The mobile duopoly likes to talk about the "mobile ecosystem," but
it's no ecosystem – it's a pair of walled gardens:</p>
<p>It's a planned economy run by a pair of corporate executives who
deliberate in secret and are accountable only to their
shareholders. Thankfully, some regulators are alive to the hazards of
this technofeudal arrangement and are taking firm measures:</p>
<p>These regulators couch their enforcement action in terms of defending
an open market, but the benefits to app makers is only incidental. The
real beneficiaries of an open app world is Apple customers. After all,
it's Apple customers who bear the 30% app tax when it's priced into
the apps they buy and the things they buy in those apps. It's Apple
customers who lose access to apps that can't be viably offered because
the app tax makes them money-losing propositions. It's Apple customers
who lose out on the ability to get apps that Apple decides are
unsuitable for inclusion in its App Store.</p>
<p>That's where the Cult Of Mac steps in to cape for the $3 trillion
behemoth. The minority of Apple customers for whom their brand loyalty
is a form of religious devotion insist that "no Apple customer wants
these things."</p>

<p>Americans usually look at EU laws from their by-the-letter, precedence

'clever' way ('Look, I do just what you said! Happy now?'). While I
don't expect American tech bloggers to understand European law or how
they pedal populist anti EU propaganda, I expected more from Apple's

<p>"In 1987, [new junta leader supported by US] Namphy received IMF loans
valued at $24.6 million in exchange for agreeing to slash rice tariffs
from 150% to 50%, the lowest in the Caribbean. He opened all of
Haiti’s ports to commercial activity and agreed to stop what little
support the government had offered Haitian farmers. Meanwhile, Haiti’s
military elite saw an opportunity to make a profit smuggling American
rice.. In the United States, the passage of the 1985 Farm Bill
significantly boosted subsidies to American rice growers. By 1987, 40%
of American rice growers' profits came from the government. Heavily
subsidized American rice could sell at prices far below the market
value of Haitian rice. Haitian farmers never stood a chance against
this unfair competition".. In Haiti, imported American rice is called
'Miami rice' because it is shipped from Miami in sacks stamped 'Miami,
FLA.' By December 1987, Haiti’s rice production had shrunk to 75% of
Haitian needs"</p>

that the National City Bank of New York is very much interested in
Haiti. It is necessary to know that the National City Bank controls
the National Bank of Haiti and is the depository for all of the
