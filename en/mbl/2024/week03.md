# Week 3


The commercial cannot exist without the free. It's time this fact is
acknowledged and properly rewarded, at the very least, the existing
system is amended so people who create the commercial products are
rewarded less (money is not an absolute value but defines distribution
right?).

"The value of a non-pecuniary (free) product is inherently difficult to
assess. A pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global
public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational
for most technology we use today... We estimate.. the demand-side
value [replacement value for each firm that uses the software of OSS]
is.. at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5
times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist."

A better label for the complex is a "surface state", these people
supported by a shady donor class can grab a political post here and
there at the top, install certain people at some gov posts, but they
are mostly at the outer edges albeit sometimes in powerful
positions. Remember the Cheney - J. Wilson debacle. JW blew the
whistle on the Iraq War evidence Saddam had WMD etc) and Cheney's
people, likely directed by him, outed his wife at the CIA. Well if
Cheney type people were "in the deep", as in state, couldn't they
handle business other ways? In that scenario Wilson would not speak.
His wife would be "taken care of". It would be a done deal. That did
not happen. This is why looking for bad actors at the depths is
incorrect. At lower levels there are a lot of good officials, like
that Josh Paul, ppl with principles. There are many like him. The
donors, "the complex" at the exec level can manuever the occasional
Secretary, a VP, or sometimes a President into a position, but it is
harder for them to reach the internal workings of the state. US is not
an empire, nor has a deep state. Politically, it is just a concoction
of short-sighted private actors that only care about immediate
profits, a donor supported, partly corrupt "surface state" that
unfortunately is leading everyone to ruin.

---

*Vice*, Bernstein: "Cheney’s contempt for the Central Intelligence
Agency has its roots in the Ford administration. Cheney believed the
agency, like Dr. Kissinger, was soft on the Soviet Union. So Cheney
and Rumsfeld colluded with a clique of right-wing academics— which
would grow into the neocon movement"

---

That doesn't mean anything. Dick Cheney did not like the CIA either,
he is still alive and kicking. Some others do not like the FBI, or
ICE. It doesn't immediately imply "they will kill you". JFK provided
ample funding for the military, a lot of interests had reasons to keep
him alive. He died because he was retarded, like everyone else in his
family. These people have a genetic defect. 

"But JFK did not like the CIA, that is likely why they'd want him dead"

---

JFK was an extremely bad president, but his image proved useful for
the complex. Think about it, he was rich, then killed in a way that
led many "imaginative" boomers at the time to suspect government
(because gov is bad, does bad things, be scared). And what is the
overriding ideology of the post-Berlin Wall neoliberal world?
Pro-rich and anti-government. Boom. Enter JFK adulation.

The boom in LLMs is going to hollow out a number of knowledge-worker
industries — for example, writing boilerplate code or technical
documentation

Not because it does it well but because the flacks can sell upper
management on the idea that it can do it at all, as @doctorow recently
pointed out

This sale is a pig-in-a-poke, and the winning move is to not be
holding the bag when the actual code or documentation is found to be
terrible

But there isn't really a winning move if you're one of the people
getting hollowed out — for us, the game is survival until the grift
collapses"

No spending cut, "thriftiness" can tame that debt. There is only one place

US federal spending in 2022 was around 6 trillion, the interest
payments of the debt are now a big chunk of that. Once interest
payments overwhelm the annual spending itself, some people are
going to start scratching their heads, and be forced to make some
tough choices.

Pikkety talked about a wealth tax in his *Capital in the Twenty-first Century*, 2014. 
It is doable.

Stevenson: "The tax system as it is is not really designed to tax
people whose income comes from wealth.. there is huge amount of wealth
in this country, not just housing but also commercial wealth, land,
shopping centers, office buildings, factories.. these are owned by
richer people, they generate enourmous amount of income from [it].
With the way the tax system is designed it is possible for rich people
to generate huge amounts of income from wealth, and to legally avoid a
lot of tax. They [certainly] don't have to pay income tax on most of
wealth based income. The end result is these people in many cases pay
rates as low as 10% or sometimes even lower, on the income from their
wealth.

What we actually have is a tax system that is progressive for ordinary
people, the rate is higher the more you earn, and once you get into
the realm of.. wealthy people, the rate starts to collapse.

I think it's it's quite interesting that.. the tax system is kind of
moving back towards.. Medieval Times where essentially working people
pay tax to the aristocracy.. Increasingly a big chunk of the tax that
you pay literally goes towards paying government debt interest to the
rich. You pay your tax - a lot of that goes to the rich then you pay
your rent - that goes to the rich you pay your mortgage - that goes to
rich you go to buy food and that goes to the landowners, you buy
energy and that goes to the energy owners..  [this] looks increasing
like a very extractive system..

The lack of taxation of the rich creates a big problem with flows of
wealth. Recently I've been really trying to lobby politicians, 
unsuccessfully, to start taxing wealth, tax working people less on
their income and tax wealth more.. I've been trying to push them to
tax people who have a wealth of over £10 million; 1% of their wealth,
and they don't [even] want to do that. But wealthy people will make
three, four, five percent income on their wealth anyway, so.. even if
you were to tax them one percent they would still generate an enormous
excess income that they could then use to compete with your kids to
buy property...

I should probably just talk briefly about VAT & NI.  [UK] National
Insurance is a form of income tax that only applies to working people,
only applies to work..  National Insurance [is] specifically targeted
at working people, then you have VAT which is on consumption, now very
rich people consume very very small percentage of their income so they
pay very little VAT.. VAT is targeted at ordinary people, National
Insurance targeted at working people. Income Tax [is] avoidable for
the rich, Inheritance Tax [is] avoidable for the rich.. The end result
is you have a tax system which looks progressive for ordinary people
because you're only comparing yourself to people around you who are
ordinary people at the same time you have this small group of people
who are phenomenally rich who are increasingly buying everything you
don't often get to see in day-to-day life that they are paying
nothing, generating huge amounts of income and using that income to
buy the rest of the assets. Who pays tax? If you're a working person
in an ordinary financial situation - YOU! Who doesn't pay tax? Very
wealthy families, the people who receive your mortgage payments your
rent payments, the money you spend on food and bills. They don't pay
any tax on that and they are then using that money to buy the rest of
the wealth, so it creates this really bad structural problem..

If we don't take any action against that, it is inevitable that in 20
years, 30 years, ordinary families will not have any assets left
basically. It will be very difficult to own property and if you do own
property you'll be forced to have an enormous mortgage"

"@emilymbender@dair-community.social

It is depressing how often Bender & Koller 2020 is cited
incorrectly. My best guess as to why this is is that people writing
about whether or not LLMs 'understand' or 'are agents' have such
strongly held beliefs about what they want to be true..

[We are cited] in this string: 'Do modern LLMs have beliefs, desires,
and intentions?..'

But we are emphatically not writing about LLMs having beliefs, desires
and intentions. We were debunking claims that LLMs
'understand'. Inasmuch as their apparent understanding is part of what
misleads people into attributing beliefs, desires, and intentions to
them"

Jason Velazquez: "Where have all the websites gone?.. Somewhere
between the late 2000’s aggregator sites and the contemporary For You
Page, we lost our ability to curate the web. Worse still, we’ve
outsourced our discovery to corporate algorithms. Most of us did it in
exchange for an endless content feed... Who wouldn’t want a steady
stream of dopamine shots?

The rest of us, posters, amplifiers, and aggregators, traded our
discovery autonomy for a chance at fame and fortune. Not all, but
enough to change the social web landscape.

But that gold at the end of the rainbow isn’t for us. “Creator funds”
pull from a fixed pot. It’s a line item in a budget that doesn’t
change, whether one hundred or one million hands dip inside
it. Executives in polished cement floor offices, who you’ll never
meet, choose their winners and losers. And I’m guessing it’s not a
meritocracy-based system. They pick their tokens, round up their
shills, and stuff Apple Watch ads between them"

Tisdall, The Guardian: "Biden alienated global (and much American)
opinion by rashly pledging unconditional support to Israel after the

China and Russia are Iran’s new best friends. And it’s this, more than
other factors, that has transformed Iran’s fortunes, making it a power
to be reckoned with. The Ukraine invasion, and the prior Sino-Russian
