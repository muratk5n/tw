Bair: "The year 2009 brought with it a new president, Barack Obama. I
was desperately hoping that the new administration would rethink some
of the bailout policies we were pursuing and would do more to help
distressed homeowners. Unfortunately, that was not to be. President
Obama promised to launch stronger programs to prevent foreclosures,
and I really think that helping these families was a priority for
him. But I do not believe that the people he picked for major economic
positions in his administration shared those priorities.

Much to my surprise and disappointment, he picked Tim Geithner to
replace Hank Paulson as the new secretary of the Treasury. Throughout
the crisis, Tim’s singular focus had been to bail out the big banks,
and in particular, Citi. He had shown little interest in foreclosure
prevention or any other kind of direct help for Main Street. He viewed
the big banks as the center of our economy, and equated helping them
with helping the broader economy. He did not understand that their
interests and Main Street interests were separate, and that helping
big banks did not necessarily help struggling American families.

President Obama also picked Larry Summers, another close associate of
Bob Rubin, to head the National Economic Council, or “NEC,” which was
responsible for developing economic policy for the White
House. Summers had also once served as secretary of the Treasury and
had been a supporter of legislation to block regulation of the
derivatives markets. In addition, he had backed legislation to repeal
a Depression-era law called “Glass-Steagall,” which for decades had
prohibited FDIC-insured banks from engaging in risky securities
activities. Based on Summers’s record, I also viewed him as highly
sympathetic to the big banks"

Unfettered immigration is problematic on many fronts.. First is the
mentality of who arrives. Most people fled from a place likely did not
like the government of the place they are from, so they arrive in US
not liking the concept of government. An anti-government sentiment can
spread through immigrants. Plus when they arrive they are happy to be
working at all, they do not ask anything, they are either low-wage
earners who don't complain undermining local unions, or they become
"enterpreneurs" becoming ultra pro-business jackasses of which US does
not need more of either. Any way you look at it, unfettered
immigration is a net negative.

Mondoweiss: "The reason Israel’s die-hard supporters in the United
States have tried to ban, or even criminalize, the campaign for
Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) is not that it is
illegitimate or anti-semitic. It is precisely because boycotting,
sanctioning ,and divesting from Israel may be an effective strategy to
help bring down its genocidal, expansionist, and unaccountable regime"

---

Mondoweiss: "Following the previous U.S. veto of a ceasefire at the
Security Council, the UN General Assembly took up the global call for
a ceasefire, and the resolution, sponsored by Jordan, passed by 120
votes to 14, with 45 abstentions. The 12 small countries who voted
with the United States and Israel represented less than 1% of the
world’s population. The isolated diplomatic position in which the
United States found itself should have been a wake-up call..

After the United States again slammed the Security Council door in
Palestine’s face on December 8, the desperate need to end the massacre
in Gaza returned to the UN General Assembly on December 12. An
identical resolution to the one the U.S. vetoed in the Security
Council was approved by a vote of 153 to 10, with 33 more yes votes
than the one in October. While General Assembly resolutions are not
binding, they do carry political weight, and this one sends a clear
message that the international community is disgusted by the carnage
in Gaza"

Latent space is usually a reduced dimension, sometimes a decomposition

---

LLM can be useful for a sort of glorifed search where "chatting" with
the thing actually searches in "a latent space" as Howard calls it, a
likely useful compressed space of knowledge that might give you better
results compared to a regular search. LLM is not thinking, it is
merely indexing knowledge, that could be useful in limited, focused
applications.

2. The ideas in this post are literally a mechanism for taking away

The bubble will only get more ridiculous before it pops. We’re still
in early days yet. That somebody who is ostensibly a political
“moderate” outright advocates a system that would replace voting with
an opaque system that would inevitably be built and designed by
multinational corporations and implicitly favour their interests is
not even close to the peak of this nonsense marathon"

probably nuanced, trading off between different options and their
effects. You care about some issues more than others and some
implementations more than others. If you had the knowledge and time,
you could engage in the deliberative process and help create better

Vox: "To explain leveraged buyouts in easier-to-understand terms,
let’s say you buy a house. Under normal circumstances, if you can’t
pay for the mortgage, you would be in trouble. But by the LBO rules,
you’re only responsible for a portion. If you pay for 30 percent of
the house, the other 70 percent of the asking price is debt placed on
the house. The house owes that money to the bank or creditor who lent
it, not you. Of course, a house can’t owe money. But under the private
equity model, it does, and its assets — its factories, stores,
equipment, etc. — are collateral.

The idea, in theory, behind private equity is that the endeavor will
be worth it — for both you and the house. 'There are many companies
that, if not for private equity, would not be able to get access to
the kind of capital they need to scale, to transform, to turn around,
and to have succession planning,' said one industry source, who
requested anonymity to speak candidly for this story.

But because of the debt companies end up owing creditors as part of a
deal, they sometimes find themselves with such high interest payments
that they can’t make the investments necessary to be competitive or
even stay afloat. Plus, companies often take out additional loans to
pay private equity investors dividends, and then they pay a fee if and
when they are sold. If they can’t pay off the debt, the companies are
on the hook, and their employees and customers are the ones to suffer
the consequences.

And private equity’s No. 1 priority isn’t the long-term health of the
companies it buys — it’s to make money, and as is the case in so many
facets of investing today, to make money fast.

'Some of the larger private equity firms, they’re not retaining
investments in the long-term. They are designed to produce short-term
returns, and if there is nothing left of the company at the end,
that’s okay,' said Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) in an interview.

NYT: "[C]ritics both within Israel and outside have questioned whether
resolving to destroy such a deeply entrenched organization [as Hamas]
was ever realistic. One former Israeli national security adviser
called the plan 'vague'. 'I think that we have reached a moment when
the Israeli authorities will have to define more clearly what their
final objective is,' President Emmanuel Macron of France said this
month. 'The total destruction of Hamas? Does anybody think that’s
possible? If it’s that, the war will last 10 years.' Since it first
emerged in 1987, Hamas has survived repeated attempts to eliminate its
leadership. The organization’s very structure was designed to absorb
such contingencies, according to political and military
specialists. In addition, Israel’s devastating tactics in the Gaza war
threaten to radicalize a broader segment of the population, inspiring
new recruits"

Andersen: "As antitrust enforcement was discredited and enfeebled
starting in the 1970s, big corporations were able to get so big and
dominant in their business or regions that they had ever fewer
companies directly competing with them to hire workers. More and more
of them became the only games in town. One of the scholars who has
helped expose this particular bit of rigging and its unfairness over
the last several decades is the influential, idiosyncratic University
of Chicago law professor Eric Posner. As he and his economist
co-author Glen Weyl explain, antitrust laws were enacted to make sure
that businesses compete in every way—not just as sellers setting the
prices they charge for products and services, but also as buyers of
labor setting the salaries they pay.

The appeal of antitrust for citizens was to make sure competition kept
prices lower and salaries higher. Enforcement of our antitrust laws,
however, has come to focus entirely on consumer prices, particularly
since the definitive Borking of the field in the late 1970s. The
antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission, because they rely 'on the traditional assumption that
labor markets are competitive,' and that it wasn’t their jobs to
protect workers anyhow, 'have never blocked a merger because of its
effect on labor,' and they don’t even employ experts who could
calculate those effects"
