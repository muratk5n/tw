Andersen: "[O]ver the last half-century, antitrust violations were
redefined to mean only corporate actions specifically intended to

the founders can elevate a buggy, unproven, or partially conceived
technology into the cultural firmament, even if only briefly. It's a
cheat code, a way of getting us to relate to a future that's already
been culturally prototyped, and it can be quite successful"

embedded platform QNX, Apple Airport too (why they did not use their

net routers also use it. The announcement below will open some eyes.

"In February, Honda unveiled the production version of its CR-V

Manufacturing (FCSM), based in Michigan. With a range of 372 miles on
a full tank of hydrogen.. and a refuelling time akin to that of a
petrol or diesel car, [it] is built in Ohio at Honda’s Performance
Manufacturing Centre.

Deaton, *Economics in America*: "Wealthy minorities often block public
provision of entitlement-like pensions or of healthcare because they
do not want to pay taxes for them and do not need them for themselves
or their families. Pharma companies lobby for extended patent
protection to keep prices high, and wealthy partners in private equity
firms lobby to preserve the tax breaks for their incomes by labeling
them as capital gains. Banks lobby for rules that allow them to keep
profits but share their losses. The American Medical Association
restricts the number of places in medical schools [.. to] keep
doctors’ salaries higher than they would be in a competitive
market. Credit card companies are allowed, by the Supreme Court no
less, to prevent retailers from giving discounts to people who pay
cash, so that less well-off people who do not use cards are paying for
the free air tickets and other benefits that credit card companies
provide to their members. States have made it illegal for anyone other
than dealers to sell automobiles, so manufacturers cannot sell
direct. And so on.

If this kind of lobbying and granting of special favors could be
restricted— and campaign finance reform would help—inequality would be
reduced, even without changes in taxes"

---

Andersen: "'When I started in this business,' [Milton] Friedman told
.. [to a conference] attendees [in 1998] 'as a believer in
competition, I was a great supporter of antitrust laws. I thought
enforcing them was one of the few desirable things that the government
could do to promote more competition.' But Friedman said his 'views
about the antitrust laws have changed greatly over time' because, he
claimed, the government had never enforced them aggressively
enough. So disingenuous, and so typical of libertarians who really
don’t believe in competition as much as in disapproving of government
and letting big business have its way"

---

NYT: "It's a little hard to believe that just over a year ago, a group
of leading researchers asked for a six-month pause in the development
of larger systems of artificial intelligence, fearing that the systems
would become too powerful. 'Should we risk loss of control of our
civilization?' they asked. There was no pause. But now, a year later,
the question isn't really whether A.I. is too smart and will take over
the world. It's whether A.I. is too stupid and unreliable to be
useful. Consider this week's announcement from OpenAI's chief
executive, Sam Altman, who promised he would unveil 'new stuff' that
'feels like magic to me.' But it was just a rather routine
update... Given these constraints, it seems just as likely to me that
generative A.I. could end up like the Roomba, the mediocre vacuum
robot that does a passable job when you are home alone but not if you
are expecting guests"

General Gerasimov, Chief of the RU General Staff: "[2013] What is
modern war?  What should the army be prepared for?  How should it be
armed?  Only after answering these questions can we determine the
directions of the construction and development of the armed forces
over the long term. To do this, it is essential to have a clear
understanding of the forms and methods of the use of the application
of force.

These days, together with traditional devices, nonstandard ones are
being developed. The role of mobile, mixed-type groups of forces,
acting in a single intelligence-information space because of the use
of the new possibilities of command-and-control systems has been
strengthened. Military actions are becoming more dynamic, active, and
fruitful. Tactical and operational pauses that the enemy could exploit
are disappearing. New information technologies have enabled
significant reductions in the spatial, temporal, and informational
gaps between forces and control organs. Frontal engagements of large
formations of forces at the strategic and operational level are
gradually becoming a thing of the past. Long-distance, contactless
actions against the enemy are becoming the main means of achieving
combat and operational goals. The defeat of the enemy’s objects is
conducted throughout the entire depth of his territory. The
differences between strategic, operational, and tactical levels, as
well as between offensive and defensive operations, are being
erased. The application of high-precision weaponry is taking on a mass
character. Weapons based on new physical principals and automatized
systems are being actively incorporated into military activity"

Due to winds the particulate stuff migrates to south Europe too..
Massively bad.  It would be great if all of N. Africa was greened,

"Africa experiences some of the worst air pollution and some of the
most severe health consequences in the world. In 2019, air pollution
was the second leading risk factor for death across Africa, a large
and dynamic continent that is home to more than 1.2 billion people. In
terms of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), 5 of the world’s 10
most heavily polluted countries are in Africa.. Desert dust, also
referred to as sand and dust storms, is a mixture of particulate
matter from desert or arid areas. In the Sahara and Sahel regions of
North Africa, as well as in Western Africa, windblown dust is a
significant contributor to total PM2.5"

Hinton, LeCun are two of the three "Godfathers of AI" - the press
keeps conflating one approach in machine learning with all of AI, but
anyway, as far as deep neural nets go, these guys are the top. Perhaps
LeCun more so than the rest.

---

Godfather Fight!

---

LeCun [to Hinton]: "One thing we know is that if future AI systems are
built on the same blueprint as current Auto-Regressive LLMs, they may
become highly knowledgeable but they will still be dumb. They will
still hallucinate, they will still be difficult to control, and they
will still merely regurgitate stuff they've been trained on. MORE
IMPORTANTLY, they will still be unable to reason, unable to invent new
things, or to plan actions to fulfill objectives. And unless they can
be trained from video, they still won't understand the physical
world. Future systems will *have* to use a different architecture
capable of understanding the world, capable of reasoning, and capable
of planning so as to satisfy a set of objectives and guardrails. These
objective-driven architectures will be safe and will remain under our
control because *we* set their objectives and guardrails"

---

Geoffrey Hinton: "Companies are planning to train models with 100x
more computation than today's state of the art, within 18 months. No
one knows how powerful they will be. And there's essentially no
regulation on what they'll be able to do with these models"

---

*Evil Geniuses*: "Except for Google, Facebook, and Intel, cable TV and
high-speed Internet providers, and Monsanto in much of
agribusiness.. few of the resulting corporate giants are literal
monopolies, one company absolutely dominating a given sector. Instead,
most major American industries have rapidly turned into oligopolies,
where two or three or four big companies run their show and tend not
to compete fiercely. It’s like how smart mob families peacefully
coexist.  During the 1990s and 2000s, three-quarters of all
U.S. industries became more concentrated, and their average level of
concentration doubled. Oligopoly is now the American way in mobile and
landline phone service, airlines, credit cards, meat and poultry, beer
and soft drinks, breakfast cereal, and more. In the 1990s the six
biggest banks held only one-sixth of all Americans’ financial assets,
but by 2013, five years after the crash, that share had grown to 58
percent—the year the Democratic U.S. attorney general said that while
he’d wanted to prosecute big banks for their role in the crash, he
didn’t dare because, in addition to their being too big to fail, the
legal trouble might have had 'a negative impact on the national
economy'"

---

"The Silent Killer: How Battery Degradation Can Decrease Your EV's
Resale Value.. Here are several factors that can contribute to battery
degradation.. Prolonged exposition to high temperatures.. Cold
temperatures can also affect the battery's performance.. Fast-charging
too often.. Storing the EV at a wrong state-of-charge: keeping your
car for an extended period with an empty or full battery can harm its
performance and lifespan.. The way in which a car is driven.. Hard
acceleration, high speeds, and frequent braking can all cause the
battery to degrade faster"

"@bpaassen@bildung.social

How weird it is that we expect large language models to generalize to
all kinds of tasks... When I say 'generalize' I mean that a model is
able to perform well on new, previously unseen data. In classic
machine learning, this was very strictly defined: We assumed that
training and test data were sampled from exactly the same
distribution.. In recent years, machine learning got more ambitious:
We also tried to make models generalize to test data from _other_
distributions.. In these scenarios, the theoretical guarantees for
generalization are essentially lost (except for special, nice
cases)... For some reason, we expect LLMs to generalize to entirely
new tasks that the models were not designed for. This is such a wild
and weird expectation. Why would we think that this works?..

I guess because we saw empirical examples [where] it works. But I hope
my long-winded explanation makes clear: We should be
skeptical. Expecting generalization to tasks a system was not designed
for goes far beyond the guarantees we can give.. The reasonable
generalization expectation for LLMs is that they can auto-complete
text in ways that is consistent with the training data and
superficially satisifies human raters that operate under time
pressure. That's what they are trained for. Anything else is
coincidental"

*End Times*: "Ukrainian oligarchs ruled the country unrestrained by
any other internal checks, [but] they did not become a cohesive ruling
class. Instead, they formed several factions that struggled against
each other using as weapons electoral politics, semilegal seizure of
property, and even imprisonment. When Yanukovych came to power in
2010, he jailed his rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, an oligarch popularly
known as the gas princess. The internecine conflicts between the
oligarchs made a mockery of Ukrainian democracy. No matter whom the
Ukrainians elected, the officeholders did nothing for the common
people, instead concentrating on transferring wealth and power from
the losing oligarchs...

By 2014, American 'proconsuls,' such as veteran diplomat Victoria
Nuland, had acquired a large degree of power over the Ukrainian
plutocrats. This was not cheap—Nuland boasted that the Department of
State had invested $5 billion in extending its influence over the
Ukrainian ruling class. In this, the American agents were aided by the
deep animosities pitting the oligarchs against each other and dividing
the oligarchate. Because the oligarchs were unable to agree among
themselves, they required an external manager to set a common
agenda. During the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, as we know from a
transcript of the telephone conversation between them, Nuland and
Geoffrey Pyatt, who was then the US ambassador to Ukraine, made
decisions about who was to be appointed to various state positions
(president, ministers, etc.).

Over the thirty years since Ukraine’s independence, its power
structures have developed as a three-tiered configuration: people,
oligarchs, American proconsuls. The masses of Ukrainian citizens voted
in periodic elections, but whoever they elected pursued their private
interests without any regard for the wishes of the electorate (except
where the popular wishes coincided with the desires of the
oligarchs). As a result, soon after being elected, each administration
rapidly lost public support and became mired in scandal..

The current Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s entry into
politics was a result of rivalry between two oligarchs, Poroshenko
(president of Ukraine between 2014 and 2019) and Ihor Kolomoisky (the
head of the Dnipropetrovsk oligarchic clan), who needed a candidate to
oppose Poroshenko"

most beloved American billionaire—beloved because he’s both low-key

had been right, that the privileged and powerful had launched a
one-sided war against working people and the middle class. 'There’s
class warfare, all right,' Warren Buffett said, and 'it’s my class,
the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning'—and we
'shouldn’t be.'  Forbes had published its very first list of the
richest people in 1982, estimating Buffett’s wealth then to be the
equivalent today of almost $700 million. Two decades later, when he
talked about the rich waging and winning class war, his fortune had
grown to 58 billion. His fortune is now 85 billion, 130 times what it

I cannot see why hybrids have "lower emissions", if you are using ICE
to charge the battery, then you are still emitting GHG while charging
the battery. The savings obtained from regenerative breaking is about
15%, not a game changer. Hybrids, just like battery-electric vehicles
are a waste of time and money. We can have full ZEV using an efficient
fuel that is clean, efficiently produced and stored.

"Hybrid electric vehicles are powered by an internal combustion engine
and one or more electric motors, which uses energy stored in
batteries. A hybrid electric vehicle cannot be plugged in to charge
the battery. Instead, the battery is charged through regenerative
braking and by the internal combustion engine"
