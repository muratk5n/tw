The signal being recorded at Cape Leeuwin, but not at Diego Garcia
fits that estimate, Cape Leeuwin is closer to RG's location.

The Telegraph: "Signal [from hydrophones] that could solve the mystery
of flight MH370 detected.. [R]esearchers from Cardiff analysed data
from.. underwater microphones - which picked up a six second signal
recorded around the time the plane is believed to have crashed.. a
200-ton aircraft crashing at a speed of 200 metres a second releases
the kinetic energy equivalent to a small earthquake. This would be
large enough to be recorded by hydrophones thousands of miles away.

There are two hydroacoustic stations able to detect such a signal. One
is in Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia and the second is in the
British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. They were set
up as part of a surveillance regime to oversee the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Both locations were operational around the
time MH370 is believed to have crashed into the Indian Ocean.. In
their research, the Cardiff University team has identified one
signal.. was recorded at the Cape Leeuwin station.. But this signal
was not detected at the Diego Garcia station"

Golden rule of government spending: why have one enemy when you can
have two for twice the cost? With two enemies instead of one you get
twice the profit for military contractors, twice the amount of
kickbacks gov officials receive from those companies, twice the
corruption, and twice the number of people who go through the
revolving doors. It is a "no-brainer" to use a common phrase popular
in the Clinton administration.

Host: "It is said that somewhere in the middle of the 1990s during the
Clinton Administration there was a shift in American foreign policy in
the Middle East from balancing Iran and Iraq, to double containment of
Iran and Iraq.. [Was this] policy shift towards double containment
primarily because of Israel's instigation?"

Ambassador Chas Freeman: "Yes I think that's the case. I was at the
Defense Department at the time, this policy was suddenly imposed on us
by a political appointee, Martin Indyk, actually who had been an
Israeli Citizen and was naturalized one day before taking up his
responsibilities in the National Security Council staff. It was very
hard for me or others in the region to see what benefit we would get
from a policy that is fatiguing expensive and consumes a lot of
resources.. therefore one has to assume that this was contrived for
the benefit of Israel"

Doctorow: "The IBM PC story teaches us two things: stronger antitrust
enforcement spurs innovation and opens markets for scrappy startups to
grow to big, important firms; as do weaker IP protections.

Microsoft learned the opposite: monopolies are wildly profitable;
expansive IP protects monopolies; you can violate antitrust laws so
long as you have enough monopoly profits rolling in to outspend the
government until a Republican bootlicker takes the White House
(Microsoft's antitrust ordeal ended [with Dubya])...

Microsoft's secret sauce is *impunity*. The PC companies that bundle
Windows with their hardware are held blameless for the glaring defects
in Windows. The IT managers who buy company-wide Windows licenses are
likewise insulated from the rage of the workers who have to use
Windows and other Microsoft products.

Microsoft doesn't have to care if you hate it because, for the most
part, it's not selling to you. It's selling to a few decision-makers
who can be wined and dined and flattered. And since we all have to use
its products, developers have to target its platform if they want to
sell us their software.

This rarified position has afforded Microsoft enormous freedom to roll
out harebrained 'features' that made things briefly
attractive... Microsoft recently announced a product called 'Recall'
that would record every keystroke, click and screen element, nominally
in the name of helping you figure out what you've done and either do
it again, or go back and fix it. The problem here is that anyone who
gains access to your system.. now has access to everything, on a
platter"

Dessler: "Is climate change making Florida's flooding worse?.. Warmer
air can hold more water vapor — about 7% more for every degree Celsius
increase in temperature. Consequently, the air converging into a storm
system in a warmer climate carries more water vapor. Since most of the
water vapor entering the storm’s updraft will fall out as rain,
everything else the same, more water in the air flowing into the storm
will lead to more intense rainfall. That’s it. Not terribly
complicated...

[T]he IPCC’s synthesis report concluded.. 'The frequency and intensity
of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most
land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend
analysis (high confidence), and human-caused climate change is likely
the main driver.. The projected increase in frequency and intensity of
heavy precipitation (high confidence) will increase rain-generated
local flooding'"

Doctorow: "Bill Gates didn't become one of the richest people on earth
simply by [luck]; he also owed his success to vigorous antitrust
enforcement. The IBM PC was the company's first major initiative after
it was targeted by the DOJ for a 12-year antitrust enforcement
action. IBM tapped its vast monopoly profits to fight the DOJ,
spending more on outside counsel to fight the DOJ antitrust division
than the DOJ spent on all its antitrust lawyers, every year, for 12
years.. [later] Reagan let IBM off the hook.  But the company was
still seriously scarred by its ordeal, and when the PC project kicked
off, the company kept the OS separate from the hardware (one of the
DOJ's major issues with IBM's previous behavior was its vertical
monopoly on hardware and software). IBM didn't hire Gates and Allen to
provide it with DOS because it was incapable of writing a PC operating
system: they did it to keep the DOJ from kicking down their door
again"

Tony Blink Blink 737 must have overruled it. This smells like the
doing of the surface state... Military-industrial-donor complex
control of high-levels of goverment on display. The depths are fine,
the top is corrupted, amoral, mercantile.

The Guardian: "The state department falsified a report earlier this
month to absolve Israel of responsibility for blocking humanitarian
aid flows into Gaza, overruling the advice of its own experts,
according to a former senior US official who resigned this week.

Stacy Gilbert left her post as senior civil military adviser in the
state department’s bureau of population, refugees and migration, on
Tuesday. She had been one of the department’s subject matter experts
who drafted the report mandated under national security memorandum 20
(NSM-20) and published on 10 May...

Even more controversially, the report said the state department did
not 'currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or
otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian
assistance' in Gaza. It was a high-stakes judgment because under a
clause in the Foreign Assistance Act, the US would be obliged to cut
arms sales and security assistance to any country found to have
blocked delivery of US aid"
