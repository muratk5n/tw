Politico: "Lobbyists exploit massive loophole to wine and dine
lawmakers, aides at fancy getaways.. Congressional travel rules
generally bar lobbyists from playing a significant role in organizing
or participating in trips sponsored by corporate entities. Such free
trips are limited to no more than one day, with few exceptions.

None of these restrictions, however, applies to nonprofits such as the
Congressional Institute, which regularly arranges multiday trips to
luxury hotels and resorts along the mid-Atlantic coast. Guests mingle
with private-sector institute members who pay as much as $27,500
annually for access to the invite-only retreats. And there is nothing
preventing lobbyists and industry officials from participating as
speakers or attendees at the events"

MCU did not know how to handle Thor, he was like a hot potato for
them. Thor's Asgard culture is a militocracy, the first excellent
movie shows it in its glory. The movie did great. But then mind
manipulators had to bring Thor down a notch. He was made fat, cucked,
made fool of, in multiple movies. They even had the warrior girl
pining for him lose interest and cuck others. It was a chain
cuck. Then Asgard was destroyed. Hemsworth is a good sport, he rolled
with it all, still coming out looking good, but Marv certainly
tried. If Thor was a budding businessman, an enterpreneur, even better
anti-government enterpreneur, he would be great, he would never be
cucked.

Pay attention to the end of *Foundation* Season 2. The trader, Hober
Mallow, beat Cleon. They could have used the mathematician (Seldon),
someone from the sci-religion created by the foundation.. But no,
their hero had to be the trader. Militocracy vs Plutocracy. The Anglo
subliminal messagers know which side they want you to be on.

If *Secret Wars* comic is followed Doom becomes the singular ruler of

The finishing line could be "I. Am. Businessman". 🤣

---

It is possible Disney MCU will use Doom as the symbol of a leader
inspired by a militocracy, representing the "Old World" (per origin,
VVD is even from there), and they might want to have him killed by a
character they want to build up. An anti-government businessman
perhaps? Which character would that be? Maybe they'll have a Stark
variant who is anti-government, never divested from weapon sales,
remained a regular MIC scum, he would get to kill Doom.

We need to note Napoleon was a *military* leader in the mold of other
military leaders in Europe. As Turchin says "medieval militocracies
gradually evolved into ruling classes that combined military and
administrative functions". He was not a *plutocrat*, did not
descend from a culture thinking of "bottom lines", "maximizing
profits" in that by following these precepts blindly benefits would
come to society, flowers would bloom and cows would fly. We see what
is happening to places that inherit their admin from those, basically
the Anglo-land who are currently in a process of quite implosion.

Napoleon achieved a lot in gov management, he was also extremely
supportive of the sciences and engineering.

Wiki: "The Napoleonic Code (French: Code Napoléon).. is the French
civil code established during the French Consulate in 1804 and still
in force in France.. The code, with its stress on clearly written and
accessible law, was a major milestone in the abolition of the previous
patchwork of feudal laws. Historian Robert Holtman regards it as one
of the few documents that have influenced the whole world"

Republicans pre-Trump would absolutely support that bill, after a faux

government dime - this is part and parcel of the American right (while
at the same time being anti-government -so they are taxed less-).

Bidness interests want those ppl around, not to leave the country when
they lose their job so are part of a giant unemployed pool suppressing
wages. Unemployment will come out of regular taxpayer money anyway,
not bidness, or contribute to large gov debt which they don't give a
shit abt either.

Israel constantly needs to prove to MIC that it is a "valueable thorn"

region. It didn't start out this way, but spurring weapon spending is
the only reason Israel exists right now.. The private complex has

Kuznick, *The Untold History of the US*: "Although U.S. involvement in
the First World War had been relatively brief and, by most measures,
enormously successful, the nature of the fighting, marked by trench
and chemical warfare, and the shaky postwar settlement combined to
undermine the glory of the war itself. In its aftermath, Americans
became increasingly disillusioned. A war fought to make the world safe
for democracy seemed to have failed in its purpose. Nor was there much
hope that this war would end all wars. Though some people nevertheless
clung to the belief that the United States had engaged in a great
crusade for freedom and democracy, for others the phrase rang
hollow. A postwar literature of disillusionment emerged in the works
of E. E. Cummings, John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound,
Thomas Boyd, William Faulkner, Laurence Stallings, Irwin Shaw, Ford
Madox Ford, Dalton Trumbo, and other writers as the nation learned
once again that the initial euphoria of war would be erased by the
reality of what the war actually achieved"

During covid money was printed and given to people. What happened
later? It ended up with big corp, inequality increased, meaning the
wealthy will still buy your assets, own your debt, charge you rent,
and give you crums to live by. Any new "theory" needs to put taxing
front in center, not create bizarre drama around
printing-or-not-printing, should-I-shouldnt-I-print. MMT is a waste of
time, just like battery electric cars are for climate change.

---

MMT is the tail-end, fringe part of the neolib strategy. The grand
narrative is being for "sound money" while printing it for the
rich. Media already works for them, opposition is silenced. Once in a
while though they throw the oppo a bone, via MMT this time "you could
print until you see inflation, you know", wink wink, an approach that
will never become policy, but it gives the fools hope, keeps them
occupied. That way noone talks about taxing the rich.

---

"Print until you see inflation" is not policy, it is bad analysis. MMT
is a ruse to divert attn from taxing the rich.

---

The spectre haunting the West is not communism, nor far-right
extremism (which is a symptom rather than the cause). The problem is
neolib "centrism", that opresses left-wing solutions to impose its
order, constantly creates unnecessary wars at home and
abroad. Neoliberal centrism will create econ pain and that will
eventually give rise to right-wing extremism just like when it did in
post WWI Germany.

Kursk incursion reversal is happening as fast as it advanced. That
makes sense bcz the speed of the advance had to do with the geographic
character of the place and same is true of the reversion. The areas
captured by UA were sparsely populated, not fortifed (unlike Donbas)
so Ukraine seemingly gained lots of territory, incredibly fast. Now it
is losing them as fast as they were gained. Easy come, easy go.

Fleming: "There are four.. observations, which are considered to be
proofs of General Relativity.. The first is the change in the time
rate of clocks in a gravitational field, the second is gravitational
redshift, the third is the Shapiro Delay, and the fourth is the
bending of light...

[Bending of light] has never been an issue of space contraction, but
rather the speed of light being reduced near bodies of matter. This is
the same conclusion, the speed of light changing, reached by Paul
Marmet who did an excellent job cataloging the difficulties involved
with measuring the Shapiro Delay and the bending of light... The
Shapiro Delay is due to the reduction in light velocity due to photon
deceleration/acceleration and increased London-van der Waals
torque.. Gravitational redshift is due to a decrease in energy as a
photon accelerates away from a star.. The final piece of the frame
transformation puzzle is the time rate change of clocks... this
phenomenon is not a time dilation of space, but simply a change in
clock rate due to the kinetic energy due to the velocity of a physical
clock relative to the universal rest frame"
