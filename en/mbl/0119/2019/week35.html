<hr />
<p>"[Economist] Lucas insisted that to be valid, a macroeconomic model
had to be derived from the microeconomic theory of the behaviour of
utility-maximizing consumers and profit-maximizing firms.</p>
<p>In fact, Lucas’s methodological precept—that macro level phenomena can
and in fact must be derived from micro-level foundations—had been
invalidated before he stated it. As long ago as 1953 (Gorman, 1953),
mathematical economists posed the question of whether what
microeconomic theory predicted about the behaviour of an isolated
consumer applied at the level of the market. They concluded,
reluctantly, that it did not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>market demand functions need not satisfy in any way the classical
restrictions which characterize consumer demand functions… The
importance of the above results is clear: strong restrictions are
needed in order to justify the hypothesis that a market demand
function has the characteristics of a consumer demand function. Only
in special cases can an economy be expected to act as an ‘idealized
consumer’. The utility hypothesis tells us nothing about market demand
unless it is augmented by additional requirements.’ ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What they showed was that if you took two or more consumers with
different tastes and different income sources, consuming two or more
goods whose relative consumption levels changed as incomes rose
(because some goods are luxuries and others are necessities), then the
resulting market demand curves could have almost any shape at
all. They didn’t have to slope downwards, as economics textbooks
asserted they did."</p>

<p>The comment is oft quoted, but most don't seem to know what followed

<p>This is patently false. The industrial production advantage does not
come from 'division of labor', it comes from plugging replaceable,
nearly worhless labor into an existing assembly process which is the
true advantage, the brain, the core of the production.</p>
<p>You can't take any ol' task, divide it up among people, and gain a
huge advantage. But a factory through a mechanized processes (into
which people contribute somewhat) create asymmetric results. The
assembly line <em>moves</em>, processes, ppl work on that line. </p>
<p>BTW this division of labor non-sense comes from Adam Smith, who knew
nothing, essentially repeating what al-Ghazali said a thousand years
ago who was dumber still. An "economist" needs to ask himself, 'why am
I <strong>still</strong> repeating this shit?'</p>
<p>"But the advantage of industrial production lies in division of labor"</p>
<hr />
<p>We could see more automation if it wasn't for outsourcing. From a

equation, then automation will soldier on.</p>
<p>"[Story from 2016] Greg Hayes, the CEO of United Technologies, the
parent company of the heating and air-conditioner manufacturer
Carrier, just let slip a consequence of a deal struck to keep jobs in
Indiana [..].</p>
<p>Carrier said last month that it would keep more than 1,000 jobs across
two locations in Indiana, following pressure from President-elect
Donald Trump. The decision was touted as a win for the incoming
president, who had pledged keep the jobs from moving to Mexico.</p>
<p>The result of keeping the plant in Indiana open is a $16 million
investment to drive down the cost of production, so as to reduce the
cost gap with operating in Mexico.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Automation. What does that mean? Fewer jobs,
Hayes acknowledged".</p>

<p>Why control when you can simply replace? That's why this guy keeps
faceplanting, his core assumptions are rotten.</p>
<p>Even during industrial era the machines made ppl replaceable. People
unionized to offset that but that scheme ran into trouble with
automation, outsourcing. You can battle the latter but not the former
effectively (remember Carrier?). </p>

<p>So basically constants in physics are akin to coefficients in
statistics or weights in machine learning. In stats these can reach
tens, hundreds, in Deep ML models millions. Weights are set by looking
at the data, more adjustable knobs give you more freedom, but then the
model starts losing its expressiveness. They are a fudge essentially;
A neural-net even after training, is an incomprehensible mess; it just
"works", that is feed a new data point, it can answer based on
previous points (which effect the formation of the weights), but
that's all.</p>
<p>"SU(5) is the most elegant way imaginable of unifying quarks with
leptons, and it leads to a codification of the properties of the
standard model in simple terms. Even after twenty-five years, I still
find it stunning that SU(5) doesn't work. Not that it's hard for us
theorists to get around the current failure. You can just add a few
more symmetries and particles to the theory, so that there are more
constants to adjust. With more constants to adjust, you can then
arrange for the decay of the proton to be as rare as you like. So you
can easily make the theory safe from experimental failure."</p>
<hr />
<p>"For all its usefulness, the standard model has a big problem: It has
a long list of adjustable constants. When we state the laws of the
theory, we must specify the values of these constants. As far as we
know, any values will do, because the theory is mathematically
consistent no matter which values we put in. These constants specify
the properties of the particles. Some tell us the masses of the quarks
and the leptons, while others tell us the strengths of the forces. We
have no idea why these numbers have the values they do,- we simply
determine them by experiments and then plug in the numbers. If you
think of the standard model as a calculator, then the constants will
be dials that can be set to whatever positions you like each time the
program is run.</p>
<p>There are about twenty such constants, and the fact that there are
that many freely specifiable constants in what is supposed to be a
fundamental theory is a tremendous embarrassment. Each one represents
some basic fact of which we are ignorant: namely, the physical reason
or mechanism responsible for setting the constant to its observed
value." --Smolin</p>

<p>Tooze on <a href="../../2019/08/focus-group-democracy.html">focus group democracy</a>.</p>
<p>It can't be a coincidence that of the last 4 presidents, 3 were <em>I am
CRM</em> types who need to listen to others. Because the spirit of the
times, the <em>zeitgeist</em> is such that we live in this world of
unfiltered, prevalent, avalanche style communication, people who by
default shut it off do well, and when they allow it with reasonably
efficiency this is in their positive, so they perform a badly needed
filtering at the highest office. These people keep getting the top job
(the public must be sensing this subconciously).</p>
<p>But this is only a stop-gap measure. Sadly with institutional
filtering mechanisms gutted and burdened further due to corporate
interests, not only are policy makers in general flooded with input,
they also turn around to the public, perhaps exasperated by the
situation, and seemingly ask to do their job for them. After Obama
wins the election says "you are in charge" as if the people will
magically do the job for him.</p>
<p>Of course stirring excitement, and using that as leverage on lawmakers
can be useful, but that, again, takes leadership. The root of the
problem is a giant, gaping hole in the body politick that was removed,
creating the zombie state we are in today. </p>
<p>Cross wave solution don't work; modern institutions are second wave;
concentrated, centralized, but now with the guts removed, some want to
add a "third wave paint" on it to make it shiny. Example: Obama
sitting in front of a chat room (they actually did this). This way
supposedly the President gets direct input from the public. But the
room is full of trolls, chaos, the receiving end is still the singular
executive - not a functioning solution. </p>
<p>Until there is a complete new way of governance, I'd say remaining at
second wave for modern democracy might be better, with all the colors
in the political spectrum covered and represented fully.</p>
