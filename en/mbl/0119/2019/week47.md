# Week 47


Reminder: The largest software project ever created by mankind, Linux,
was not built using object-oriented programming. This ain't the
90s. If it was, OO would be Zima.

OO is helpful in some cases, but also grossly misused. I wish it
didn't exist so ppl would not try to overengineer unreadable,
unmaintable code.

Sounds like Americans can be prowar under the right
conditions. Clinton wanted to look strong, and could sell that to
voters.

Long-term result? Not so good. Thanks to Clintonism, slave
markets are back in Libya.

"In the middle of the 1992 New Hampshire primary campaign, when
candidates were working twenty-hour days and not a minute was
unscheduled, Clinton took a break to fly back to Arkansas in order to
preside over the lethal injection of a convicted murderer named Ricky
Ray Rector.  Rector was so profoundly brain damaged from a
self-inflicted gunshot wound that it’s not clear he knew he was about
to die.  After finishing his final meal, Rector asked the guards if he
could save his dessert for later.  Rival campaigns denounced the
execution as inhumane.  Clinton ignored them, and in November he won
the general election.

The lesson was clear, and Clinton as president soon applied it to
foreign policy.  When he took office, Clinton inherited a
several-thousand-troop humanitarian mission in Somalia, first deployed
by President Bush.  Clinton didn’t simply continue the mission, he
expanded it, deploying hundreds of U.S. Special Forces to battle
Somali warlords. Clinton withdrew American forces only after nineteen
U.S.  troops were killed.  Criticism came not from liberals in his own
party, but from Republicans.

The experience was painful, but it did not halt future foreign
interventions. In 1994, Clinton dispatched Marines to Haiti in order
to topple the regime there.  The following year, Clinton sent airpower
to intervene in the Bosnian War.  He later deployed more than sixteen
thousand troops to the region.  In 1999, the United States bombed
Yugoslavia as part of the Kosovo War, and again, thousands of troops
arrived as peacekeepers in the aftermath. Clinton sent cruise missiles
into both Sudan and Afghanistan as well.

Clinton’s most militant posture was reserved for Iraq, which the
U.S. military bombed numerous times throughout his presidency.  By the
end of Clinton’s second term, the United States was bombing Iraq an
average of three times a week, at the cost of more than $1 billion a
year" -- Carlson, *Ship of Fools*

was racism, really...". He said this in a such soft understated tone
of his, it was hilarious..

New Jersey politics, it’s Norcross. The executive chairman of
insurance brokerage Conner Strong & Buckelew is regarded as one of the
most powerful people in New Jersey. In recent months, he’s faced
allegations, reported by WNYC and ProPublica, that he manipulated New
Jersey’s controversial tax-incentive program to benefit his companies
and affiliated organizations in Camden to the tune of $1.1 billion"

Besides stuff that works and known it works that is passed down, I
care nothing abt the past. All the historical buildings could
collapse, I would not bat an eye.

I dont think ppl want to live with so much of this shoddy, crypty
"history" either. Why would Egyptians build an entire new Cairo
outside the 'old' Cairo now?  Dont they loove their history? No. Noone
gives a shit. Some f--ing billionaire (of his time) built some shoddy
structure (yes the pyramids, they do suck) with slave labor, why
should anyone be forced to live with this thing, forever?

In TR case nation-state was inevitable, the collapse of the "Otto" was
a natural result of its decay. Now it's time to tune; fixing the
narrative, admitting to past mistakes, and handle problems within
borders (they *all* come from within the borders).

---

The narrative defines how the state sees its citizens and how it will
act towards them. So broad stupidity at this level needs urgent care,
sadly a chronic condition in Russia, Tiggerland and similar places.

---

Culture is not narrative. The latter can be changed, and quite
fast. 

---

What do you do when national narrative is moronic? You have to fix
it. Otherwise, anyone who is generating serious thought on national
level will dismiss it. And you don't want these people's dismissal bcz
it creates a distance between thought leaders and the state. Plus it
disturbs the newcomers into the fold from the periphery, they'll feel
like a dumbass when they arrive and find out central narrative is not
taken seriously.

(The transmission of the NN is kind of like the telephone game - but
in reverse. As the message gets to the edges it gets stronger, not
weaker. The poor sod at the end of the line believes the shit, and
believes hard. Exactly as it's written in the beginning of the
line. In the center, ppl are much more fluid with NN, especially if it
is moronic)

So be truthful. That is the best strategy.

FDR did deliver, helped a lot of people, and they voted for him until he died.

They will be whereever the f#$k you lead them to be at.

That means leadership needs to make a decision to present a
sustainable palette of political choices.  A strong left position that
alternates with right, back and forth. Until then ppl will feel pain,
project that pain in various ways and they'll keep switching every 4/8
yrs, with a Rep slant ideologically (it's their game), so everyone
will lose in the long run.

Yes. The only green solution that can solve steel. 

"It’s the most nettlesome problem in the quest to ditch fossil fuels:
how can you get thousand-degree heat used in factory furnaces without
pumping billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere?

Heat-intensive processes like steelmaking and oil refineries are the
starting point for production of everything from cars to life-saving
medicines. But fueling their ultra-high temperatures requires burning
coal, oil and natural gas. That makes industry responsible for about
20% of the carbon dioxide produced by humans and heating processes,
and a bigger emitter than all cars and aircraft combined.

Under mounting pressure from protesters and climate-conscious
investors, major industrial companies and governments are scrambling
for a solution. They’re finding the most likely alternative may be
hydrogen"

"Wild Type ..  raised $12.5 million to develop 'lab-grown' salmon, that
is fish produced by in vitro cultivation of animal cells, without the
need of wild fisheries or setting up hatcheries and farms.

In June, the company hosted a test dinner in Portland, Oregon where
they served samples of their product prepared according to a variety
of culinary traditions, including a bowl of bisque (a French soup) and
a platter of Latin American ceviche (raw fish cured in lemon and
spiced with peppers). Wild Type estimated that a single spicy salmon
roll served that night cost a whopping $ 200 to produce but they hope
to bring the price down to just $7 to $8 per pound in a few years"

It's all all about text, language; we create visual through language,
which is non-visual. Coding, as in "code" is something shorter, "code
for something else".

In unis, the culture is all about open source, and Unix. When I
started consulting, same culture. Microsoft tools, projects were seen
as bastard children, especially for server-side stuff.

But I was curious, so I joined a MS Solution Provider to see how they
work. Picked one that had received an award as top MSSP actually. At
the time they were using something called MTS, programmers drop a
'component' in a visual tool, becomes a green ball, and when the
component is called, the green ball would just start rotating. I was
like you mo..f..kas have no idea how this shit works do you?

True on the balance of manufacturing and services. There is a
hard-limit to how much of an economy can be manuf. Most countries
already produce more shit than its citizens can buy. For US case
"bring back manufacturing" is fine (to keep know-how in-house, for US
tho that know-how already existed, plus labor will not increase as a
result), but US will not be a "manufacturing economy" at the
end. Services will dominate.

before 911, after Rep win), this is TV land trying to be inclusive. He
even looks like him. CT saz the writers tried to turn him into a

Network was spun off, and renamed the American Broadcasting Company
(ABC). The FCC and DOJ also blocked these national broadcasters from
controlling local radio affiliates. The Antitrust Division also broke
up the Hollywood boss system, whereby five large studios and three
small ones controlled distribution ​of movies through ownership or
coercive deals with theaters. Taking apart this system allowed
independent filmmakers and artists to create and sell their work, and
broke the ability of movie moguls to control the careers of
actors. New Dealers sought to ensure that communications technology,
whether in film, TV, radio, or over the phone, would not be controlled
by a monopolistic or coercive business model"

"Stadler builds a hydrogen train for the first time

The Swiss railway manufacturer receives the order for the development
of a hydrogen-powered train. The order comes from California.  The new
train will provide space for 108 passengers.

The so-called "Flirt H2" is to be used in San Bernardino County in
southern California from 2024 in passenger service, as Stadler
announced on Thursday. In addition, the option exists for the delivery
of four other identical trains. An order volume was not mentioned"

Reboot Han Solo, in TV, with the actor Joe Flanigan. He'd be perfect
for the role. Funny story: in a previous work JF and Jason Momoa were
buddies, JM played the gruff warrior type, and Flanigan used to call
Momoa's character "Chewie".

Maduro is still a punk.

So the coup is more like what happened to Morsi (undemocratic leader),
faced with massive protests the bureucracy got scared, and removed
him. They should've returned to democracy afterwards, unfortunately
chose not to.

---

It is also looking like Morales might have wanted to hold on to power
a little too long, somewhat undemocratically. 

Sure it's hard especially given so many previous US interventions in
the area. Respect the process.

Lula is a good example. He governed, carried legitimacy, was wronged,
but now more popular than ever.

---

While Bolivia having half the world's lithium (used in bitch
batteries) might not have directly created this mess, it surely
contributed to some unrest. We need renewable fuels that are not based
on rare earth materials.

Morales did some good, sad to see him go this way.

UK Labor can use the chlorine chicken (from US) thing in ads - it's
very powerful. Also true. BJ knew it was catchy that's why he tried to
coopt it, but also in a way ensuring the phrase was "used up" and
can't be returned to again.  So unearth the phrase, and shove it up
his ass. B4 election ends, every1 should know US will sell UK
chlorinated chicken.
