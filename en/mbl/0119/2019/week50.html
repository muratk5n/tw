that used to be secondary, easy-to-agree-on issues, like guns, now is
not. Reagan was pro-gun control (this is the guy who made money

remember), but now no Rep will touch it. Or the issue have been mostly
decided and safely out of legislative harms way, like abortion. SCOTUS
dropped the hammer in 1973 and abortion became legal, hence this
"issue-non-issue" is now something u can safely jump up and down
about, "differentiating" youself, wout causing undue damage (surely u
can hem and haw and cut from this corner, that corner, but still, it
is mostly decided).</p>

<p>I'd look at the experience of Postmodernists - they started with the
QM Uncertainty Principle and now they are in lala land,
ultra-subjective, and worse, anti-science.</p>
<hr />
<p>I wouldn't base any philosophy on Bohr; his science is basically a
lack of one (which some modern day weirdos turned into an accepted
absurdism, extreme relativism). Philosophy and hard sciences are
intertwined, and if philosophers follow these effers they'll fall off
a cliff never to come back. Watch out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yeah - this is exactly a fitting response from the founder of Quantum
Mechanics. It "works", let's not care about the deeper issues. He
probably used that horseshoe to make exactly that point, as a
gag. Let's not forget there were huge fights about QM and its lack of
ontology back in the day, and Bohr was fighting for hearts and
minds. They won, but even tho a majority of scientists have been fed
the morphine and cannot think clearly anymore, a few brains still
continue to do so.</p>
<p>"When a friend saw a horseshoe over the door of Bohr's country cabin,
he said in mock astonishment, 'Surely you don't believe in that old
superstition!' 'No,' said Bohr, 'but they say it works even if you
don't believe in it.'"</p>
<hr />
<p>True. It can't say "how that exists", it just an algorithmic approach
that currently explains the data well. Like, by looking at the result
of division, say coming out of an "experiment", they saw (2,2) then 1,
then saw (6,3) and 2, they sort of discovered long division, bcz it
works well. It is perfectly good algorithm, and it certainly explains
a certain aspect, but are not interested in and have no idea on number
theory, sets, or functions.</p>

<p>And all this avenue of research contributed to SU(5) which led

<p>IDT the holy grail is around symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>Any effort that revolves around this concept will be ignored by
mua. If I was handling a grant awarding process, symmetry breaking
would get no money. String Theory, no money. Multiverse, no money.</p>
<p>"A common example from physics is of a pencil balanced on its
point. It is symmetric, in that while it is balanced on its point, one
direction is as good as another. But it is unstable. When the pencil
falls, as it inevitably must, it will fall randomly, in one direction
or another, breaking the symmetry. Once it has fallen, it is stable,
but it no longer manifests the symmetry—although the symmetry is still
there in the underlying laws. The laws describe only the space of what
possibly may happen; the actual world governed by those laws involves
a choice of one realization from many possibilities.  This mechanism
of spontaneous symmetry breaking can happen to the symmetries between
the particles in nature. When it occurs for the symmetries that, by
the gauge principle, give rise to the forces of nature, it leads to
the differences in their properties." -- Smolin, <em>Trouble with
Physics</em></p>

recessions. They extended the latest block as far as they could, with
laughing gas and <a href="https://youtu.be/cVsQLlk-T0s?t=86">cowbell</a>. Mooooarrr... Moooaaarrrr....</p>
<hr />
<p>"Each block in an account-chain also contains the account-chain’s
balance, meaning that one only has to store the latest block and not
one’s entire transaction history of blocks (let alone that of the
entire network). This lets users use Nano without having to download
transaction histories that are monstrous in size (e.g. Bitcoin’s
blockchain is ~250 gigabytes in size, as of writing).</p>
<p>As long as the NANO in all account-chains adds up to the NANO balance
in Nano’s genesis account-chain, which initially contained all NANO,
users can be sure that there isn’t anything suspicious going on, like
counterfeiting of NANO.</p>
<p>To make sure that this is the case, each Nano account-chain chooses a
Representative to vote on the validity of Nano transactions. Each
Representative’s voting weight is the sum of all account-chain NANO
balances delegated to it. Since blocks are incredibly small in size,
Representatives are able to confirm transactions near instantaneously.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that since there is no race between miners to
add blocks, or groups of transactions, to the blockchain in order to
win a block reward, as with networks like Bitcoin, the Nano network
uses barely any energy to stay running"</p>

<p>"Today, Google has eight products with more than a billion users
apiece. It knows what you think through its much larger “database of

two billion constantly roaming Android phones and its mobile ad app
and Google Maps subsidiaries. It knows where you go online through its
tracking businesses, and it has information about business ad
campaigns through its advertising technology subsidiaries. This
provides Google with a God’s-eye view of behavior. Married to this
surveillance power is the ability to organize the distribution of
information through YouTube, Google Maps, Google search, email, and
its own popular browser. As Schmidt put it, 'We know where you are. We

<p>IBM did all that? I thought it was bunch of rabid libertards in a

<p>"In 1980, IBM, wary of being accused of controlling the personal
computer business, signed a ​deal with Microsoft to produce an
operating system—known as DOS—for its personal computer, and
standardized its PC chips on Intel. IBM then transferred enormous
programming and technical know-how to both companies, and even
protected Intel throughout the 1980s from Japanese competition"</p>

<hr />
<p>So the aging Ginsburg is no "bulwark" against anything, against Trump,
whatever. Maybe it is good she is on her way out, no? With the right
lens lota heroes become zeros.</p>
<p>"Clinton also appointed pro-monopoly judges. When Clinton appointed
Supreme Court justices, he picked Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. Both sailed through the Senate, not because of a tradition
of bipartisanship, but because neither worried powerful business
interests. Both were adherents of the same basic monopoly-friendly
philosophy promoted by the Chicago School. And once on the bench, in
2004, both signed one of the most pro-monopoly opinions in the ​history
of the court, one authored by Antonin Scalia. “The mere possession of
monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is
not only not unlawful,” said the court, “it is an important element of
the free-market system"  -- Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>
<hr />
<p>"As a candidate, Clinton’s Democratic platform called for a
'Revolution of 1992', capturing the anger of the moment. But the
platform was written by Al From, and for the first time since 1880
there was no mention of antitrust or corporate power, despite a decade
with the worst financial manipulation America had seen since the
1920s. This revolution would be against government, in government,
around government.</p>
<p>When Clinton took office, the Democrats finally had a majority in the
House, a majority in the Senate, and the presidency. Clinton not only
entrenched Reagan’s antitrust principles into the DOJ by making them
bipartisan, but expanded the Reagan revolution more broadly. With the
end of the Cold War, Clinton took neoliberalism global"  -- Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>

compelling alternative to Reaganism, and as a means of addressing
international financial problems. Thurow had drawn from Galbraith, who
in turn had drawn directly from such Bull Moose thinkers as Walter
Lippmann.</p>
<p>Like Teddy Roosevelt and Galbraith, Thurow preached the abolition of
the antitrust laws. All used the same excuse for doing so. “In markets
where international trade exists or could exist, national antitrust
laws no longer make sense,” wrote Thurow. This was a direct echo of
TR’s statement, in accepting the Bull Moose nomination in 1912, that
if we “do not allow cooperation, we shall be defeated in the world’s
markets.” As Rothenberg pointed out, Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, and Paul
Tsongas made the same argument, all proposing to relax antitrust and

<p>"Business goliaths restructured in the 1980s to take advantage of this
new merger wave. The leader was a young and aggressive new CEO at one
of the oldest and biggest conglomerates in America, General Electric,
the corporation that had financed much of Bork’s research. ​Jack Welch
was trained as an engineer, and had made it to the top at GE by
selling a new type of plastic. Walter Wriston was on the board of GE,
and had helped Welch become CEO.48 Welch made his mark as CEO not by
engineering products, but by financial engineering" -- Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>

<p>Earth is very rare... From the large moon whose creation caused to the
tilt we needed to the moon itself which due to its size creates tides
that allowed life to flourish (in tidal pools) it all sums up to a
uniqueness that is hard to come by..</p>
<p>All this contributes to a feeling of weirdness for us. In all our
explorations, whereever we went we found more ppl, more life. In space
we keep looking and looking there is noone else.</p>

<p>"The reason engineers continue to rely on [physical models] is because
today, in 2016, we still do not have the computers or the science to
do all the things that physical models can do. …</p>
<p>Hydraulic engineering gets into some of the most complicated math
there is. Allegedly when Albert Einstein’s son Hans said he wanted to
study how sediment moves underwater, Einstein asked him why he wanted
to work on something so complicated"</p>
