# Week 40

Lean theorem prover - I hear good things [about
it](https://leanprover.github.io/about), more
[here](https://jiggerwit.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/a-review-of-the-lean-theorem-prover/)

Tom Hales presentation on it was great. Codifying all math axioms,
theorems in software.

Last thing I'd read on this topic was [this](https://www.wired.com/2015/05/will-computers-redefine-roots-math/).

Seriously - is this your defense. That break-up will bother ad people? 

"But ad people were happy, they would learn Facebook, Google, and now
they have to learn ad tools for FB1, FB2, Google 1, Google 2.. this is
crazy!"

That's not a problem. USG can mandate existing / new users will be
shared among the two companies for a X years after
break-up. Intra-company messaging between user 1 messaging from
company A to user 2 on company B can be handled. They can build a
bridge for that - easy, bunch of IT work - this is what these people
do, shuffling shit around.

"How can you break up a social network? Dividing money is easy, but
what about users? Half my friends will be here, half over there.. how
does that work?"

This is one huge spaghetti of conclusions, spurious correlation, weird
cause-effect.

First of all if we abolish
[grades](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2011/02/grading.html),
opt for self-directed courses, all students will get an A from the
course (meaning they will pass, they will remain in the subject until
they pass).

Now, in the existing crap system, why do average students remember
more than good students? We can speculate, if these so-called average
students remember more, it probably means they were more interested in
the course.

But that, in a way, was their undoing. They became curious about
stuff, got off track somewhat, maybe, became annoyed when they built
gaps in their knowledge, and did poorly in the course as a result. But
later, they remembered more. This is not about "breaking eggs" as is
suggested by the article, but about the poorness of content (which
revolves around a "teacher" "teaching" to the whole class, in sync),
where kids cannot freely consult other sources without losing time on
the freight train that is the course.

"All other factors being equal, when you test how well students have
mastered course material some months or even years after the course
has ended, students who do well in courses, getting mostly A’s on
assignments and exams, tend to perform worse than students who
struggled and got more mediocre grades at the time.

Yes, you read that correctly, the struggling students tend to do
better than the seemingly “good” students, when you see how much they
remember, and how well they can perform, months or even years later"

I'd rather approximate the function analytically, and be able to
calculate a value at *any* point. Then you don't need to compute in a
*finer* grid for better results. Derivatives on this analytic function
can be computed through `autograd`.

Preparing function values at grid points is so 2010.

"China’s anti-ship hypersonic missiles have a more significant
purpose. China regards the seas to its east as essential to its
national security, and the presence of the U.S. Navy in those waters
is a threat the Chinese can’t ignore. But China can’t drive the
U.S. farther east with conventional weapons, since U.S. defensive
systems would be able to withstand any Chinese attack and a
U.S. retaliation would be harsh. But the mere existence of hypersonic
weapons that U.S. defenses could not block would force the fleet to go
farther east and out of range.

But the Chinese missiles have a crucial weakness. That weakness is
knowing the rough location of the targeted vessel. Even if the missile
had a terminal guidance system and could maneuver at extremely high
speeds and temperatures, it would need detailed information on
location. Conventional Chinese reconnaissance aircraft would have
difficulty surviving inside the U.S. air defense envelope. Unmanned
aerial vehicles would also have difficulty surviving and would be
subject to electronic warfare interfering with its transmissions to
the missile’s base or spoofing its signal. In such an attack, the
probability of success must be much higher than UAVs can likely
provide.

The attacker, therefore, must rely on satellite surveillance..."

"It seems likely that it was soon after the takeover of Spain that the
pagan Vandals converted to Christianity. It also seems likely that the
missionaries who converted them were Goths. Arian [different from
Aryan] Christians and proud of it ...

Roman Catholicism was certainly popular among the Roman governing
classes in the West, but it wasn't so obviously the Christianity of
choice of ordinary people. Even Ambrose, the charismatic bishop of
Milan, complained of the decline in people coming to take communion
there. He said the same thing was happening in the East, but that's
not too surprising given the fact that Catholicism was imposed from
above on an Arian  population there...

There may well have been a whiff of popular discontent in people's
reluctance to attend Catholic churches, possibly connected with the
incorporation of Jesus into the imperial power structure. The Catholic
Church emphasized not his human incarnation but his transcendent
magisterial authority, his right to judge the living and the dead and
to determine their fate for all eternity. Basically, the terrible
power of Roman authority was presented as being derived from the even
more terrible power of Jesus, a looming supreme God painted on the
apse ceiling over the altar where his blood was to be drunk and his
body eaten.

The Arian Church seems to have been much more popular. Their Jesus was
not the same as the all-powerful God; he was rather less threatening,
and wasn't identified with the state" -- *Terry Jones' Barbarians*

German public opinion was pro-immigration before Syrian refugees, now
against it. Public op is fickle, this should not be a surprise because

pols should act for that long-term too. It makes sense electorally to
prepare for that distant vote. If DE politician went with public op on

Unfortunately much of "futurism" is co-opted by rabid free-marketers -
libertards, centrists, goldcucks, even right-wingers. Toffler's
futurism was about outlining the evolution of tech and pointing to
downsides of that tech and the need for a new social contract. Most of
that analysis fell on deaf ears. It feels odd telling Americans about
this stuff - Toff is not my jigger. He is yours.

---

Maybe this is why caps always talk abt these "futuristic" solutions
for every problem, like Dalio, the "spaz billionaire", says "education
will fix poverty".

Education is completely about the future. It won't create any
"returns" before 10, 20 years.

Poverty, lack of healthcare is in the now. You have to focus on the
now for these kinds of problems.

Much of capitalism is abt future; credit is all abt future. He was
negative, but came back from it, probably wout much loss in quality of
life.

Haha.. While near bankruptcy Trump sees homeless guy tells daughter

Boulders? 

Sign of late-stage capitalism must be homelessness among
billionaires. And boulders on sidewalks.

"Some neighbors pooled together $2000 to dump 24 boulders into the
sidewalk as a form of “anti-homeless decoration”... That’s money they
could used to help people. Instead they tried to hide problems the
city’s problems from just their block.  It didn’t even work
though. The rocks placement is barbaric and make walking more
difficult for everyone"

Royalty watching (or the modern version celeb watching) is solidly

builds on similar kind of fascination. Some repugnant shit.

Geiseric, the Vandal ruler who sacked Rome was Arian Christian. In
this sect Jesus is not God, but a human, a messenger. Catholic Rome
turned Jesus into God, so the emperor could associate himself with
him, and become God. Vandals (whose name is forever associated with
untoward acts to cities due to Roman propaganda) were chased away by
the empire, but they survived, flourished in Carthege, and later
mobilized and sacked Rome. This is another instance where the battle
between Christianity and faux Christianity played a role, contributing
to the collapse of a mafia-state.
