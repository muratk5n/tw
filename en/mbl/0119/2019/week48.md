# Week 48

I. Morris says ppl actually willingly switched to agro; and there was
a certain ease abt the "security" of food retrival IMO, tho quality is
of course is questionable. I agree in the long term it was a lose-lose
situation.

"Jared Diamond’s 1999 essay about the transition to agriculture is
called, ominously, “The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human
Race.” More recently, historian Yuval Noah Harari goes so far as to
call the agricultural revolution “history’s biggest fraud.” In his
2015 bestseller, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, he writes,
“The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food
at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate
into a better diet or more leisure.” Harari agrees that all that extra
food merely fueled “population explosions and pampered elites” and
that farmers typically worked longer and harder than foragers for an
inferior diet. Forced into settled communities as a last resort,
agriculturalists faced drastic increases in social inequality, much
more violence in the form of organized conflict, and self-appointed
elites who used monotheistic religion to lock in their power"

From the prestigious journal *Applied Energy* - says batteries will
never fall below $124/kwh making them useless for competing against
fossil. Making huge waves today.

"Learning only buys you so much: Practical limits on battery price reduction ... 

Conventional learning curves for manufacturing costs, used in many
battery projections, unrealistically predict battery prices will fall
below $100/kWh by 2030, pushing EVs to hit price parity with internal
combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in the absence of
incentives. However, in reality, essential materials jcosts set
practical lower bounds on battery prices.

Our 2-stage learning curve model projects the active material costs
and NMC-based Lithium-ion battery pack price with mineral and material
costs as the respective price floors. The improved model predicts
nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery prices will fall only to about
$124/kWh by 2030 – much cheaper than today, but still too expensive to
truly compete with ICEVs, due primarily to the high prices of cobalt,
nickel, and lithium"

"[Werner Herzog] was born during World War II, and when only a couple

"[Morales] wrote a new constitution that gave him greater
powers... And he was unwilling to acknowledge the existence of a
legitimate opposition, perpetually vilifying his adversaries as
traitors.In recent years, as Morales’s support among the Bolivian
people began to slip, his attacks on democracy became more
blatant. [H]e [.. unconstitutionally .. ] ran for a fourth term as
president. And when he seemed to fall short of the necessary majority
to win election in the first round, he engaged in what the
Organization of American States decried as a “clear manipulation” of
the vote. Among other measures, he tampered with the electronic tally
and halted the count. His attempt to steal the election cost Morales
the support of a large number of Bolivians, including many trade
unionists, indigenous people, and longtime members of his own
political party. As protesters took to the street to demand his
resignation, and police forces across the country refused to use force
to quash dissent, Morales was forced into exile in Mexico"

Very important point. Wout "free stuff" (Linux) libertard goldcucks
would not have the "commercial stuff" (Android phones). iPhones have
similar levels of free, publicly-funded research in them. 

---

So bug fixes, new features, for many projects were flying through the
Internet over this mechanism. Apache (>50% of web servers today),
Linux (the core of all Android phones), u name it.

Text based. Code. Not rotating balls. That's how it works.

A lot of open source in the early days worked through "patch
files". Say I have a file (it could be a piece of code), `originalfile`

```python
These are a few words.
One word is worth thousand pictures
```

And I made changes to the first line inside file `updatedfile` (this
an example, usually the change would be in the same file, but maybe in
a different directory)

```python
These still are just a few words.
One word is worth thousand pictures
```

Now I can use a tool called `diff` to find the differences, and put
those differences in a "patch file",

```python
! diff /tmp/originalfile /tmp/updatedfile > /tmp/patchfile.patch

! cat /tmp/patchfile.patch
```

This is the patch,

```text
2c2
< These are a few words.
---
> These still are just a few words.
```

Now I can copy and paste this into an email, to a forum, anyone can
take it, and "apply the patch" to their code base, fast forwarding
their `originalfile` to my changed version `updatedfile`,

```python
! patch /tmp/originalfile -i /tmp/patchfile.patch -o /tmp/updatedfile2
```

```text
patching file /tmp/updatedfile2 (read from /tmp/originalfile)
```

And recreate the version that I have, 

```python
! cat /tmp/updatedfile2
```

```text
These still are just a few words.
One word is worth thousand pictures
```

Part of news is sensationalism, sure. Talking abt things that stand
out, are interesting. Like instead of "dog bites man", it is "man

either. There is a certain level of shock, a certain standard we
expect of the Florida man. Anything below that is unnewsworthy.

Why is there no climate action?

Because governments, media and Big Business are all part of the same
mutually supportive system, and mainstream media refuse to say that
the fossil fuel industry and governments that support it are

And these ppl somehow ended up being corp sluts.

"Though mainstream economists didn’t care about Hayek’s views, he and
Simons began collaborating on the possibility of putting together the
Free Market Study. Both men were fiercely anticorporate, seeing
private corporate power as an equally dangerous form of central
planning" -- Stoller, *Goliath*

Stoller, *Goliath*

"Still, as exciting as the project might be in 1946, returning to a
pre–New Deal world seemed impossible. To reconstruct the system over
which Andrew Mellon reigned required an architecture with three
components.

The first component was the ability to rule an entire market through a
specific corporate monopoly, or shared control of a market through a
small set of corporations (which was known as an oligopoly rather than
a monopoly). Each monopolistic company would be a mini-government,
governing the prices, quality, labor, and supply chain of an
industrial product or service, such as aluminum, oil, steel, ships,
and magnesium. But during the New Deal, robust antitrust enforcement
kept concentration and monopolization at bay.

Each company had in turn been controlled by one of a small number of
oligarchs or banks, such as the House of Morgan, DuPont, Rockefeller,
or Mellon himself. This was done through the second component, the
connective power that turned each monopoly into a networked whole,
with mechanisms to discipline wayward corporate structures. This was
Wall Street, with tools such as holding companies, interlocking
directorates, stock watering, debt issuance, and various forms of
financial instruments. Wall Street, however, was deeply constrained by
financial rules.

The third piece was the rhetorical machinery, a set of intellectual
concepts and political institutions that would protect financial
empires from democratic influence. Money would be necessary, money to
develop and sell this ideology, not only to fund new academic
departments, but to buy politicians and lawyers, to influence voters
and newspapers, to set up institutions to persuade judges and
professors. Even more critical was rhetoric to explain the world in
ways that would organize citizens to seek not freedom from capital,
but freedom ​for capital. But this was difficult to imagine, as New
Dealers seemed to rule the centers of cultural capital, the newspapers
and academic institutions.

It was their task to imagine it nonetheless. They saw themselves as up
against the world, and they were going to conquer it. The Free Market
Study, and then the Antitrust Project, would serve as the intellectual
testing ground for the set of ideas that would eventually burst out of
the academy and generate a political and financial revolution"
