SB is a total 3W company; stores are geared for knowledge workers.

I been to so many Sbucks stores in so many different countries that if
there was an award for this sort of thing, I am sure I'd win it. I
seek them out whereever I go too.. I could be in Philippenes Cebu City
and I'll find the SB there.

National Dem polling might be misleading, regional ones, since cands
probably put more energy there, could be more indicative. Iowa, New
Hamp, South Car, Cali are 5, 7, 22, 1 ahead for Biden (ahead of the
next most pop cand). So SC needs some attention.. Whoever is after the
nom, needs to clean his clock in South Carolina.

Good profiling trick: look at intense disagg, conflict - usually the
two sides of the conf have the same type. Like Varoufuckis vs
Schauble, both are Mellow Meadow. Who gets the most brutal digs into
Trump?  Colbert. Etc..

Whatever we might know of other types, we only truly now our own
kind.

And when someone like us does something wrong, we insinctively know
where it comes from, so the attacks can be more pointed.

It's all bunk. Follow this crap at your own expense. The FAQ (one of
the links Woit shared) says 'the experiments are, unfortunately, not
likely to offer many insight or opportunities for surprise; the result
can be predicted with very high confidence long in advance. QD is
roughly about demonstrating the internal (theoretical) compatibility
of unitary quantum dynamics with the appearance of classicality (and,
in particular, wavefunction collapse)'.

"Philip Ball at Quanta has a nice article on “Quantum Darwinism” and
experiments designed to exhibit actual toy examples of the idea in
action (I don’t think “testing” the idea is quite the right language
in this context)"

The TR banker guy is back, released from US, some say had ties to
Iranian sanction-violating oil-gold trade. Most think he was arrested
as tit-for-tat by US for TR distancing itself from US.

But overt slaps like F-35 prog removal already do that for DJT. This

doesnt seem to want an all-out punishment, so fine.

Steve Jobs was not a Syrian immigrant; he was adopted and raised by
Americans Paul and Clara Jobs. His father, the Syrian immigrant, gave
up Steve for an adoption at a young age.

Also his bio father has a PhD.

(I am not saying non-PhD ppl are not worthy but the original commenter
might want to pick another example for his "signaling").

is trying to say, implying Steve Jobs].. so we should have open

SM will travel back in time, go to a different universe, travel

Aluminum is a light metal; so I bet these tablets weight little. Best
energy bang for your buck.

Sweet. I knew about aluminum being used in H2 generation, it's a cheap
material, not rare-earth, using it as tablets for instant energy
generation is excellent idea.

Is the licensing exclusive? Any avenues for public, commercial use?

"“This is on-demand hydrogen production [without catalyst ..]. Imagine
a squad of future Soldiers on a long range patrol far from base with
dead batteries and a desperate need to fire up their radio. One of the
Soldiers reaches for a metal tablet and drops it into a container and
adds water or some fluid that contains water such as urine,
immediately the tablet dissolves and hydrogen is released into a fuel
cell, providing instant power for the radio.”  "

The lithium ion battery is made up by numerous cells. When a cell in

Can you determine longitude with a sextant? Yes. Based on moon-sun
angles, and mapping them to known GMT angle / times, figure out time
at Greenwich, u know your own time (at the very least noon), based on

But, GMT-synced clocks are still better.
