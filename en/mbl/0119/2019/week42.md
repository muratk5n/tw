Ironically their presence is also killing democracy outside China,
on stateside, at their home turf.

Plus the reason they were in China to begin with was precisely because
of the non-presence of democracy, making use of that cheap slave labor
that could only be controlled through an autocratic state.

More codes useful for presidential campaigns - the culture code for
hospital is PROCESSING PLANT - so campaigns which paint someone else's
health plan more with bad experiences with hospitals can benefit. U
get shoved in there, being processed.. these networks etc.. that can
work.

Code 4 presidency - MOSES. POTUS is someone who leads ppl to the
promised land. A good candidate needs to be seen as a man on a
mission, moving somewhere and asking others to follow him.

Code US gives itself - HOPE. That's why 1992 Clinton campaign was
brilliant - "I still believe in a place called 'hope'". This word
might have been polluted bcz of Bama who also used it and failed at
delivering it recently (as did Clinton before), but there might be
other ways to reference it.

Message discipline - I talked abt it
[here](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2018/05/q-65.html)
briefly; the Clinton 92 campaign, also W campaign, was one of the best
users of this. From George Stephapapopolapopolaolpololoolous in *All
too Human*,

>But for all of our high-tech toys, the most useful item in the War
Room [during the '92 campaign] was a low-tech template — a
hand-lettered white board that James [Carville] stuck on a pillar in
the middle of the room. It said:

>*Change vs. More of the Same*

>*The economy, stupid*

>*Don't forget health care*

>I thought of it as a campaign haiku — an entire election manifesto
condensed to nineteen syllables. James drilled it into our heads, and
every speech, every event, every attack, and every response had to
reflect one of these three commandments.

Why did Hillary lose? She looks like a petite, small lady; Americans
(in fact many other voters) like tall-ish, lanky politicians -
i.e. Protestan looking. Stocky, butt-close-to-the-ground peasant types
don't do so good. You have to look nomadic. Even subconciously ppl
seek that.

In terms of general-demenaor, can't be too stiff, too brittle... U
need to come across like some stuff can just slide off you, in a
backslapping, guys-guy kinda way. You have to be somewhat of an oaf,
bonehead - but not much. This is true even for women, maybe for them
we can call it tomboy-ishness. If we are to compare women, Warren does
this better than Hillary. The folksy can-opening, drinking video in
the beginning of campaign is a guys-gal move. Even for women voter
that is more preferable than brittle, static, Catholic-like, "the
punisher" *hanımağa*.

It makes sense how a little touch of oaf is attractive for the
die-hard followers, volunteers as well; they need to be comfortable
their head won't get bit off at the slightest wrong move. So a little
oaf makes better followers.

Elected Presidents are mostly like this; Trump is an oaf. Even Obama
was somewhat of an oaf.  Dubya 10-out-10 - in his case it bordered on
dumbass, but it didn't matter. People still preferred him over Gore -
the textbook definition of stiff. One *Silicon Valley* episode had the
best joke on him, one character said Gore came across like a
"narcoleptic plantation owner".

transition to post-empire, food-style-fashion economy (as in Italy)
should have happened already, wholesale, but partly the country is

"U.S. to deploy large number of forces to Saudi Arabia" - Reuters

---

No you cannot understand this you second, third generation "foreign"
dumbass who thinks they are still "Polish", or "Italian" even tho they
are 100% American. Your thing has to do with latching onto a
minority-as-ornament feeling, post Michael Jackson "represent"
culture, that is as farsical as your assumed foreign identity. Go
gently fuck yourself. The kids table is over there.

---

Believe me the last thing the world needs is these dimwits "coming
back to the world scene" in the traditional sense.

---

Kemal tried to change this feeling, so ppl identified with the most
recent state, its advance, not the loss of petty old rulers. Sadly
after the TR fascist coup of 1980, combined with the "Green Belt"
strategy of US all that shit came back. Most of these Pol Pot type
punks you see walking around today are the products of that era.

---

Tigger nationalism, much like mainland Chink nationalism, rests on a
general feeling of "coming back to the world scene". The "back" part
is due to the agrarian genocidal past related to mafia-king-sultan who
needs to project fear to keep his farm-land united, which does not
exist anymore due to [insert event here]. Opium War, World War 1,
whatever. These ppl held on and nursed their pain throughout the
years, all the way up to now, whether justified or not. This pain
somehow flied under the radar, mostly unseen. The loss is actually 
understandable, in case of Ottomans, the naval empires putting and end
to their dominance, or from another angle, second wave beating first
wave, just like the agrarian South in US losing to industrial
North. But the nurse-pain-come-back-in-1st-wave-terms feeling lingers,
creating unnecessary tension.

"Cost of Green Hydrogen in the Gulf

To produce 1 kg of hydrogen requires 50kWh of electricity and since solar energy could cost 3 $ct/kWh in the Gulf, the energy cost to produce hydrogen is 1.5 $/kg. An electrolyser costs approximately $600,000 per MW but is projected to cost $400,000 in a few years from now. Assuming 8,000 annual full load hours, a 1MW electrolyser coupled to a solar system would produce 160,000 kg of H2 per year. Assuming a 10-year life and linear depreciation, this would add 0.25 $/kg to the cost of the hydrogen. The overall cost of green hydrogen made from sunshine and water in the Gulf could be as low as 1.75 $/kg"
