<h1>Week 47</h1>
<p>Reminder: The largest software project ever created by mankind, Linux,
was not built using object-oriented programming. This ain't the
90s. If it was, OO would be Zima.</p>
<p>OO is helpful in some cases, but also grossly misused. I wish it

<p>Sounds like Americans can be prowar under the right
conditions. Clinton wanted to look strong, and could sell that to
voters.</p>
<p>Long-term result? Not so good. Thanks to Clintonism, slave
markets are back in Libya.</p>
<p>"In the middle of the 1992 New Hampshire primary campaign, when
candidates were working twenty-hour days and not a minute was
unscheduled, Clinton took a break to fly back to Arkansas in order to
preside over the lethal injection of a convicted murderer named Ricky
Ray Rector.  Rector was so profoundly brain damaged from a
self-inflicted gunshot wound that it’s not clear he knew he was about
to die.  After finishing his final meal, Rector asked the guards if he
could save his dessert for later.  Rival campaigns denounced the
execution as inhumane.  Clinton ignored them, and in November he won
the general election.</p>
<p>The lesson was clear, and Clinton as president soon applied it to
foreign policy.  When he took office, Clinton inherited a
several-thousand-troop humanitarian mission in Somalia, first deployed
by President Bush.  Clinton didn’t simply continue the mission, he
expanded it, deploying hundreds of U.S. Special Forces to battle
Somali warlords. Clinton withdrew American forces only after nineteen
U.S.  troops were killed.  Criticism came not from liberals in his own
party, but from Republicans.</p>
<p>The experience was painful, but it did not halt future foreign
interventions. In 1994, Clinton dispatched Marines to Haiti in order
to topple the regime there.  The following year, Clinton sent airpower
to intervene in the Bosnian War.  He later deployed more than sixteen
thousand troops to the region.  In 1999, the United States bombed
Yugoslavia as part of the Kosovo War, and again, thousands of troops
arrived as peacekeepers in the aftermath. Clinton sent cruise missiles
into both Sudan and Afghanistan as well.</p>
<p>Clinton’s most militant posture was reserved for Iraq, which the
U.S. military bombed numerous times throughout his presidency.  By the
end of Clinton’s second term, the United States was bombing Iraq an
average of three times a week, at the cost of more than $1 billion a
year" -- Carlson, <em>Ship of Fools</em> </p>

"history" either. Why would Egyptians build an entire new Cairo

<p>In TR case nation-state was inevitable, the collapse of the "Otto" was
a natural result of its decay. Now it's time to tune; fixing the
narrative, admitting to past mistakes, and handle problems within
borders (they <em>all</em> come from within the borders).</p>
<hr />
<p>The narrative defines how the state sees its citizens and how it will
act towards them. So broad stupidity at this level needs urgent care,
sadly a chronic condition in Russia, Tiggerland and similar places.</p>
<hr />
<p>Culture is not narrative. The latter can be changed, and quite
fast. </p>
<hr />
<p>What do you do when national narrative is moronic? You have to fix
it. Otherwise, anyone who is generating serious thought on national
level will dismiss it. And you don't want these people's dismissal bcz
it creates a distance between thought leaders and the state. Plus it
disturbs the newcomers into the fold from the periphery, they'll feel
like a dumbass when they arrive and find out central narrative is not
taken seriously.</p>
<p>(The transmission of the NN is kind of like the telephone game - but

is moronic)</p>

how can you get thousand-degree heat used in factory furnaces without

<p>Heat-intensive processes like steelmaking and oil refineries are the
starting point for production of everything from cars to life-saving
medicines. But fueling their ultra-high temperatures requires burning
coal, oil and natural gas. That makes industry responsible for about
20% of the carbon dioxide produced by humans and heating processes,
and a bigger emitter than all cars and aircraft combined.</p>
<p>Under mounting pressure from protesters and climate-conscious
investors, major industrial companies and governments are scrambling
for a solution. They’re finding the most likely alternative may be
hydrogen"</p>

<p>True on the balance of manufacturing and services. There is a

"bring back manufacturing" is fine (to keep know-how in-house, for US
tho that know-how already existed, plus labor will not increase as a
result), but US will not be a "manufacturing economy" at the

<p>TV show <em>Star Trek Enterprise</em> (not TNG, not DS9, not Voyager, the other
one, with Bakula) aired on Sep 2001, two weeks after 9/11. The event
probably cut the legs from under the show little bit. And I bet
C. Trinnier was cast to be a stand-in for W (casting decision made
before 911, after Rep win), this is TV land trying to be inclusive. He
even looks like him. CT saz the writers tried to turn him into a
hayhead but he resisted. Anyway just watched STE last show, and
Trinnier's character dies at the end. So they killed Dubya. By season
5 it would be 2006, and the Iraq War would be grating on everyone.</p>

<p>Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>
<p>"In the 1940s, the FCC and the Department of Justice’s Antitrust
Division split up RCA, which owned two national broadcasters, the
National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Blue Network. The Blue
Network was spun off, and renamed the American Broadcasting Company
(ABC). The FCC and DOJ also blocked these national broadcasters from
controlling local radio affiliates. The Antitrust Division also broke
up the Hollywood boss system, whereby five large studios and three
small ones controlled distribution ​of movies through ownership or
coercive deals with theaters. Taking apart this system allowed
independent filmmakers and artists to create and sell their work, and
broke the ability of movie moguls to control the careers of
actors. New Dealers sought to ensure that communications technology,
whether in film, TV, radio, or over the phone, would not be controlled
by a monopolistic or coercive business model"</p>

<p>So the coup is more like what happened to Morsi (undemocratic leader),
faced with massive protests the bureucracy got scared, and removed
him. They should've returned to democracy afterwards, unfortunately
chose not to.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is also looking like Morales might have wanted to hold on to power
a little too long, somewhat undemocratically. </p>
<p>Sure it's hard especially given so many previous US interventions in
the area. Respect the process.</p>
<p>Lula is a good example. He governed, carried legitimacy, was wronged,
