We rightfully nag on Chris Matthews now. But for as long as I've seen
that guy on TV, he's regularly said "these people are exaactly the
same!" in that punishing tone of his, meaning Democrats and
Republicans during 90s and later. In fact I have a memory reel in my
head passing thru airports, cafes, restaurants, with TV in the
background, and CM on TV yelling "theeese peeople aaaare exaaactly the
saaame!".

MSM types aren't all idiots. Some if not most see what's going on.

"Only a bunch of PhD Economists could have managed to take a bad, but
contained problem (aka, the Great Financial Crisis) and made it
worse*.  Unfortunately, this was completely predictable.

In fact, it was predicted by a world famous PhD macroeconomist, Anna
Schwartz.  In a series of interviews in October 2008 (see here and
here), she openly criticized PhD Economists for using monetary
accommodation and fiscal stimulus to address what was an opacity
problem.

The Fed has gone about as if the problem is a shortage of
liquidity. That is not the basic problem. The basic problem for the
markets is that [uncertainty] that the balance sheets of financial
firms are credible.”  She made the point of saying how hard it would
be to stop these macroeconomists from supporting and pursing endless
rounds of monetary accommodation and fiscal stimulus rather than admit
their theories were wrong and they had no idea what they were doing.

If I regret one thing, it’s that Milton Friedman isn’t alive to see
what’s happening today. It’s like the only lesson the Federal Reserve
took from the Great Depression was to flood the market with
liquidity. Well, it isn’t working. Professor Friedman would have
enough stature to get them to listen"

Actually Trump did a great favor to all; by adapting all hot button
issues of Reps, he cheapened them, made a mockery of them, debased
them. Guns, abortion, even religion.. he showed it was _that_ easy and
cheap to become a Republican, just talk bunch of nonsense abt all
these hot button issues and you were done. Maybe Reps will shrug this
monkey shit as a result.

The original sin belongs to corporate Dems of course, forcing Reps to
be this way.

Interesting. Looking at the [Politico
poll](https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/) (taken in
early primary states, which includes just voters who live in Iowa, New
Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada). Biden, Bernie, Warren votes are
[here](https://twitter.com/muratk3n/status/1168259420838649864).  I
looked at the time series correlation (who takes from who), I see

```python
import scipy.stats
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def p_corr(df1, df2):
    corr = df1.corr(df2)
    N = np.sum(df1.notnull())
    t = corr*np.sqrt((N-2)/(1-corr**2))
    p = 1-scipy.stats.t.cdf(abs(t),N-2)  # one-tailed
    return corr, t, p

df = pd.read_csv('politico08.csv')
```

```python
c,tval, pval = p_corr(df['JB'], df['BS'])
print ('jb bs',c, pval)
c,tval, pval = p_corr(df['JB'], df['EW'])
print ('jb ew',c, pval)
c,tval, pval = p_corr(df['BS'], df['EW'])
print ('bs ew',c, pval)
```

```text
jb bs -0.4385177884643625 0.005344173819257447
jb ew 0.08736843848625221 0.31438189311479825
bs ew -0.34634282407173045 0.024164559243460393
```

There is a medium level negative correlation between Biden and Bernie,
it is statistically significant. Negative correlation means one's gain
is loss for the other, vica versa. The correlation range is betwen -1
and +1, with -1 being highest negative correlation.

There is _no_ corr between Biden and Warren which is interesting. She
is not taking from Biden. There is medium and negative correlation
between Bernie and Warren. Bernie takes from Biden, Warren from
Bernie, but not from Biden.

If Biden falls in a big way, Bernie would heap much of the gain.

\o/ UK Labor is looking at UBI. 

"But this may be just the start. The leadership is also studying an
array of even more radical ideas, including a four-day week, pay caps
on executives, an end to City bonuses, a universal basic income, a
“right to buy” for private tenants and a shake-up in the way that land
is taxed to penalise wealthy landlords."

"At the heart of [Labour plans] is one
word: redistribution. Redistribution of income, assets, ownership and
power. The mission is to shift power from capital to labour, wresting
control from shareholders, landlords and other vested interests and
putting it in the hands of workers, consumers and tenants. 'We have to
rewrite the rules of our economy,” says Mr McDonnell. 'Change is
coming.'

David Willetts, a former Conservative cabinet minister who now chairs
the Resolution Foundation think-tank, says Brexit has made it harder
to paint Labour’s plans as risky. 'Brexit is so radical and such a
massive gamble, breaking a 40-year trading arrangement, that it’s hard
for Tories to say to people ''don’t gamble on Labour''' says Lord
Willetts. 'They just think: who’s the gambler?' "

Interesting info on storage, salt caverns. Cheapest way to store lotsa
H2 as it turns out.. And they are found mostly in oil-rich regions!

I have a feeling we can innovate out of this prob though.. Or we
already did. Isn't NH3 suitable for large-scale storage?

"Friedman [an economic conservative], and other leading economists,
also expressed views that pained social conservatives, including
support for immigration, the legalization of drugs, and gay
rights. Many social conservatives had hesitations about the 1964
presidential campaign of the libertarian Barry Goldwater; many
economic conservatives were pained by the racist agenda of George
Wallace’s 1968 presidential campaign. Yet by the 1970s the two camps
had found a sufficient patch of common ground: social conservatives
who feared for their moral values and economic conservatives who
feared for their property values both felt profoundly threatened by
the expansion of government. Religious leaders including Robert
Schuller, pastor of the Garden Grove Community Church in Orange
County, synthesized the two strains of conservatism by characterizing
the pursuit of wealth as a moral enterprise. Schuller called his
church a “shopping center for God” and told his congregants, “You have
a God-ordained right to be wealthy.”  \#appelbaum

[The Nobel Prize in Economics is] a plan deliberately designed to
undermine democracy, hatched by a small group, and made possible with
the magic of royalty ...

For 80 years, central banks have tussled with elected governments,
especially social democratic ones wanting full employment & housing
rather than ‘market discipline’. In a big power struggle in Sweden in
the mid-1960s, the Swedish Central Bank lost but plotted revenge… 

The central bank – the Riksbank – persuaded the Nobel Foundation for
the first and only time in its history to award a new Nobel in
‘economic sciences’ in 1969. The bank still funds the prize. Although
not a Nobel, it was designed to mimic the originals in every way. The
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics has the same prize money & is given
at the same ceremony as the science prizes by the Swedish King.
 
But, it’s always been controversial. Alfred Nobel’s descendants called
the prize, “a cuckoo in the Nobel Prize nest”. Economists on the left
& right has won the prize, but it has helped led to the dominance of
one type of economics above all others. Neoclassical economics built
on unicorn assumptions of perfect markets and rational behaviour,
which failed in the global financial crisis. Prizes have gone to
economists who ‘prove’ that governments’ attempts to control the
market were doomed to failure ..."

G-7 message was "we need Russia". Then there are signs things will
revolve more around a joint US-RU understanding / control in ME,

empires, geo "has-beens", inheritors of goat-fucker agro-mafia
cultures, such as TR, Iran, or even China always wanting to "make a

"Proponents of faith in markets also developed a close relationship
with the corporate elite, which was not as inevitable as it may seem
in retrospect. Conservative economists like [Milton] Friedman and his
close friend George Stigler initially expressed fear of corporate
power and argued that restraining corporate concentration was one of
the few legitimate functions of government. Some conservative
economists still do. But many decided to make common cause with
corporations against government power." \#appelbaum

"For some, the battle against tax havens has been viewed as lost from
the start. From London to Delaware, from Hong Kong to Zurich, offshore
banking centers are essential cogs in the financial machine of
capitalism, used by the rich and powerful throughout the world. We
can’t do anything about them, we’re told: some countries will always
impose less tax and fewer rules than their neighbors. Money will
always find a safe haven: strike here, it will go over
there. Capitalism without tax havens is a utopia, and a progressive
taxation of income and fortunes is destined to fail, unless we choose
the path of protectionism.

For others, the battle has almost been won. Thanks to the determination of governments and to multiple scandals and revelations, tax havens will soon die out. From the harsh words of large countries seeking new solutions ever since the financial crisis, they have all promised to abandon banking secrecy, and
multinationals will finally be forced to open their books and pay what they owe. This is the triumph of virtue. What is missing in this debate is data. Tax evasion by the wealthiest individuals and large corporations can be stopped" -- Zucman, *Hidden Wealth of Nations*
