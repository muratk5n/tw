become. Reps u sorta expect, but them too? Sad.</p>

<p>The only possible "decisive" Brexit deal is a no-deal Brexit. I cant stress enough how nonchalant the EU is on a UK leave. Juncker was like "if you want to leave, leave. If you want to stay, stay". It is comical really.</p>

<p>Biden talked out of his ass in earlier tries but then he was having fun then. He isnt now, he looks more focused, serious. Which can be a problem. He came clean for bunch of stuff in the beginning, which can only be the result of a staff brainstorm "what are our weaknesses"</p>
<hr />
<p>.. so the operation looks more disciplined. </p>

<p>In the negative, yes, they are sleepy. </p>

<p>They set this up all nice and easy for Trump (at least on paper). Iraq, Afganistan invasions themselves helped surround Iran, the next invasion. Judging by the Mr Mustache appointment DJT probably isnt too disinterested in regime change himself.</p>
<p>Add to that racheting up oil import restrictions, this is moving towards some kind of change.</p>
