# Week 26

Haha.. Swalvel landed a punch on Bootyjudge, so did Partypooper
Hickenlooper. Here is the thing, Hick is probably the more capable
mayor and he'd handle the sit better than Booty who just looks good on
TV.

People are going after Bootyjudge his 4-5% must be mouthwatering to
them, they want to take some of that. Like Beto who undeservedly has
some pop. When in doubt hit the media boy.

Bernie is doing good; Biden plays it stoic, no mistakes so far. It's all abt how things look, so he looks Presidential even if you wrote down the his words on paper and read them he'd come across inebriated. 

Yang looks prepared.

\#demdebate

Then what's the difference, dumbass? Consumers pays no difference, fossil companies pay no difference, than what's the incentive to go carbon free? 

Was that John Delaney? Has 0.5%. That is TOO MUCH. U need to drop out son.

"I will credit consumers for the carbon tax I will levy on fossil companies [who will surely pass the cost on to the consumers]".

So say we all

They are all fine people obviously, no doubt there. Except maybe Beto. haha

I just saw it in my mind's eye.. I don't know what final votes BdB gets, but if not high, and Bernie or Warren make it, BdB would be great VP. VPs are usually picked for balance right? A younger mayor balancing an older senator?

---

It's great de Blasio banging on the point the Democratic Party lost its way. No pandering, no nothing. Just smash. Very good.

\#demdebate1

I am not for Russiagate but when de Blasio hits Trump on Russia, it cracks me up. Is that bias?

\#demdebate1

---

Fair question on carbon pricing. If it's not working, well, regulate
fossil out of existence. Isn't that your f--ing job? Regulating for
the good of public?

Maybe pricing carbon is akin to punting as in the case of
healthcare. "Let the markets decide [on who lives, dies, how drugs are
priced in a world of research subsidies, patent monopolies]". Yeah,
good luck with that.

\#demdebate1

---

Everybody wants to take from Beto, however much he's left anyway. Hit
Beto, take his 2,3%. 

---

Do you have to drop to that bitchy accent when u say Spanish words
inside an English convo? If the other side of the conversation cant or
wont do that, isnt that kinda refusing to meet ppl half way? It's as
if u r saying "I am different than you" in an unnecessary way. Kinda a
childish indep tantrum.

---

Man centrists are scared shitless of Warren. They put her in the kids
table first, then put Beto next to her so she would be physically
towered over.

Also De Blasio is one tough son of a bitch. A fighter. My #2 after
Bernie, #3 is Warren.

It's crazy such a young guy with no prev gov experience like Kush was

It's freaky how I land on the subjects for my articles; I am studying
underactuated robotics, watching Tedrake intro, at night one
Battlestar Galactica ep in the background is showing Adamo and Apollo
boxing, Adamo is saying "you never lose control son, that's why you
lose". That's it - the article.

"@itme_esor My family has $250,000 of student debt between my brother, mom & myself. Under Warren's plan, we would be left w/ upwards of $100,000 of debt. Under Bernie's plan, we would be free & my 67-year-old father wouldn't have to work for the next 10 yrs. #CancelStudentDebt. ALL of it."

No problem. There is apathy towards her on my side, some use her as a
anti-war-bludgeon which is fine, but there are other issues as well
that she is not too vocal about. All that leads to apathy so it's like
"why do I care?". The answer needs to be positive, in a big way, bcz
this is abt the executive and politics is more than issues, it's about
a leader.

Forget this grid business. Generate ammonia, hydrogen from excess
energy, ship it in trucks to other parts of the country. At
first. Then u can start thinking abt pipelines to transport it as
gas. With gas u could perhaps utilize fossil infra, and their people,
and free riding on the pol network of the fossil mothaf-ckas too. They
got them connections.

The mystery of Egypt.. Roman architecture.. The propaganda will have

not two but in three major works! Not even Darth Vader pulled that off
(he was in a mere two, he was kinda, partly good in the third).
