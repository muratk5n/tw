<p>I been to so many Sbucks stores in so many different countries that if
there was an award for this sort of thing, I am sure I'd win it. I
seek them out whereever I go too.. I could be in Philippenes Cebu City

<p>National Dem polling might be misleading, regional ones, since cands
probably put more energy there, could be more indicative. Iowa, New
Hamp, South Car, Cali are 5, 7, 22, 1 ahead for Biden (ahead of the
next most pop cand). So SC needs some attention.. Whoever is after the
nom, needs to clean his clock in South Carolina.</p>

<p>Good profiling trick: look at intense disagg, conflict - usually the
two sides of the conf have the same type. Like Varoufuckis vs
Schauble, both are Mellow Meadow. Who gets the most brutal digs into
Trump?  Colbert. Etc..</p>
<p>Whatever we might know of other types, we only truly now our own
kind.</p>
<p>And when someone like us does something wrong, we insinctively know
where it comes from, so the attacks can be more pointed.</p>

<p>It's all bunk. Follow this crap at your own expense. The FAQ (one of
the links Woit shared) says 'the experiments are, unfortunately, not
likely to offer many insight or opportunities for surprise; the result
can be predicted with very high confidence long in advance. QD is
roughly about demonstrating the internal (theoretical) compatibility
of unitary quantum dynamics with the appearance of classicality (and,
in particular, wavefunction collapse)'.</p>

experiments designed to exhibit actual toy examples of the idea in

in this context)"</p>

<p>Yes because such systems are the easiest to find the data for, and ML
is extremely reliant on data. Like, "does the picture have a cat or
not?". You can find training data very easily for that.</p>

<p>He is right. Sethian works with PDEs (used in phy) on all kinds of
interesting problems. We need more of this, but instead a lot of brain
power is wasted on the "statistical thing", where practitioners mainly
chase more and more data.</p>

<p>Mathematical physics has lots of "forms". These are precooked
formulations, like Euler-Lagrange, or the Hamiltonian. U need a
certain thing find thr form for it, plug in, done.</p>

<p>Johnson and Nixon did more for moon landing than JFK. Johnson
recommended moonlanding as a goal to begin with. But JFK looks good on
TV (and is a LTCB type like Beto always getting more accolades than
they deserve) so he is sadly the "front man" for this historical
moment.</p>

<p>Some said TG movie feels like a commercial rather than a movie. It's
true. You could take any 5 second sequence from most of it, and mumble
the name of some product afterwards and it would be like a commercial.</p>

<p>Funny story - guy walks up to M. Ironside one day and says "f$!#k
you!". MI is like WTH? Apparently dude was so inspired by <em>Top Gun</em> he
joined the mil, became a fighter pilot, but the life wasn't like the
movie. He was pissed.</p>

<p>Cruise says the new <em>Top Gun</em> is a love letter to aviation. I get the
