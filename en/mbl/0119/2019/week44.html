is? Fight with Skynet, humanity wins. The end.</p>

<p>Rethinking the Role of Banks in Economics Education by Keen.</p>
<p>That software can generate running code BTW from the differential
equations those diagrams are based on. Econs, check it out.</p>
<p>F--in Krugman still thinks "banks lend deposits they receive from
other customers". What a douche.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3g6-hPFFS_0?t=73">Link</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Supermarkets may not make money by selling bread either (low margins,
maybe), but customers would want it, and they'd buy many other things
while they are in the store. I don't pay attn to these atomic,
single-use explanations. </p>
<p>"Facebook: We have no motive around pol ads, we don't make money from them"</p>
<hr />
<p>Twitter bans political ads. That is their prerogative.</p>
<p>Allowing ads and not filtering, or no ads. </p>
<hr />
<p>I am a sucker for bios. I use them and ppl in them as filters, as
examplars for a time, a concept, a certain way of living. If you have
SocDyn gene you can build from there. I focus on dividing
characteristics the most, the attribute that creates most
contrast. Like in Jesse Ventura's bio <em>I Ain't Got Time to Bleed</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I might have gone a lot further in Hollywood if I had been willing to
move there.  At one point Arnold Schwarzenegger asked me when I was
going to move out there and become one of the boys. I said, “Well,
what about the schools?”  Arnold replied, “Don’t worry about the
schools. You put your kids in private school.”  That’s what stopped
me. I thought, “I’m not living in a place where my kids have to go to
private school.” I’m not knocking private schools, but I believe that
I owe it to my kids to let them grow up in a place where private
school isn’t required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was filed away in my head &gt;20 yrs ago. Why? It shows a hard-core
left position for someone you might not expect it from (big, brusque,
media guy), it shows clear contrast with some1 from Europe (a place
more left than US), who did not care, so on.</p>
<hr />
<p>No need for anything magical as explanation.. IMO it is the law of
averages. We all know the average, conciously or subconsiously, on
many types of behaviours. Say risk taking, listening,
controlling.. Then we see ppl who are worse than average on these
things, a small fraction of the soc in large for each type, and we act
accordingly, automatically pushing ppl to where they need to be.</p>
<p>"U say sometimes it looks as if everyone conspires to push people in
their development path. How is that possible?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Fitting. Especially thinking how Twain was in his time. Very much

<hr />
<p>Snowden, <em>Permanent Record</em></p>
<p>"The NSA described XKEYSCORE, in the documents I’d later pass on to
journalists, as its “widest-ranging” tool, used to search “nearly
everything a user does on the Internet.” The technical specs I studied
went into more detail as to how exactly this was accomplished—by
“packetizing” and “sessionizing,” or cutting up the data of a user’s
online sessions into manageable packets for analysis—but nothing could
prepare me for seeing it in action.</p>
<p>It was, simply put, the closest thing to science fiction I’ve ever
seen in science fact: an interface that allows you to type in pretty
much anyone’s address, telephone number, or IP address, and then
basically go through the recent history of their online activity. In
some cases you could even play back recordings of their online
sessions, so that the screen you’d be looking at was their screen,
whatever was on their desktop. You could read their emails, their
browser history, their search history, their social media postings,
everything [..]</p>
<p>I didn’t type the names of the agency director or the president into
XKEYSCORE, but after enough time with the system I realized I could
have. Everyone’s communications were in the system—everyone’s. I was
initially fearful that if I searched those in the uppermost echelons
of state, I’d be caught and fired, or worse. But it was surpassingly
simple to disguise a query regarding even the most prominent figure by
encoding my search terms in a machine format that looked like
gibberish to humans but would be perfectly understandable to
XKEYSCORE"</p>

genres of hype about string theory and supposed new fundamental
physics. The first is the old-school genre of string theory hype we’ve
now been seeing for 35 years: “string theory makes a testable
prediction” (no, it doesn’t). The second is the new, post-modern
variety: no actual theory, just a grandiose claim that space and time

<p>E.T. existence is not unlikely. I could not disprove it easily from

<p>E.T. hiding from humans actually explains the absence of contact, the

<p>I follow Steven Greer sometimes (the UFOlogist), and about some event
he'll say "the E.T. will not allow it!". This one topic was about
nukes in space, apparently we tried to put nukes there, E.T. destroyed
it. So they don't allow nukes in space.</p>
<p>Now I find myself trying to figure out the politics of E.T. What would
they be for? Would they be for tax cuts? Or against tax cuts?  They
are not climate skeptics apparently (so says SG). I think there is
more mystery here than the E.T.</p>

<p>I read Jackie Chan's autobiography, somewhere in it he says something
like being proud of his China heritage.. But he is from
Hong-Kong. Wonder what he thinks now, because the protestors in HK
find mainland CH system as illegitimate, their old system as
better. JC owes much of his fame and success to Hong-Kong. System-wise
and culturally, Taiwan, HK are the free Chinese, and the mainland CH
are the outsiders in this picture, seen as illegitimate.</p>

<p>Snowden, <em>Permanent Record</em></p>
<p>"On Constitution Day 2012, I picked up the document in earnest... I
read through it in its entirety, from the Articles to the
Amendments. I was surprised to be reminded that fully 50 percent of
the Bill of Rights, the document’s first ten amendments, were intended
to make the job of law enforcement harder. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
Seventh, and Eighth Amendments were all deliberately, carefully
designed to create inefficiencies and hamper the government’s ability
to exercise its power and conduct surveillance...</p>
<p>In fact, many of the rights ... aren’t even provided for in law except
by implication. They exist in that open-ended empty space created
through the restriction of government power. For example, Americans
only have a “right” to free speech because the government is forbidden
from making any law restricting that freedom, and a “right” to a free
press because the government is forbidden from making any law to
abridge it. They only have a “right” to worship freely because the
government is forbidden from making any law respecting an
establishment of religion, and a “right” to peaceably assemble and
protest because the government is forbidden from making any law that
says they can’t" </p>

<p>Have a feeling these "followers of Otto" have been supported by
Germany for a long time, owing to the WWI alliance back in the day?
"Pan-Otto" ideals were supported by DE then bcz they were hoping it
would destabilize the British in Asia. Hopefully this support
ends. It'll lead nowhere good. There are as many Kurds as tigger in
Germany, and their clashes can

<p>Even if media, ppl influences didn't exist, same culture codes would
still be transmitted. They say Americans are loud. Well it's a huge
country. I bet if you calculate the distance ppl stand from eachother
on average, it'd come out to be higher than, say, Hong Kong. So ppl
speak louder to make themselves heard. It's physics.</p>

<p>"There is really an enormous number of problems where derivatives are
unavailable but one has imperative practical reasons for wanting to do
some optimization. It is almost a natural perversity that practical
problems today are often complex, nonlinear, and not sufficiently
explicitly defined to give reliable derivatives. Indeed, such problems
were always numerous, but, 30 years ago, when nonlinear optimization
techniques were relatively more naive than they are today, even the
most optimistic practitioners would not try to optimize such complex
problems." #introDerivativeFreeOpt</p>
