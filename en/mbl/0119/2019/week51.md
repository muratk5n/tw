# Week 51


Another research, which looked at parliamentary vs presidential
systems in terms of economy, came up with a different answer: purely
parliamentary system.

[Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-018-0552-2) by McManus et al.

I dont have the time to dig into this yet (to replicate it in Python)
-- here is [the data](PvsPData.csv.zip)
(from Dr. McManus).

eSpeak sucks. Who wrote this shit?

Cloud Speech! Right.

Why is most tts (text-to-speech) code out there 
based on Deep Shit now? 

Speech at its simplest is 1D data. It can be represented by a sum of sine waves - u could extract those base waves through sinusoidal regression. Save those regression results in a DB per each word (how many are there, like 20-30K?) and for TTS, while reading doc per word look up its waves, sum them up, play, repeat.

(Of course according to *Time for Change* model, both Clinton and Bam
had a major advantage going into their elections -the incumbent was
unpopular due to his delivery-, but, at least they didn't lose like
Gore)

---

In the past 30+ yrs we've seen the opposite (of Corb) from the left
leaders - Clinton, Blair, Bama - suave, hipters who can get elected,
but cannot deliver left leaving an electoral disaster behind (it is
the policy execution that has staying power, not lip biting). Corbyn
was stiff who probably could deliver left. Ideally u want both (speak
left, be a closer, get elected, then deliver left).

---

Basically the motto is get elected, somehow, then deliver left, ppl
will feel the diff and vote for you. Parties who did not do that have
been disappearing - we talk a lot abt US, UK, how Dem equivalents are
miserable there, but in Germany too, bcz of "Third Way" Schroder SPD
cratered. Clinton, Blair hipsterism will only carry you so far.

What is a low correlation portfolio and why is it good?

It's simple - prices form a time series, then low or negative
correlation would mean one is down when the other is not, vica
versa. So if one instrument took a hit, the others would save you. The
"bad"s cancel out, and, if tests show, overall, the portfolio
generates returns, we are a-ok.

Correlation between two series is known to many. How about correlation
of 3 series or more? For that, there is the correlation matrix. Say we
have Apple, IBM, and Exxon,

```python
import pandas as pd, pandas_datareader.data as web, datetime

start=datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 1)
end=datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 1)
insts1 = ['AAPL','IBM','XOM']
df1 = web.DataReader(insts1, 'yahoo', start, end)['Adj Close']
ret = df1.pct_change()
H = ret.corr()
w = np.ones((1,len(insts1))) * 1./len(insts1)
print ('score', np.float(np.dot(np.dot(w,H), w.T)))
```

```text
score 0.6021293830308531
```

Correlation matrix of the prices gives H, then `w'H w` gives a single
score to judge to portfolio by.  `w` is the weights, how we allocate /
distribute money to each instrument. For simplicity we picked
equal. 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.

In this example we see intra-correlation is high (1 would be
highest). Can we do better? There are two tech stocks in there, AAPL
and IBM. How about we replace IBM with a retail-ish tech stock? Say
Amazon?

```python
insts2 = ['AAPL','AMZN','XOM']
df2 = web.DataReader(insts2, 'yahoo', start, end)['Adj Close']
ret = df2.pct_change()
H = ret.corr()
print ('score', np.float(np.dot(np.dot(w,H), w.T)))
```

```text
score 0.548369645733854
```

The correlation went down. If the overall returns prove (backtest)
better, this is the better portfolio.

Ideally u want correlation to be a big fat zero. These were just
random symbols off the top of my head

The fight. "Learning" statistically as in deep nets vs. formulating
the problem somehow starting from principles... A similar version of
this fight actually [took place](https://www.tor.com/2011/06/21/norvig-vs-chomsky-and-the-fight-for-the-future-of-ai/)
between Chomsky and Norvig (of Google) a while back on natural
language processing. Chomsky does not like ML methods. I'd say he is
right on this one.

(Chomsky knows a thing or two about stats u see, hard sciences and
experiment, so can speak on such issues with some authority)

A lot of the successes of the recent AI methods (which are great and I
applaud) are in the category of weak AI. This is the first level of
pattern recognition - especially for to/fro conversion type tasks if
you remain in the same domain, e.g. speech sounds to text of those
sounds u can do some damage, the "AI" methods can work. But
interpreting that speech, translating its ideas are still far out of
reach.

We also talked about clean formulas vs. constants before (which DL ppl
call weights or coefficients) in physics context. Basically in that
formula vs. weights trade-off, DL chose **all** weights, all the
time. Their "models" such as they are, can have *millions* of
weights. This is the price you pay for not burning brain cells on
formulating, modeling a problem.

Sign of incoming trouble - the diff between YoY hiring and wage growth
starts to
[widen](../../2021/01/stats.html#wagepayroll).
The widening gap is a forward indicator. It makes sense from a macro
perspective, in late cycle labor conditions tighten, wages increase,
firms' profits start to go down, also their hiring starts to decrease,
on and on it goes until the **pop**

Realist interpretation of physics can be based on "human
interpretable" constructs and still be real - meaning stuff that
exists wout observer being there. I think the problem with these
comments is its use of "common sense" and "everyday". What is the
elements, the clay from which these comments are formed? For the
non-technical they are springs, pulleys, balls, wind, elasticity,
force, movement, stuff rotating around other stuff (atoms, or planets)
or simulacra (easily relatable these days thanks to movies).

The "everyday" items for STEM ppl are graphs, matrices, DEs, the
interplay btw the continuous and the discrete..  Graphs can be
directed, non-directed, some algorithms can work on them, in various
speeds, like shortest path, minimum spanning tree, etc.

This is important, because you can construct a reality from these
structures. Like a game - and the root of the game would be a
graph. Or a probability distribution (needs pseudorandomness knowledge
which isnt really random), still **real**, same for everyone.

I'd say realists vs crackers are divided half'n half these days, among
those who matter... So the former group is nothing to be dismissed.

"There is still something so radical in quantum physics that we cannot
translate in our spontaneous everyday ontology and I think all these
theories try desperately to translate it back in some kind of
understandable for our common sense ontology" -- Zizek

Tiggers be flailing on IRel - the odd behaviour is partially due to a
"little Putin" strategy. Little Putin strategy takes a page out of
Putin's playbook ; you find areas, regions where the other side does
not want to be involved completely, so you get involved 100% bcz u
know the backlash wont be severe, so u cause some discomfort for the
other side. Like Russia invading Georgia, the West doesnt like it, but
will not engage militarily, it doesnt worth that much to them, so u
look tough. Tigger obviously cannot do this at the scale RU can,
that's why I call it the "little Putin strategy".

It's a way of looking tough - but in fact, it's like acting like a
little bitch isn't it? Engaging in something when your security isn't
truly at stake, against someone who is not a threat, and usually not
in the same class. Just to get some headlines?

At least RU can argue it has *some* strategical reasons to be pursuing
their Putin strategy, for TR, already a Western ally, the little Putin
strategy makes zero sense.

happen, see [Gellner](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2013/03/allegience-of-peon-4.html)
who wrote the book on nationhood,

>People can be categorized as tall and short, as fat and thin, dark and light, and in many other ways. Clearly, there is simply no limit to the number of ways in which people can be classified. Most of the possible classifications will be of no interest whatever. But some of them become socially and politically very important. They are those which I am tempted to call entropy-resistant.
>
>A classification is entropy-resistant if it is based on an attribute which has a marked tendency not to become, even with the passage of time since the initial establishment of an industrial society, evenly dispersed throughout the entire society. In such an entropy-resistant case, those individuals who are characterized by the trait in question tend to be concentrated in one part or on the totality of society. The rest of this argument can now easily be anticipated: entropy-resistant traits constitute a very serious problem for industrial society.

Well, noone should run these ppl over, displace them, or destroy
them. They'd need their own local governance, Scots, the Irish, or the
Uighurs.

"In research published in Nature Communications recently, scientists
from UNSW Sydney, Griffith University and Swinburne University of
Technology showed that capturing hydrogen by splitting it from oxygen
in water can be achieved by using low-cost metals like iron and nickel
as catalysts, which speed up this chemical reaction while requiring
less energy"
