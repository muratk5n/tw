<p>I support the the left wing agenda. If modernity is to continue u need industrial left to balance industrial (and peasant) right. </p>

<p>Can we have a tech personality who just makes existing tech better?
Like THE TRAIN. Dude takes that, and makes a better TRAIN. Would that
work? Would the media pay attention to this person? Would he have
fanboys salivating at his announcements?</p>

<p>Dear All Technology,</p>
<p>Remember the 90’s when you just WORKED??? I don’t need a ‘smart’
feature on my TV, thermostat, lights, music, refrigerator, security
cameras, and f-ing car. You’re a major pain in all of our
asses. You’re not worth it.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Everyone</p>
