It's crazy I was just thinking about this today; a pure H2 pipeline (not even mixing it with existing natgas pipeline -UK showed it works-), something only for H2.

---

There are many types of fuel cells, not just hydrogen. There are even petroleum, LPG fuel cells. No combustion, just fuel -> catalyst -> electricity. They usually "reform" the fuel into H2 tho, and IMO that step would be easiest for NH3.

---

No ACs for Iraqis then?

So many thing wrong with that sentence.. During summer you'd have sunshine like mad. Where r ur panels?

"Iraq cannot provide electricity to its citizens especially during summer when temp is above 50 deg celcius"

---

This was 2017. Every fuel-cell contraption you see, be it from LPG, has a reforming phase, having to generate H2. This thing does it naturally at room temp from ammonia.

"H2 production from ammonia triggered at room temperature with an acidic RuO2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.”

A small addition, Mueller was not fired bcz Graham indicated he and like minded Senate collaegues would not be happy with that (whose votes u need for stopping impeachement). This was  a great b-of-power demonstration.

Yes it is politically hard to DJT to give up on NK denuke. Un has no incentive to do it either. Which leads us to a patron; Un needs a patron to give him an out, to trade, etc. He doesn't want the Chinese for some reason, that leaves the Russians.

S-400 is part of political tigga lie blaming US for coup attempt when in fact it was the reverse; anti-West, pro RU forces did that. S-400 also is a way to placate them. It's theather.
