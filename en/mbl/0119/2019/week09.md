Yea - there ain't enough cowshit to fuel such transport (assuming the

Britain "pondered the TR model". Why? Bcz it has free-trade deal but no freedom of mvmt in EU?

Hmm.. code for work is WHO YOU ARE; but if ppl are working on what they like, wout pay, I wonder if that still counts. So UBI could be fine in that sense.

The code for money is PROOF tho, so that could be a problem. Unless money eventually received from work while being supported by UBI is sold as a positive.

This is how you deal with codes; u dont solve based on them, only morons do that, think culturally. U sell to them.
