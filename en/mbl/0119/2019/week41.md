Nope, yoghurt was not invented by the tigga as thought by some dumb
nats (who also think they are "Central Asian"). It is Middle Eastern
(agro, farm animals, milk leads to yoghurt -also a little sheep
fucking, invading your near neighbors etc-). Greeks eat lots of
yoghurt too, and call it "Greek Yoghurt".

Interesting take on China. Sounds like a static culture to which
change comes to, rather than the other way around.

The wording sounds like Bernie's.

the federal government on 'environmental justice'"

Quinnipac, Monmouth, Economist (kinda) do say that, yes.

"Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, and Joe Biden are statistically
tied for first place in polls of the Democratic presidential race,
with about 26% support" -- Bloomberg

---

Yes the contrast is clear; in US the oil industry produced an
innovator like JDR, in many other places it fueled tyrannical regimes
with zero innovation like in [fill in the blanks]. Sad.

---

Actually that stuff, plus pipelines etc came later. JDR was primarily
a refiner. He built an enourmous expertise around engineering,
processing, and basically managing a tech company. He is also AFAIK
the only person who made more money after retirement than before
retirement because when he built the biz, oil was for heating, lamps.
Then cars came to the scene, the profits of his businesses (and the
value of the stocks he still held after retirement)
exploded (see the bio *Titan*).

Fingers crossed for the next JDR in hydrogen. I hope that person
becomes so successful the business eventually gets broken up!

"Rockefeller made so much money from oil drilling!"

Since it is set to replace fossil fuels I wouldnt be surprised. Oil

"The unnamed person at the center of this story sure didn’t sound like
a whistleblower. Our intelligence community wouldn’t wipe its ass with
a real whistleblower.

Americans who’ve blown the whistle over serious offenses by the
federal government either spend the rest of their lives overseas, like
Edward Snowden, end up in jail, like Chelsea Manning, get arrested and
ruined financially, like former NSA official Thomas Drake, have their
homes raided by FBI like disabled NSA vet William Binney, or get
charged with espionage like ex-CIA exposer-of-torture John
Kiriakou. It’s an insult to all of these people, and the suffering
they’ve weathered, to frame the ballcarrier in the Beltway’s latest
partisan power contest as a whistleblower" -- Taibbi

So ppl who trade options use a volatility assumption for their
pricing, whose average (once reverse-engineered from the price) can be
used as an indication of future volatility.

HEye uses implied vol (reverse engineered from options) as predictor
for future vol, no? There is some good math here, Black-Scholes,
reverse-engineer with little root-finding.. whazzuuuup!

I want to see more boring people, innovating quietly. Gov can lead the

So a combo of internal politics (losing local elecs) and wanting to
displace Kurds near the border (cuz they are all "terrorists") are the
reason for the incursion. Here's the
[about-face](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2019-10-09/turkeys-endgame-syria)
done around nationalism.

"Northeastern Syria is not a no-man’s land. A March 1 Washington
Institute for Near East Policy article says, 'According to
[geographer] Fabrice Balanche, around 850,000 people currently reside
in the proposed 20-mile-deep zone bounded by the Euphrates River on
the west and the Tigris River on the east. They include 650,000 Kurds
(76%), 180,000 Sunni Arabs (21%), 10,000 Turkmens (1%), and 10,000
Christians (1%).'"

The log-oscillations of DS math are inspired by materials before
breaking point, akin to when a person lifts and holds something near
their max strength, before they run out of stamina and drop the object
the muscles do these mini-shakes, IMO they are similar to these
log-oscillations.

Sornette upped his game on bubble prediction. Now he computes a bubble
score, and combines it with the valution of a stock, he creates four
quadrants, bottom right for example is for stocks that are overvalued
and have a bubble formed. A contrarian seller can use that signal.

<img width="500" src="twimg/EGI1zJhXYAEUIT_.png"/>

This style of bubble detection is slightly more advanced than "Black
Swans" which in a way simply means "shit happens". Pretty crude
observation which, shockingly, was unknown to many traders.

Talked abt Didier's approach here before
([link](../2017/week12.html#sornette), [link](../../2015/10/didier-sornette.html)).

Or 1 can simply buy *whey* protein (sold in powder form) which is
fittingly extracted from the cheese making process. 1 might notice the
compound tastes strangely like the meal replacement powders, like
XLS. So these powders probably just use whey.

Meat has all 9 (hence our obsession with it), but these 9 aminos are
not exclusive to meat. Cheese has them too.

Still to animaly? If 1 is careful, a combo of beans, almonds, berries,
apple, nuts, cacao can do the trick, in nature this would be
"gathering" part of hunting-gathering.

"There are 23 proteinogenic (protein building) amino acids in total
... Of the proteinogenic amino acids, 9 are essential .. Essential
amino acids are not produced naturally by the body, so they have to be
obtained from the foods we eat"

What's the point of Mars again? It cannot be terraformed so you have
to live in closed encampments, just like on the Moon. Why travel for
frickin months to get the same experience? Pointless. We need to focus
on planets, or "planetary bodies" that have a future.

If Mars is "done", i.e. flagpole, footprints on the ground kinda deal,
I'd close that chapter, and shift the focus to Titan.

"That money is trapped. This is a constant refrain whispered by
corporate leaders in high places. According to well-placed finance
experts, companies such as Chevron, Exxon, Sony, and BMW have billions
of dollars in earnings in China. But they can’t repatriate their
money. China refuses to let it leave the country, because it needs
those dollars. Numerous investment community sources have told me
that, as far as they know, China has not allowed the significant
repatriation of any Western investor funds since 2015" -- Spalding, *Stealth War*

Obviously the bag needs its own rain protection.
