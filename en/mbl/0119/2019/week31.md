This debate has less gimmicks, weird exchanges. At least in terms of
overall flair, it is better.

Biden looks tired, mellow; but when young, with more energy, that's
when he was doing all that dumb stuff. So now he looks like shit was
kicked out of him, but perversely, he is making less mistakes because
of that.

Wahahahahaa

"But, u can throw a Tesla in there, it blows up and that makes a good flame too! "

Grand. Steel production makes up around 7% of total global emissions. Kill that a good amt of gh gas goes away.

Summary: Europeans want to switch to H2 for steelmaking, but it needs to come from renewable sources, Sweden has advantage here. 

BTW: for steel prod, there are no clean alternatives to H2. They use
the gas directly in the furnace to create a flame at very high
temparatures.

"We have slashed and burned the core features of childhood ...

In the past 10,000 years — a barely perceptible sliver of evolutionary time — virtually every feature of childhood has changed, particularly in industrialized societies. Instead of growing up in a mixed-age collective, our children spend most of their time indoors with same-age peers. Gone are the days of evading grown-ups: Constant supervision is expected. Recess, the last vestige of free play, is on the brink of extinction. I contributed to this myself as a camp counselor, shepherding kids to structured activities, convinced that by teaching them rules or settling their disputes, I was helping them grow.

I don’t think this anymore.

In a broad sci curriculum, I dont think it is necessary to include
Laplace Transform. Or gazillion diff ways to solve ODE's
analytically. Skip all that, save time or other things, use SymPy

Now Deep Shit kept at minimum, but intertwined with a concise math
model is more interesting to me. Like
[this](https://ragulpr.github.io/2016/12/22/WTTE-RNN-Hackless-churn-modeling/)
churn prediction model; it already made some choices on Survival
Analysis (solid math), Weibull distribution (solid math), then the
model brings everything to a point where you have to estimate some
stuff, than you hand it over to.. the shit.

Baltimore's problems are not the making of Cummings obviously; they

Millenials like Seinfeld? I guess the non-snowflaky ones. Here is ep
*The Wizard*;

"The gang can’t figure out if Elaine’s new boyfriend is part
black. Determined to figure out his ethnicity, Elaine asks several
inadvertent questions about his heritage. After hearing hip-hop music
blaring from his apartment and noticing his collection of African
masks, Elaine is confident of his blackness. She even calls the black
waitress “sister” and says, “It’s okay, my boyfriend is black,” at
which point he arrives and tells her he is in fact white and assumed
she was Hispanic because her last name is Benes. She says she is not,
and they conclude, “So we’re just a couple of white people?”

There are posts out there describing this ep as racist BTW.

Race-blindness is obvs better. But if a race issue is on your mind,
why not talk abt it?

fell next to eachother. But grammatically it is correct so he kept
it. That's when I knew a white guy wrote it. Because only a white guy

Libertards are farm-dwelling folk in mind, if not in actuality. They
like to have their "land" with its "borders", they'll bury their gold
in there, whose value should not go down... wife and lots of kids,
maybe with a goat on the side, and they'll live happily
everafter... They don't care what happens outside. This is the dream
for these muppets.

Mainstream scifi has a thing for turning AI into irreplacable "people"; Trek had virtual doctor being sent somewhere, than he would not exist at the source. He was gone, like a person.  

This is software.. It can exist in two places.

Same thing in *Another Life*, virtual assis code wants to go into
another program, everyone is like "oh no, what if we lose you?"

Lose? Do you have backups?

Nixon had some game.. too bad all that other stuff that came at the
end. He quit the gold standard like that - snap. Nearly did UBI, moon
landing was in his time.. where are such gutsy moves now? World / US

as if in a Woody Allen movie.

Haha..! Nixon had Cheney and Rummy run tests, do research on UBI

Nice vid on Boris' gg father

[Vid](https://youtu.be/jcK63Zqry5Q)

He was against oppressive nats which is fine. But he also came out
against the nat liberation move later (against foreign occup, post
WW1), they were loosely connected with 1st group of nats... Tough
stance. He was lynched btw. Ugly; and fitting for a peasant empire
culture.

*Another Life* critics seem to be piling on the "it is like this, like
that other mov" angle. I dont care AL is like something else. How
many different ways can u have aliens arrive to Earth anyway? Take
the show on its own merits. Is it enjoyable if this was one one of
the few scifi shows u had seen?

"The Renewable Energy Extension Act of 2019 would provide a 5-year
extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and residential renewable
energy tax credit for solar, delaying the incremental phase out that
Congress passed in 2015. In addition to solar, the bill extends the
ITC for other clean energy technologies set to phase out, such as
fiber-optic solar, fuel cells, small wind, microturbines, combined
heat and power, and geothermal heat pumps

Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory
Booker (D-N.J.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chris
Van Hollen (D-Md.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Kirsten
Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Kamala D. Harris

No US is [not an empire](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2015/01/not-empire.html) by its foundation.

But the petrodollar hegemony is certainly pushing it that way, which
creates tension.

US founders were not white supremacists. Jefferson and GW did hold
slaves, but were for eventual equality. Slaveholders in the first
Congress were minority. New Englanders like John Adams (the second
President) abhorred it. They wanted to abolish it outright but saw it
would cause problems with the South. So they tabled the issue for 80
years. When the issue came back the Civil War ensued.

"[Commenting on Beyond Meat] interesting stats , 60% of beef market is low quality fast food / pet food. 50% of earths land is assigned to grazing . 18% of the co2 comes from cows . 80% of the oat and corn crops is fed to cows. It's still a silly valuation but one of these  impairs will make cows obsolete"
