<p>WWII was an second-wave industrial war. Just like unskilled, automaton
workers were ordered to do grunt work on the assembly line, unskilled
soldiers were sent to do repetitive, automaton work on the battle
field (the disassembly line). Both industrial left and right have no
problems with that war for this reason.</p>
<hr />
<p>At a certain level, the war helped US. But we cannot forget the
meaninglessness of the surrounding zeitgeist that led those young kids
on that battlefield. Nothing is sacred.</p>

<p>Actually at gov level when officials say "we will support a multitude of approaches (bev and fcev)", that helps us. It guarantees an even playing field, and in such a field we will bust a cap in their ass. </p>
<p>Juz sayin at pers level I dont have to repeat that line. Gov is their biz</p>
<p>IEA, same way. </p>
<p>I'd like to see them disregard some <em>really</em> bad solutions tho, like nuclear.</p>

<p>Actually it's not surprising physics community fell into that String Theory trap. Witten, the guy who died.. what's his face, something something dash something, all went in, head-first into this thing, and these guys were bright young stars of their generation.</p>
<p>ST got them at a critical time, and got them good. These ppl also influence many in their field who were led astray by them. It's sad really. After 40 some years and nothing to show for it, Witten still can't let it go. A mass delusion at a scale probably unseen in science.</p>
