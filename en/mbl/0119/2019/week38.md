More replies to the post below;

"@Karlmarxhd

When I started learning about Canadian politics, I leaned
liberal. Then I've learned about Tommy Douglas and started leaning
towards the NDP.

As soon as I ran into the #COMER issue and found out that the NDP is
the only party who had monetary reform in their platform, my support
pretty much cemented.  Then, Bernie happened and I became a socialist.

@cdchambs

Raised religious center-right in Idaho. Didn't realize I was a
conservative until college in Washington. Changing my politics and
faith were intertwined: hated Sarah Palin and wondered if my
disagreement with her politics meant I couldn't be a Christian
anymore. /1 profs at my Christian college modeled how progressive
politics and compassion-based faith could fuel each other. I was
sold. So grateful for the transformation.

@PhelanSnow

Grew up with Christian conservative grandparents but saw the effects
of conservative policies on my heavily impoverished mother. Soon as I
could vote, I did, and it sure as hell wasn't for conservatives.

@CindyMumz

Ultra right-wing mom had us listen to Nazi recorded messages. A

moved to progressive Columbia Md and got exposed to a more diverse

SR's value on itw own is useful too; positive, the greater the
better. People usually seek values close to 1.0. If, per unit
volatility (risk), the average return is close to 1.0, that would be a
preferable asset.

---

Man speaka the truth. Here is a SR demo on one piece of a recent
slowdown.

Sharpe Ratio calculates asset (stock, bond) returns in volatility
(risk) terms. I could hold bonds at certain volatility and earn, hold
stock at higher volatility and earn. At higher risk you'd expect
better return, but how do you compare? For SR we divide both returns
by vol so we can compare apples to apples.

"A Lunar Space Elevator Is Actually Feasible & Inexpensive, Scientists Find...

The concept of a moon elevator isn’t new...But the Columbia study
differs from previous proposal in an important way: instead of
building the elevator from the Earth’s surface (which is impossible
with today’s technology), it would be anchored on the moon and stretch
some 200,000 miles toward Earth until hitting the geostationary orbit
height (about 22,236 miles above sea level), at which objects move
around Earth in lockstep with the planet’s own rotation.

Dangling the space elevator at this height would eliminate the need to
place a large counterweight near Earth’s orbit to balance out the
planet’s massive gravitational pull if the elevator were to be built
from ground up"

Brutal.

Voit writes a blog called *Not Even Wrong*; the name is a dig into
String Theory, because a theory must be falsifiable, you can't twist
and bend with every experiment ("well it could say that too"), you
have to take a stand and either be right or wrong, but ST is none of
these things. The theory is "not even wrong", because it doesn't say
anything.

stupidity. Those in the physics and science communication communities
who care about the public understanding of quantum mechanics should
think hard about what they can do to deal with this situation. They
may however come to the same conclusion I’ve just reached: best to

"The neoliberal revolution that has been underway since the mid-1970s
fundamentally reoriented American governance toward the interests of
capital. While the distance between government and the so-called
private sector was never that great, all pretense that government
served the broader public interest was cast aside in favor of
state-corporatism. This wasn’t simply a matter of privatizing the
public realm— it overlaid a capitalist rationale on all public
undertakings.

This re-conceptualization of the public purpose turned state functions
into profit making opportunities for private interests. Defense of the
realm became producing, selling and deploying arms for profit. Public
education, already variably and poorly funded, was redefined using
bogus metrics to be bled dry by private corporations. American health
care, the most expensive in the world with close to the worst health
outcomes, now funds a parasite class of multi-millionaire health
insurance executives...

Whether the result of naivete, ideological blinders, ignorance of
history or cynical calculation, for four-plus decades the view has
been that the public interest is best served by private interests. And
while political spectacle has been concentrated in and around the
presidency, neoliberal ideology and practice have been instantiated at
every level of government. While this facilitates capital-friendly
policies, it creates a near impenetrable barrier to challenging rule
by capital.

As plausible as accidental history is in many realms, this isn’t the
case with the instantiation of neoliberal state-corporatism. From the
think tanks funded by rich capitalist ideologues in the 1960s and
1970s, neoliberalism has been programmatically embedded into every
nook and cranny of American governance. Engineered so that nothing
short of wholesale insurrection can dislodge it, this is exactly what
the resulting maldistribution and social dysfunction are now making
inevitable.

With the background problems of environmental crisis, unhinged
militarism and political economy that long ago ran off the rails, the
upcoming presidential election offers the potential to be significant
for the first time in decades. With Bernie Sanders in the running, the
choice is no longer just between figureheads who front for capital and
the oligarchs, but between said figureheads and a fundamental
realignment of political priorities back toward the public interest.

This is to grant a lot to Mr. Sanders and the broader context of
American politics. Partly as a result of the pre-neoliberal age in
which he spent his early years and partly through a moral compass
centered on the public interest, Mr. Sanders alone amongst modern
presidential candidates is capable of expanding the idea of the public
interest to include the large swath of the U.S.— and importantly,
outside of it, whose economic fortunes were cast asunder through
neoliberal reforms and plunder"

terms of the jobs that they actually hold: raising [or complementing]
the salaries of restaurant workers barely able to feed their families;
providing paid leave for child-care providers who cannot care for
their own children; securing benefits [for healthcare M4A] for
warehouse workers who lack insurance because they are employed as
contractors"

"Much like the Fed, as some would say, Jim Cramer has a dual mandate:
to entertain and to pump up the markets. He is certainly excellent as
an entertainer. But this morning on CNBC’s 'Squawk Box' he let bleed
through just how concerned he is about the stock market that is
teetering at the top to such an extent that a single, messy, overhyped
company going public will 'screw up' the entire market"

A new report from the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on
Energy seeks to assess the signs of whether there will be a gradual or
a rapid “energy transition.”  In other words, will global economies
switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies slowly or all at once?
... However, the report omits a crucial piece of technological
development from its forecast: batteries.

The few times batteries are mentioned, they are generally referred to
as “storage,” because batteries are essentially just storage
containers for electricity or power. The report draws conclusion like,
'Even as penetration [of renewable power] rises, technologies such as
storage and demand response are likely to make higher levels of
penetration cheaper'. This is serious flaw with the conclusions and
forecasts because we do not yet have that technology to make better
and cheaper batteries, and we don’t know when or if we will.

"Boeing used its political connections to monopolize the American
aerospace industry and corrupt its regulators. In the 1990s, Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas merged, leaving America with just one major
producer of civilian aircraft. Before this merger, when there was a
competitive market, Boeing was a wonderful company. As journalist
Jerry Useem put it just 20 years ago, 'Boeing has always been less a
business than an association of engineers devoted to building amazing
flying machines'"

This all comes form a moronic need to fight orange Hitler. You don't
have to do _anything_. In its own pace things were improving
already. But that's not the real problem is it? The real problem is
the top 20%, corporatists / centrists Democrats need these issues to
reaffirm their political status which does not care about economics
anymore, and this sorry excuse of "social policy" is all they have
left. Said approach not only does not work, it triggers an adverse
reaction on the other side.

From Appelbaum earlier: "A dominant company might provide the best
service at the lowest price, but economic efficiency was not the goal
of public policy. In 1962, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that
the Brown Shoe Company could not buy the G. R. Kinney Company because
the deal would let the combined company sell shoes at lower prices,
and that would place its smaller competitors at a disadvantage”".

The ruling is still about economic efficiency actually; the difference
is on what timeframe... If we let competition die for "better
service", we might get somewhat of an efficiency immediately, but
would lose long term efficiency later. After the competition is wiped
out, there'll be less innovation, and the dominant company might even
raise prices because they are not threatened by others anymore.

Catholicism is paganized faux-Christianity

"Prior to the time of [Roman emperor] Constantine's "conversion,"
Christians were persecuted not so much for their profession of faith
in Christ, but because they would not include pagan deities in their
faith as well. Then, with Constantine's emphasis on making his
new-found Christianity palatable to the heathen in the Empire, the
"Christianization" of these pagan deities was facilitated. For
example, pagan rituals and idols gradually took on Christian meanings
and names and were incorporated into "Christian" worship (e.g.,
"saints" replaced the cult of pagan gods in both worship and as
patrons of cities; mother/son statues were renamed Mary and Jesus;
etc.), and pagan holidays were reclassified as Christian holy days
(e.g., the Roman Lupercalia and the feast of purification of Isis
became the Feast of the Nativity; the Saturnalia celebrations were
replaced by Christmas celebrations; an ancient festival of the dead
was replaced by All Souls Day, rededicated to Christian heroes [now
Halloween]; etc.). A transition had occurred – instead of being
persecuted for failure to worship pagan deities, Christians who did
not agree with the particular orthodoxy backed by the Emperor were now
persecuted in the name of Christ! "Christianized" Rome had become the
legitimate successor of pagan Rome! This is the sad origin of the
Roman Catholic Church as it compromised from the very beginning

"ECB governors representing the top European economies defied Mario
Draghi’s ultimately successful bid to restart quantitative easing,
according to officials with knowledge of the matter.

>The unprecedented revolt took place during a fractious meeting where
 Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau joined more
 traditional hawks including his Dutch colleague Klaas Knot and
 Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann in pressing against an immediate
 resumption of bond purchases, the people said. They spoke on
 condition of anonymity, because such discussions are confidential.

>Those three governors alone represent roughly half of the euro region
 as measured by economic output and population. Other dissenters
 included, but weren’t limited, to their colleagues from Austria and
 Estonia, as well as members on the ECB’s Executive Board including
 Sabine Lautenschlaeger and the markets chief, Benoit Coeure, the
 officials said"
