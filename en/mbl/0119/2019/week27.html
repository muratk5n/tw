<p>He's got that all wrong. Banks print money while giving credit, no
need for "savings". If u print money for speculation, that creates
bubbles. If comps are not overlevered, they are not blocked in their
inno, they go get credit and produce "good growth".</p>
<p>"Summers: [T]his may all be madness, and I may not have this right at all.” But in light of the data, the question had to be put: What if the inadequate recovery was not simply down to policy failure? What if there was a deeper problem, a chronic shortfall in the demand for investment relative to the supply of savings, resulting in a sustained condition of “secular stagnation”?</p>
<p>To see the force of this argument, Summers invited his surprised audience to look back to the period before the crash. In retrospect, everyone agreed that monetary policy before 2008 had been “too easy. . . . [T]here was a vast amount of imprudent lending going on. Almost everybody believes that wealth, as it was experienced by households, was in excess of its reality. Too easy money, too much borrowing, too much wealth.” But if that were the case, one would have expected the American economy to have been on a dramatic bull run. It was not. Despite the excesses of the housing boom, growth up to 2008 had been average" <em>Crashed</em></p>

capitalism remade itself in a more concentrated and monopolistic

<p>Bernie made the best case for himself with the closing statement. If
things have been going wrong for 40 yrs, u need to vote for the guy

<p>"South African telecoms companies are hit by higher operating costs
whenever load-shedding strikes. GenCell CEO Rami Reshef has argued
that using hydrogen as a backup energy solution has the potential to
greatly reduce the impact.</p>
<p>The company uses technology to generate hydrogen cheaply from
ammonia. Reshef says that the price of ammonia is half or even a third
of the equivalent weight of diesel, and that a business could use his
solution to have enough power for several days. A report published by
Rethink Technology and GenCell in 2018 estimated that a mobile
operator in South Africa implementing the GenCell backup product on
1,000 of its sites could save $200m over ten years compared with
diesel. Reshef says he is in negotiations with several mobile
operators in South Africa."</p>
