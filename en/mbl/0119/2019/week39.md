That's true. Incentives, rules define outcome. Dems allowed private interests have free reign, and when these ppl do what they do, some complain. 
Do not "implore" ppl for the right behaviour. Want different outcomes? Change the game.

BJ is a *Control Freak*, and this is what the world around does to
them when they are messing up. I feel like his pro-Brexitness has
something to do with his own issues around control too. CF phsychology
is that of a monk who lived in a convent all his life, then all of a
sudden *gets out*. They controlled all their emo, lived with
*discipline*, now they are out in a world of lots of choice. Their
path is to deal with that, cant go back to convent, cant control, wont
like being controlled, etc.

The problem is EU is not your fucking convent BJ. Whatever odd feels u
associate with this org are unfounded.

Sure, I know a lot of them actually.. my good friend from college, a
Greek guy, is this type. Whenever he goes to a beach, he finds the
nearest small hill, and does a dive from that hilltop into the
sea. It's a thing he always does, now he has his kids do it with
him. So this is in some ways JDINM positive; not overthinking
something, just doing it.

Taking medical advice from doctor, or legal advice form lawyer is not
a form of "hierarchy". It is utilizing someone else's knowledge, like
reading a book. Ideally these are automated of course, but until then,
and with society broken up into such "guilds", it is what it is.
