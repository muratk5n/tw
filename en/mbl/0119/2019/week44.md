Trump is now telling British voters (who he needs to support Brexit so
he can do a UK deal) that he's not after our NHS.

But he's telling his own voters (who he needs to elect him next year)
he'll make our NHS pay more for medicines"

I liked the old/new mov on its own... it's no T2 but watchable. Davis
is a fine lead.

Just watched the Herminator. It is basically a reboot sold as
continuation, and a different movie using all parts of the old, with
the same general outline. So odd.. My first thought was why not create
a new storyline with new characters, and finish the T2 storyline as
is? Fight with Skynet, humanity wins. The end.

Rethinking the Role of Banks in Economics Education by Keen.

equations those diagrams are based on. Econs, check it out.

other customers". What a douche.

Supermarkets may not make money by selling bread either (low margins,
maybe), but customers would want it, and they'd buy many other things
while they are in the store. I don't pay attn to these atomic,

Twitter bans political ads. That is their prerogative.

Allowing ads and not filtering, or no ads.

I am a sucker for bios. I use them and ppl in them as filters, as
examplars for a time, a concept, a certain way of living. If you have
SocDyn gene you can build from there. I focus on dividing
characteristics the most, the attribute that creates most
contrast. Like in Jesse Ventura's bio *I Ain't Got Time to Bleed*,

>I might have gone a lot further in Hollywood if I had been willing to
move there.  At one point Arnold Schwarzenegger asked me when I was
going to move out there and become one of the boys. I said, “Well,
what about the schools?”  Arnold replied, “Don’t worry about the
schools. You put your kids in private school.”  That’s what stopped
me. I thought, “I’m not living in a place where my kids have to go to
private school.” I’m not knocking private schools, but I believe that
I owe it to my kids to let them grow up in a place where private
school isn’t required.

This was filed away in my head \>20 yrs ago. Why? It shows a hard-core
left position for someone you might not expect it from (big, brusque,
media guy), it shows clear contrast with some1 from Europe (a place
more left than US), who did not care, so on.

---

No need for anything magical as explanation.. IMO it is the law of
averages. We all know the average, conciously or subconsiously, on
many types of behaviours. Say risk taking, listening,
controlling.. Then we see ppl who are worse than average on these
things, a small fraction of the soc in large for each type, and we act
accordingly, automatically pushing ppl to where they need to be.

"U say sometimes it looks as if everyone conspires to push people in
their development path. How is that possible?"

Snowden, *Permanent Record*

"The NSA described XKEYSCORE, in the documents I’d later pass on to
journalists, as its “widest-ranging” tool, used to search “nearly
everything a user does on the Internet.” The technical specs I studied
went into more detail as to how exactly this was accomplished—by
“packetizing” and “sessionizing,” or cutting up the data of a user’s
online sessions into manageable packets for analysis—but nothing could
prepare me for seeing it in action.

It was, simply put, the closest thing to science fiction I’ve ever
seen in science fact: an interface that allows you to type in pretty
much anyone’s address, telephone number, or IP address, and then
basically go through the recent history of their online activity. In
some cases you could even play back recordings of their online
sessions, so that the screen you’d be looking at was their screen,
whatever was on their desktop. You could read their emails, their
browser history, their search history, their social media postings,
everything [..]

I didn’t type the names of the agency director or the president into
XKEYSCORE, but after enough time with the system I realized I could
have. Everyone’s communications were in the system—everyone’s. I was
initially fearful that if I searched those in the uppermost echelons
of state, I’d be caught and fired, or worse. But it was surpassingly
simple to disguise a query regarding even the most prominent figure by
encoding my search terms in a machine format that looked like
gibberish to humans but would be perfectly understandable to
XKEYSCORE"

"Today ... brings a bumper crop of the highest quality, with new
examples from a few of the world’s most prominent theoretical
physicists. Today’s hype neatly exemplifies the two main current
genres of hype about string theory and supposed new fundamental
physics. The first is the old-school genre of string theory hype we’ve
now been seeing for 35 years: “string theory makes a testable
prediction” (no, it doesn’t). The second is the new, post-modern
variety: no actual theory, just a grandiose claim that space and time
have been replaced, although it’s unclear by what" -- Voit

Late-stage capitalism... It's not just robbing ppl blind, it is now
actively killing you.

In terms of technology: electrification needs to take a backseat, wire
based tech needs to be abandoned. Transmission of energy should be
based on renewable-gas through pipes underground.

And also, yes, this utility needs to be "municipalized".

everyone kept using it. Sort of like now I guess.

E.T. existence is not unlikely. I could not disprove it easily from

I follow Steven Greer sometimes (the UFOlogist), and about some event
he'll say "the E.T. will not allow it!". This one topic was about
nukes in space, apparently we tried to put nukes there, E.T. destroyed
it. So they don't allow nukes in space.

Now I find myself trying to figure out the politics of E.T. What would
they be for? Would they be for tax cuts? Or against tax cuts?  They
are not climate skeptics apparently (so says SG). I think there is
more mystery here than the E.T.

We need more alternation between true left and right - instead of
going between Mush \#1, Mush \#2, etc.. True left brings healthcare if
missing, true right can deregulate if too much, it goes on.. Mush
provides no selection. It's policy positions are a mush; a little bit
of everything, which means nothing. Same shit policies with different
faces. That is exactly how we got here.

Snowden, *Permanent Record*

"On Constitution Day 2012, I picked up the document in earnest... I
read through it in its entirety, from the Articles to the
Amendments. I was surprised to be reminded that fully 50 percent of
the Bill of Rights, the document’s first ten amendments, were intended
to make the job of law enforcement harder. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
Seventh, and Eighth Amendments were all deliberately, carefully
designed to create inefficiencies and hamper the government’s ability
to exercise its power and conduct surveillance...

In fact, many of the rights ... aren’t even provided for in law except
by implication. They exist in that open-ended empty space created
through the restriction of government power. For example, Americans
only have a “right” to free speech because the government is forbidden
from making any law restricting that freedom, and a “right” to a free
press because the government is forbidden from making any law to
abridge it. They only have a “right” to worship freely because the
government is forbidden from making any law respecting an
establishment of religion, and a “right” to peaceably assemble and
protest because the government is forbidden from making any law that
says they can’t"

Warren team's fake ad on Facebook is tactical move, throwing red meat
to centrists who are the most feverish anti-Trumpers. I dont agree
with it (political ads should not be filtered), but it can be
effective for Warren. This is how playing the game looks like. It's
ugly.

"There is really an enormous number of problems where derivatives are
unavailable but one has imperative practical reasons for wanting to do
some optimization. It is almost a natural perversity that practical
problems today are often complex, nonlinear, and not sufficiently
explicitly defined to give reliable derivatives. Indeed, such problems
were always numerous, but, 30 years ago, when nonlinear optimization
techniques were relatively more naive than they are today, even the
most optimistic practitioners would not try to optimize such complex
problems." \#introDerivativeFreeOpt

That's funny - someone created a Git repo for the US constitution and
committed changes to the repo in the same order the changes were made
to the USC.

It'd even be better if he set the date back to orig date. 

Can I make a pull-request now? :) Imagine law being made this way.
