I remember the Kal-ee-fornia recall election run and the Ahnuld
campaign. He probably started out with consultants, slicing and dicing
"issues" (do this, u get 3.4%, do that u get %6, ..., add it up, we
win). I got this inkling bcz at some pt he said something abt the
"Armenian issue", and TR corporate media started shitting their pants,
this is when I heard. It's a good to issue to defend, but seriously,
WTF would Ahnuld know abt the Armenian issue. I bet some consult
weasel fakk said, "do this u get %1.5".

But I think governator later on saw this appr wouldn't work him, he
changed tack. He became ultra-pro green. Now that sells - a
Republican, very green, you stand out. It's an issue you can lead on, so
you look like a stand-up person.

Issues are not important on their own per se, especially when u r the
challenger. They need to contribute to your *character* which is.

And character needs to be part oaf + not crass + leader + relatable +
part cool. See urself as these, so ppl will see it that way too.

Be it. Know it.

Authenticity, good. It will sell (not that Bernie does it 4 that

"@NickKristof

I admire the fact that @SenSanders speaks up for the Palestinians. I
suspect that this costs him votes every time he does it, and yet he
brings it up regularly. It's like his concern for the crisis in Yemen
-- no votes in it, but a sign of values and authenticity"

That's how ppl flew during 50s. In luxury, essentially in a metal can
hurling through air >500 miles/hr. If you can do that during 50s, u
can bet your ass u can do the moon landing during 60s.

A possible Nano fork which creates money in everyone's account
monthly/annually will get us the best of both worlds. It won't be
deflationary (like gold, Bitcoin), it will inflate away some wealth if
some are sitting on money for too long and it will spur spending,
create economic activity for the same reason. Also it gives money to
everyone, supplying a basic income electronically as a human right.

How did I come up with the interval analysis for the "dollar strong"
argument? We hear finance types say such things, dollar is strong,
then weak, etc. I dont believe a single word these f--ers say. Strong?
What does that mean? Relative to what?

Probably some historical average. Weak and strong would then be a
band, based on an interval of historical prices. How to construct such
an interval? Compute mean and standard deviation, mean - stdev, mean +
stdev gives a lower/higher band. About 68% of historical data points
fall here. 2 stdev below and above would get you 95%. If curr price is
closer to upper band, dollar is strong, close to lower, it is weak.

But dont believe me either - when someone says 68%, or 95%, how did
they come up with that? How do we derive it?

If prices are assumed to be normally distributed then we think of the
area around mean (data comes from, falls in that region), between
stdev to the left, and right. If any normal dist can be reduced to
standard normal dist N(0,1), the area is

```python
from scipy.stats.distributions import norm
np.round(norm.cdf(1)-norm.cdf(-1),2)*100
```

```text
Out[1]: 68.0
```

And

```python
np.round(norm.cdf(2)-norm.cdf(-2),2)*100
```

```text
Out[1]: 95.0
```

Now we know for sure

"California Governor Gavin Newsom rushed to defend wine caves, the
underground cellars where vintners can age wine in cool, dry
surroundings and host their fancy friends. Newsom happens to own a
wine cave, and he noted that the one where the Buttigieg event was
held is regularly used for Democratic Party fundraisers. Its owners,
Craig and Kathryn Hall, are longtime party donors; Kathryn was an
ambassador to Austria under President Bill Clinton. This battle might
be about money in progressive politics, but it’s also part of a much
larger war over American wealth, fought in part because of what the
internet has illuminated about the nation’s inequality" -- The Atlantic

"[Contains spoilers] Nothing stays put in The Rise of
Skywalker. J. J. Abrams, the director and one of the co-writers, picks
up and ditches intriguing concepts so capriciously that viewers are
left feeling as if they’ve watched someone sneeze on all the items at
a fabulous buffet. This approach—which is “for want of a better word,
completely manic,” my colleague David Sims wrote—is a big part of the
negative critical reaction to the movie. But the wasteful use of
settings, doodads, characters, and space horses does not just exhaust
the audience. It also undermines the most essential prerogative of
Star Wars: world-building.

Lucas’s original trilogy didn’t fret all that much about having a
clever plot. The arc from A New Hope to Return of the Jedi was a
relatively clean and straightforward one about good guys struggling to
overthrow bad ones, with limited detours to explore the consequential
backstory of the main hero and main villain. Upon this sturdy spine,
Lucas and his team draped exquisite set pieces set in interesting
locations. The characters lingered in snow bases and treetop
villages. The journey was absolutely as important as the destination" -- The Atlantic

"@AssaadRazzouk

Something very big happened in the Netherlands recently and it will
have a ripple effect in Courts around the world: The Netherlands’
Supreme Court upheld a ruling ordering the country’s government to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by the end of 2020

The Dutch Supreme Court affirmed that Government's care is directed at
'keeping the country habitable and protecting and improving the
environment',

Even 'if the State itself is not the cause of all Dutch greenhouse gas
emissions',

Even 'if Dutch emissions of greenhouse gases in absolute terms,
compared to global emissions, are very low',

Even 'if the State cannot solve the emissions problem on its own',

... The State should, from its own territory, take measures to the
best of its ability that, together with the efforts of other States,
offer protection against the dangers of serious climate change.

So: The limited partial responsibility of the Dutch State in relation
to the global climate problem does not relieve the State of the duty
of care it bears: The government had explicit duties to protect its
citizens’ human rights in the face of climate change"

"In Libya, where dozens of rival militias have been fighting for

While Italy backs the Government of National Accord (GNA) of Fayez

France has sided with the National Army of Libya (LNA) of Field
Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who presides over its counterpart in

People are better at judging people than policy, but even that fails
sometimes. So ppl judge a person based on guess who's thinking?

That's right - their own. That same person's idea of themselves. 

"People will see you as u see yourself" is an old chestnut but it is
true, especially in politics. So when attacked u need to attack back,
because, "pfff of *course* there is nothing wrong with me".

This is the game - mostly about how things look.
