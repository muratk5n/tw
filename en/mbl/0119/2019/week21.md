On the scifi show Continuum there was the talk of a Corporate Congress
in the future. I was like ha ha that's some funny shit! Awesome
fiction man! This was before realizing what US Democrats had
become. Reps u sorta expect, but them too? Sad.

"Many of those tests didn’t approach the required 275 miles, usually ending somewhere in the low 200-mile range, as the range report from IndyGo reveals. On one frigid day, range was limited to 152 miles. 1/3"

Is Biden truly the frontrunner? From the way MSM is trying to trash Bernie it doesnt seem so..

"Europe has started to build world’s largest power plant: 180 GW of offshore wind capacity, dwarfing China’s Three Gorges Dam (22.5 GW)! 
13 GW is already in operation and ~50 GW will be completed by 2030."

Google Pay really needs to become a payment processor.

Flask-User for user management. Looks good. 

They have one example where everything 4 the demo is in one file. Simple. Keeping track of a sprawling file list sucks while playing with new tech.

"Comet inspires chemistry for making breathable oxygen on Mars"

Fascinating. Hit the CO2 hard enough it emits O2.

String Theorist, dead. TSLA, down. May, out. Not bad, considering.

"It was particularly important because it was the last major summary of where physics was on the eve of the string revolution where, in my opinion, it picked a path to nowhere.

Murray’s summary was the thing that happened just before the fateful decision to bet it all on Strings."

Ah Tom Fried also made an anti-China turn on the recent trade
stuff.. I saw him with Cuckbart on TV he was like "I agree with him
wholeheartedly". Wasnt this guy 90s, work-work-work pro-Hillary
flat-earther (as in a globosapien)?

Yes

"May [..] was trapped less by her personal flaws than by the structural flaw within Brexit itself"

The only possible "decisive" Brexit deal is a no-deal Brexit. I cant stress enough how nonchalant the EU is on a UK leave. Juncker was like "if you want to leave, leave. If you want to stay, stay". It is comical really.

"May paves way for more decisive Brexit deal"

Yey. 

But to be fair none of the latest shit show is her fault. Cameron is the one who dropped the ball. 

She was brought in to do a job, which turned out to be impossible (well some knew it was but cons found out too)

"Britain's May says she will step down on June 7"

Biden talked out of his ass in earlier tries but then he was having fun then. He isnt now, he looks more focused, serious. Which can be a problem. He came clean for bunch of stuff in the beginning, which can only be the result of a staff brainstorm "what are our weaknesses"

.. so the operation looks more disciplined. 

His profile is Mellow Meadow. 

In the negative, yes, they are sleepy. 

Substance abuse can be a problem 4 some even.

Some were arguing ML belongs under CS. It probably should go under Statistics. That's what it is; fitting a general purpose model, determining weights. Stats has linear ones, some non-linear, ML, "AI" has highly non-linear ones but still with weights.

They set this up all nice and easy for Trump (at least on paper). Iraq, Afganistan invasions themselves helped surround Iran, the next invasion. Judging by the Mr Mustache appointment DJT probably isnt too disinterested in regime change himself.

Add to that racheting up oil import restrictions, this is moving towards some kind of change.
