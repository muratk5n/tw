<p>Yes the contrast is clear; in US the oil industry produced an
innovator like JDR, in many other places it fueled tyrannical regimes
with zero innovation like in [fill in the blanks]. Sad.</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually that stuff, plus pipelines etc came later. JDR was primarily
a refiner. He built an enourmous expertise around engineering,
processing, and basically managing a tech company. He is also AFAIK
the only person who made more money after retirement than before
retirement because when he built the biz, oil was for heating, lamps.
Then cars came to the scene, the profits of his businesses (and the
value of the stocks he still held after retirement)
exploded (see the bio <em>Titan</em>).</p>

becomes so successful the business eventually gets broken up!</p>
