<p>"Up until now small variations in the current passing through a memristor device was not precise enough for numerical calculations. The Nanoelectronics group, University of Michigan, got around this problem by digitizing the current outputs—defining current ranges as specific bit values (i.e., 0 or 1). The team was also able to map large mathematical problems into smaller blocks within the array, improving the efficiency and flexibility of the system.</p>

<p>You bury the left, you end up with worse. </p>
<p>"But the bottom line is this: Miliband came not to bury capitalism,
but to save it. He offered Britain a smidgen of basic social
democracy, the smallest taste of redistribution: curbing zero-hours
contracts and the vast power imbalance between bosses and workers; the
privatisation of natural monopolies and the rotting away of the public
realm. By dismissing that argument, the establishment in effect sent
out one unified message to voters mired in a slump: that post-crash
Britain was unreformed and unreformable. That argument was to be used
against the elites with deadly effect in the EU referendum of 2016."</p>
<hr />
<p>There is this framing of the left that they cannot manage things; but
somehow cons f#$k shit up much badly and irreversibly than anyone in
the mainstream left.</p>
<p>"So much has changed this decade that it seems absurd to consider how
at its start, in 2010, a 40-year-old father of two and whiz on a
Rubik’s Cube was considered the biggest threat to the British
establishment. Did that really happen? Yes, confirm the archives. He
was Red Ed, a “Marxoid creep” (the Daily Mail, of course), the man
with the sneaky plan to turn the country into some socialist banana
republic.</p>
<p>How laughably tinny such jibes sound today. Seen in the rearview
mirror of a country hurtling towards a cliff-edge, undeterred by
Whitehall warnings of shortages in medicine, fuel and food, the
Miliband era looks enviable. You could quarrel and quibble with the
man, of course; you could pick holes all day long. But knowing what
was to come, how the next couple of episodes were to play out, would
you still have gone for the chillaxing blunderer [Cameron] who landed
us in a historic mess then grabbed the thick end of a million quid
from some poor sap of a publisher to stick his trotters up in a
£25,000 shed and yawn out a memoir?"</p>

<p>"But [Einstein's] revolution was not finished. The standard model of particle physics was certainly the triumph of this pragmatic style of
doing physics, but its triumph seems now to have also marked its limit. The standard model, and just possibly inflation, is about as far
as we could go with normal science. Since then, we have been mired, because what we need is a return to a revolutionary kind of science. Once again, we need a few seers. The problem is that there are now very few around, as a result of science having been done so long in a way that rarely recognized and barely tolerated them.
Between the early twentieth century and the last quarter century, science — and the academy in general — has become much more organized and professionalized. This means that the practice of 
normal science has been enshrined as the single model of good science. Even if everyone can see that a revolution is necessary, the most
powerful parts of our community have forgotten how to make one."</p>

<p>I listen to Brit cons talk abt Corbyn, their tone is always in a
manner painting C as unacceptable, even unconcienable as a choice for

hope they end up eating those words.</p>

<p>That's the other crazy thing abt ST; u can have an obscene number of
them, all seperate versions. So what Feynman said abt ST in 80s still
applies today; the theory itself should tell u how many dimensions
there are, which version is the correct one. But it doesn't.</p>

<p>"At the beginning of the first superstring revolution, it was
miraculous that any string theory existed at all. That there were
eventually five was even more surprising. The sheer improbability
cemented our belief in the project. If at first it was unlikely to
work and then it did work—well, this was nothing less than
wonderful. Today string theorists are ready to accept the existence of
a landscape containing a vast number of theories, based on much less
evidence than we needed twenty years ago to convince ourselves that a
single theory existed.So one place to draw the line is simply to say,
'I need to be persuaded that these theories exist, using the same
standards that were required decades ago to evaluate the original
five.' If you insist on those standards, then you will not believe in
the vast number of new theories" --Smolin</p>

<p>"German theoretical physicist Olaf Dreyer, who argues that the
incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity can be
resolved only if we give up the idea that space is fundamental. He
proposes that space itself emerges from a more fundamental description
that is quite different. This point of view is also argued by several
theorists who did great work in the field of condensed-matter physics,
such as the Nobel laureate Robert Laughlin and the Russian physicist
Grigori Volovik" -- Smolin.</p>

<p>String Theory was thought to be a "theory of everything" then it

<p>ha ha.. Apparently some fixes were made for this problem during 90s,
but then things became even hairier.</p>
<p>"String Theory initially proposed to unify all the particles and
forces in nature. But as it was studied in the decade following the
1984 revolution, something unexpected happened. The alleged unified
theory fractured into many different theories: the five consistent
superstring theories in ten-dimensional spacetime, plus millions of
variants in the cases where some dimensions were wrapped up. As time
went on, it became clear that string theory itself was in need of
unification" -- Smolin</p>

<p>A story on phycist Edward Teller: at the start of the semester, 1st
class, he is talking abt administrative details, points to his TA,
says "this is my TA John, his room number is .. what was it John..?
(TA says 120).. okay, you divide by 2, and add 5, mine is 65. </p>
<p>You see, I can't remember but I can derive".</p>
<p>Story relayed by another physicist who was a grad student then, who
says he learned an important lesson that day, how deriving can
actually help you remember. Surely Teller was being somewhat
tongue-in-cheek about it, but this does reflect how good scientists
think. U need to be able to derive from first principles. It will help
you not only understand, also to remember, by deriving it if
necessary. Oh I forgot "integration by parts". Well.. did you know IBP
formula is just an expanded, rearranged form of d(f(t)g(t))/dt?</p>

<p>Fractional reserve theory is false. See
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070">here</a>.
Article says "According to the financial intermediation theory of
banking, banks are merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial
institutions, collecting deposits that are then lent out. According to
the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere
financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively
they end up creating money through systemic interaction. A third
theory maintains that each individual bank has the power to create
money ‘out of nothing’ and does so when it extends credit (the credit
creation theory of banking)."</p>
