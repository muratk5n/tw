<p>BdM found democracies not only are richer, but also fight better;
because for fear of losing an election, democracies must mobilize
fast, in bigger numbers, which increases their chances of
victory. Non-democracy regimes could hide their losses, the real
situation, perhaps allowing a wrong direction to persist longer than
necessary. </p>

<p>Some can ignore the parts of that explanation. It should be up to
them. But as a rule every disussion of divergence needs to explain
where it comes from.</p>

<p>Sure - but this was self-reliance in a world of game, wide open nature
(all is public space, no ownership of land); This was the 0th Wave,
the thing before everything else. The longest we've been anything,
we've been that.</p>
<p>Hunting could be hard, but also can be done in spurts. This is how we
are wired, for sprints, not marathons (marathon is for sheep lovers,
peasants, back-breaking routine work).</p>
<p>1st, 2nd waves took that land, divided up the society into little
chunks, food production, material production, schools, prisons, now
you created a completely different environment where you actually
cannot be self-reliant. Some ppl will fall through the cracks no
matter what you do, and they will not be happy.</p>
<p>You could say "evolution would naturally select behaviours optimal for
each age", I am usually a sucker for that kind of argument, but each
of these eras are shorter and stupider than the last. Agro era 12K
years, industrial era 300. Then there'll be space soon (the 4th Wave),
so... this is bunch of non-sense. Let's rearrange stuff for
non-scarcity, mobility, availability of wide public services and land,
this will handle most problems.</p>
<p>"But if left is based on pre-agro forager, that's all abt
self-reliance!"</p>
<hr />
<p>The right keeps framing inequality issues around "I worked hard and
earned that money", looking at only at one slice of the system, the
"earning" (the culture code for money in US is PROOF). Before u ended
up with that money, there were crediting policy who got you, or your
employer that credit, ed level (now heavily tied to parent's ed
status) who preferred one person over another for that job, taxes that
took less than it should have so u ended up with that dough. If all
parts of the system were hunky-dory, then you could allow that last
slice of the system, "earning the money" be as it is. But it isn't.</p>
<p>It's like the healthcare debate; if drug makers, insurers were
benevolent, u'd spend less. But they are not benevolent. So gov needs
to bash their skull to get to Walhalla. U use the unideal to fix the
unequal to reach optimal.</p>
<p>Another thing they miss is you are not helping "others", you are
helping yourself. Do we want sick people all over the place getting
others sick, bringing the morale down? Or showing up with pitchforks
at your house? </p>

<p>"What I believe is failing is not so much a particular theory but a
style of doing science that was well suited to the problems we faced
in the middle part of the twentieth century but is ill suited to the
kinds of fundamental problems we face now. The standard model of
particle physics was the triumph of a particular way of doing science
that came to dominate physics in the 1940s. This style is pragmatic
and hard-nosed and favors virtuosity in calculating over reflection on
hard conceptual problems. This is profoundly different from the way
that Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin
Schrodinger, and the other early-twentieth-century evolutionaries did
science. Their work arose from deep thought on the most basic
questions surrounding space, time, and matter, and they saw what they
did as part of a broader philosophical tradition, in which they were
at home.</p>
<p>In the approach to particle physics developed and taught by Richard
Feynman, Freeman Dyson, and others, reflection on foundational
problems had no place in research. This freed them from the debates
over the meaning of quantum physics that their elders were embroiled
in and led to thirty years of dramatic progress. This is as it should
be: Different styles of research are needed to solve different kinds
of problems. Working out the applications of established frameworks
requires very different kinds of thinking — and thinkers — than
inventing those frameworks in the first place.</p>
<p>However, as I will argue in detail in the pages to come, the lesson of
the last thirty years is that the problems we're up against today
cannot be solved by this pragmatic way of doing science".</p>

problem has to be to give Isaac F---ing Newton a headache? That was

<p>It's also very likely Dem establishment carefully made sure it was
non-white progressives that joined its ranks recently, not whites, bcz
they wanted the opposition to Trump be in racial terms, that to take
center stage along with immigration they were hoping (it worked),
instead of economics, and left. The hired dogs in the media smelled
this too, and give them huge media time mostly from that angle. There
are some good ppl among these progs, but sadly they are being used.</p>

<p>Did SUSY theories got stuck bcz they got lost in the elegance of their
equations?</p>
<p>By itself looking for elegance isn't bad. Elegance in math modeling
parlor just means as simple as possible, concise, a certain economy in
equations. The real problem is if your starting point is wrong, u can
get elegance all along the way while modeling and still end up in a
ditch bcz of starting point was wrong, and overall view of things were
deficient. I could elegantly model shadows, with all its weirdnesses,
find countless math tricks to get over the "multiplying shadow
problem", "bent shadow problem" and if someone asks, say "shut up and
compute!".</p>
<p>The real problem is using elegance as the <em>only</em> yardstick on judging
a result.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to store energy. Some lift up bunch of water,
so if u let it fall from that height it would give you energy. Some
compress air (decomp gives energy back). All fine methods but I'd
rather have a fuel I can transport around and potentially have an
element that carries energy even in its inert form.</p>

<p>I am not talking about gold as an investment, lost person. I am
talking about the gold standard, as in, a gold backed currency. The
latter is unworkable. In a narrow sense, for right now, in the little

marry it, have children with it - who cares?</p>
<hr />
<p>SUSY model is an extension of the standard model, a hodge podge

universe. That's why realists say the rot is deeper, with the Cop QM.</p>

<p>Haha! Physicist looking for help from "AI" to fix their theories.. Now
you really reached the end of your rope my friend.</p>
<p>“On string theory, etc., I've been wondering about the possibility
that an AI may actually be able to 'learn' a particular model and
calculate its consequences even of this was too hard for any human
mathematician. If it came up with numbers for the physical constants
that agreed (or that disagreed) with the real world, would we then be
happy to accept its verdict on the theory? I think the answer is
probably 'yes' -- but it's not as clear-cut as in the case of (say)
the 4-colour theorem -- in that latter case the program used is
transparent, whereas in the case of AI (even existing cases like Alpha
Go Zero) tor programmer doesn't understand what the computer does.”</p>

<p>Inflation is a sign of wage levels; if ppl had money they'd spend, at
certain point you'd see inflation starting to creep up. The fact that
US has persistently low inflation means ppl dont have money. For big
ticket items (house, college) there are forms of structured
debt. Regular consumption is different. How many cars can a
billionaire buy? One? How many could 1000 millionaires buy? One
thousand? Probably? Less concentrated wealth is socially better. 1000
ppl have cars instead of 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>1% here, 1% there. Truth of the matter is US is living in a
persistently low inflation environment. Potential sources of inflation:</p>
<p>1) Exports more than imports </p>
<p>2) Bank lending (credit creates new money)</p>
<p>3) Wages </p>
<p>4) Gov printing (spending more than it gets in taxes)</p>
<p>#1 does not apply to US. #4, no, bcz of US dom, its debt is snapped
up. #2 money goes into servicing existing debt, speculation, creating
bubbles there. That leaves #3, but because of technology and
outsourcing, wages are not growing. Result: no inflation.</p>
<p>US is a creditor's paradise, $ denominated debt does not lose its
value.  Debtors can borrow at low rates, then they get sucked in an
never-ending Ponzi scheme.</p>
