<p>I thought capitalist want ppl 'not to sit on their ass and
work'. People w wealth, especially inherited wealth, do exactly
that. If u tax wealth, like real estate just sitting there
appreciating collecting rent, that would incentivize work, right?</p>
<p>'But the rich worked to get there then w wealth they can rest'. The
poor works too, then more, then more. When do they get a rest?</p>
<p>'But the poor does not know what to work on, work smart'. Look, there
is a reason why we instintively deny such thought. We have the genes
of ppl who survived the harshest race ever. We know, deep down, the
current 'game' is made up, artificial.</p>
<p>Maybe if this artificial game lasted long enough it would select its
own genetic survivors, but each game is stupider, shorter than the
last. 50k years of agrarian era now gone. Then industrial, 300 yrs
gone. So now, what, everyone is an office monkey sitting at a desk?
Nah.</p>

<p>Hilbert: "Every boy in the streets of Göttingen understands more about
four-dimensional geometry than Einstein. Yet, in spite of that,
Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians.”</p>
<p>It's not necessary to have that gun-slinging problem-cruncher ability
that works equally well in every subdomain. You hit those subdomains
as needed. What's needed is the ability to model mathematically, to
pose the right questions, and have a sense where to find the answers.</p>
<p>We've had decades of problem-crunchers, and physics is
stuck. Multiverses, alt. universes sound imaginative and sexy but they
are really not. Some1 dropped the ball way back and crunchers have
been blindly toiling in that direction ever since.</p>
