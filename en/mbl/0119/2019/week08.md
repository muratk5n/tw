Actually EU is not abt breaking up nations, "superceding" them. If that were the case they would happily take in pieces of a broken up Spain. But they did not like Catalonian independence, and rebuffed its "seperatist" leader.

That makes sense bcz otherwise states would have no incentive to join. The EU is shockingly abt keeping things the way they are.

TR, Russia betting on gold standard is a guarantee that it will never happen. Others will rather back a scheme based on free-range chickens (hey, it's rare) than gold.

More towards west there is a "Mount Olympus". This is the _third_ one I've been near BTW.. 1 in Greece, 1 in Cyprus, now here... 

Could someone work thru the legends to find the real MO? Thanks.

Terrain model smooths over it. But the sample data used is 4% collected from a dense grid. In an integer lat/lon block that means 4 pts per sq kilometer. It does great with mountains, valleys, etc. That ditch.. very hard.

---

Yeah...  there is no way interpolation could catch that ditch. I stood near it, it was like a grand canyon down there; but essentially it is <10 meters deep. Goog Elev raw data gets it

I dont try too hard to be a "generalist specialist". The shit finds
me. At an Aegean resort listening to FM radio, stumble upon a
Christian station (in TR yes). It talks abt how Bible mentions "do not
fear" dozens of times. This is funny cuz tigga nat anthem starts with
dat ..

.. same sentence. The author of the anthem was devout Muslim. Then I
be connectin, connectin them dots..

Mazucatto book is not bad; the narrative forgets sometimes how we got here, from state running everything -and doing a bad job at that- to privitizing 80s and 90s. But essentially, on state being a driver for innovation, funding, setting direction, it is right.

IMO it is irresponsible to get on TV and keep harping abt a potential / at least a few yrs away crisis and keep recommending $ and bond exits. People might apply that advice soon, on a wrong timeline, not that this "cacerolada" crowd provides that sometimes, if ever.

@EconguyRosie

Nice. This is no electrolysis BTW. No electricity is ran through the water. U simply shine the light on the thing, and starts generating hydrogen. Much closer to how nature generates energy perhaps, e.g. plants.
