<p>"We have slashed and burned the core features of childhood ...</p>
<p>In the past 10,000 years — a barely perceptible sliver of evolutionary time — virtually every feature of childhood has changed, particularly in industrialized societies. Instead of growing up in a mixed-age collective, our children spend most of their time indoors with same-age peers. Gone are the days of evading grown-ups: Constant supervision is expected. Recess, the last vestige of free play, is on the brink of extinction. I contributed to this myself as a camp counselor, shepherding kids to structured activities, convinced that by teaching them rules or settling their disputes, I was helping them grow.</p>
<p>I don’t think this anymore.

waitress “sister” and says, “It’s okay, my boyfriend is black,” at

<p>When watching <em>Pulp Fiction</em> I did not know who wrote the
screenplay. But there is one part when Jules says "Well I'm a mushroom
cloud laying motherfucker, motherfucker". I thought, I bet the author
was writing freely, the sentence sorta turned out that way, two mo-fos
fell next to eachother. But grammatically it is correct so he kept
it. That's when I knew a white guy wrote it. Because only a white guy
would be anal enough to worry abt the grammar of smack, do what he
did, and think it funny (which it was, of course).</p>

it is when ppl simply sit on their money, delaying purchases and the
entire economy grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>Libertards are farm-dwelling folk in mind, if not in actuality. They
like to have their "land" with its "borders", they'll bury their gold
in there, whose value should not go down... wife and lots of kids,
maybe with a goat on the side, and they'll live happily
everafter... They don't care what happens outside. This is the dream
