<p>Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>
<p>"In 2001, one of the most important business historians of the
twentieth century, Alfred Chandler, would note that this suit led to
IBM’s decision to unbundle its software, and that decision “became and
remained central to the evolution of the computer industry worldwide.”
The suit, as Ed Black of the Computer and Communications Industry
Association put it in 1997, also “signaled to both venture capitalists
and key, talented individuals that they could, in fact, start new
firms and not be stifled by Big Blue.” ...</p>
<p>The successes of the suit did not register among the new economists
and antitrust lawyers trained in the Chicago School framework. They
could no longer tell the difference between healthy markets and big
companies, and chalked up the competition in the technology industry
to nature, rather than antitrust policy. A mythos emerged around
Silicon Valley, that a set of institutions built on democratic
protection of the engineer and scientist from the monopolist was
instead born from antigovernment garage tinkerers"</p>

<p>Exactly. What I've been saying 4ever - showing steps the inventors
went through for their discoveries is essential for teaching,
especially to prospective researchers.</p>
<p>"Reacting to criticism concerning the lack of motivation in his
writings, Gauss remarked that architects of great cathedrals do not
obscure the beauty of their work by leaving the scaffolding in place
after the construction has been completed. His philosophy epitomized
the formal presentation and teaching of mathematics throughout the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it is still commonly found in
mid-to-upper-level mathematics textbooks. The inherent efficiency and
natural beauty of mathematics are compromised by straying too far from
Gauss’s viewpoint. But, as with most things in life, appreciation is
generally preceded by some understanding seasoned with a bit of
maturity, and in mathematics this comes from seeing some of the
scaffolding" -- Meyer, <em>Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra</em></p>

<p>BC definitely set the tone for the post Berlin Wall world - and not
for the better. Dubya was 100% in Clinton-mold - that's how he
presented himself (in an underhanded kind of way). His personality,
2000 positioning basically boiled down to "I'll give you Clinton, and
there'll be less d#$k sucking in the Oval Office". Right? "Son of a
President you see, I won't be as crass". That was the sales
pitch. Southerner, check.  Governor, check. About same age,
check. With all that he managed to out-Clinton Gore, <em>another
Southerner</em>, who thanks the worst campaign manager hired in decades,
failed to show loyalty to the man who hired him, and lost the election
during good times!</p>
<hr />
<p>I remember a Clinton speech after 9/11 talking about data collection,
by "(paraphrasing) making use of the kind of data the credit card
companies already collect on us everyday". "Watch for patterns in the
data, normal behaviour fine, outside the normal, up to no good". Well,
when the primo fucko is saying all this stuff, why not go ahead and
built the biggest spying network known to mankind? Which is what they
did.</p>

<p>Can plentiful fish create an agro-like environment (like harvesting,
you can store, storage creates centralized ownership, hierarchy)?</p>
<p>Actually fishing, even during agro would create an foraging-like
environment - go out to nature, get stuff, it's always there, you
don't have to 'cultivate' it. See Ian Morris.</p>
<p>There are ways of handling the storage issue wout creating undue
social structure. Plus storage doesn't create an exclusive food
source, ppl can still go out and fish. American Indians hunted bisons,
and stored excess food in the form of pemmican, and Indians remained

right out of the Ben Bernanke-- what was Ben Bernanke's moniker?  Ben
Bernanke, before November 2002, was not called Helicopter Ben [as in

after November 2002 because the famous 'What If' speech, "what if we
got caught in this deflationary trap of the zero bond in interest
rates?".  ...  But the Fed stopped short of the big bomb.  And the big
bomb is debt monetization.  And so you're asking me what is it that's
going to happen.  We're going to eliminate, we're going to have a

eliminate a lot of this debt through the transaction.  ... so this is

<p>YoY inflation 1.76, T10YR at 1.72.</p>
<p>"Aaww but we are in debt yields gonna blow!" Not happening (yet). The
biggest risk for bonds is inflation risk (principal, coupons are paid,
guaranteed, but if money is worth less, problem). HOWEVER if USD is
dropped as world's reserve curr, massive debt monetization, then there
might be inflation - but this event is hard to predict. Might as well
make some $ until it happens. </p>

<p>What happens once the last Bitcoin is mined? What incentive will
miners have to have their servers up to process transactions?
Transaction fees could be one, but by then off-chain solutions like
Lightning would be propagating txns through completely different
network structure, not through miners, than not much txn $$ would be
coming their way.</p>
<p>It will be weird. The whole proof-of-work and limited # of coins

<hr />
<p>From Navarro's book <em>Death by China</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The] process begins when you or I walk into a store like Walmart and
buy a Chinese product, after which our dollars are shipped
overseas. At this point, to maintain the U.S. dollar’s fixed peg to
the yuan, China must promptly recycle our “Walmart dollars” back into
the United States by buying financial assets such as U.S. government
bonds, U.S. real estate, or U.S. companies; otherwise, upward
pressures would build on the yuan. ...</p>
<p>Before the Chinese government can recycle any of our Walmart dollars,
it must gain control of those dollars from the Chinese exporters that
accumulated them. This requires a convoluted process known as
<em>sterilization</em>.</p>
<p>To sterilize our Walmart dollars, the Chinese government forces its
exporters to buy Chinese government bonds denominated in
U.S. dollars. In return for surrendering their greenbacks, exporters
then receive about 4% interest on the sterilization bonds. The
Chinese government then turns around and reinvests the captured
sterilized greenbacks back into U.S. government bonds that pay less
than 2% interest. China thereby loses 2% or more in interest on every
dollar it sterilizes—and the losses run into the billions!</p>
<p>Just why is the Chinese central bank willing to shoulder such huge
losses? It is because the Communist Party is far more interested in
creating jobs to maintain political stability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This creates distortion in the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Dollar reserves built up throughout the world to combat currency
attacks, act similarly.</p>
<p>Also selling debt can allow a country to recycle old debt with new
debt, allowing it to obtain dollars, covering up the real value of a
currency = distortion.</p>
<p>The old model is broken in many ways. We need a new system.</p>
<p>"Why aren't exchange rates adjusting themselves automatically
according to trade deficits?"</p>

<p>"Would ppl buy goods with their UBI from the companies in bad shape,
helping them stay afloat?". Maybe. And maybe not. Trusting ppl with
those dollars is still a better idea tho rather than coddling
overextended companies.</p>
<hr />
<p>So maybe a special UBI that kicks in during downturns, it can be keyed
off a particular macro parameter, say GDP deceleration for two
consecutive quarters. </p>
<hr />
<p>"Government increasing spending during downturns" is a really, really
stupid idea - as in spending that'll help businesses to stay
afloat. They even had the left go along with this shit (bcz biz would
not fire workers if they were held afloat). Downturn is nature's way
of telling overextended businesses to trim down or die the fuck
off. If that process is artificially hampered, than we end up with
zombies, who cannot grow but can keep limpin around also thanks to low
rates, who would not hire more workers anyway, or increase wages.</p>
<p>During downturns help needs to go to people not to companies. People
might get laid off from overextended companies which is bad, so help
them directly, not to the companies.</p>

<p>Science is still in its dark ages. Most papers still do not share data

they'd make it mandatory to get a Jupyter notebook, or at least

publication.</p>
<p>Gov is slippin, they should make it mandatory for data / code to be
shared as part of their grant process.</p>
<p>And that is only for starters - I have an idea to force all math to be
verifiable through an automatic theorem prover, but that is too crazy
for now. I'd settle for data and code.</p>
