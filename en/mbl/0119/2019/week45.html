<p>"Thanks to the Austrian scientist Peter Schuster and his associates,
though, the RNA library is not a lost cause. One of the grandfathers
of computational biology in Europe, Schuster is now a retired
professor at the University of Vienna, where he taught since the
1970s. A first encounter with Schuster seems to confirm the
stereotypes that many Europeans have of Austrians. A jovial man with a
generous girth and a wry sense of humor, Schuster would not have been
out of place in the traditional Viennese cafés of the last days of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, where formidably well-educated polymaths held
forth on everything from psychoanalysis to quantum theory. He is a
scientist in that tradition, a purebred intellectual conversant with a
broad variety of subjects. Not taking himself too seriously, Schuster
opines with a tongue-in-cheek attitude, peppering the gravest
discourse with humorous asides. He epitomizes an oft-repeated saying
about how Austrians view life and its many challenges: “The situation
may be hopeless, but it is never serious'" -- Wagner, <em>Arrival of the Fittest</em></p>

<p>I bet mainland Chink "history" is full of some dumbass shit too.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hear Russkie narrative is quite moronic too. Talked abt it briefly
<a href="https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2014/10/alex.html">here</a></p>
<p>It's all about finding that happy path it seems, a narrative that will
show you a winner most of the time (if a loser, u redirect it to
behing held down, it's never your fault). "Tigger came from Central
Asia" says one -completely false, some punk motherfuckers came but
melted away- which probably has to do wanting to associate with
something outside the current region, and conveniently blame the loss
of Balkans, and other regional troubles on "others" who were "the
wrong Turks anyway".</p>
<p>I think psychologists are wasting their time analyzing singular
people. They should focus on national psyches exclusively. There is
gold here.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are codes, which are transmitted organically. Then, seperate
from that, is the national narrative which is second wave and mostly
bullshit, it is top-down, created by others. As Gellner
<a href="https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2013/03/allegience-of-pion.html">says</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nationalism is not what it seems, and above all it is not what it
 seems to itself. The cultures it claims to defend and revive are
 often its own inventions, or are modified out of all
 recognition. [.. While it is being created] nationalism uses the
 pre-existing, historically inherited proliferation of cultures or
 cultural wealth, though it uses them very selectively, and it most
 often transforms them radically. Dead languages can be revived,
 traditions invented, quite fictitious pristine purities restored
 [..]. The cultural shreds and patches used by nationalism are often
 arbitrary historical inventions. Any old shred and patch would have
 served as well [..].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But some countries are better at this than others. The US narrative
taught in schools.. "Why did we seperate from England?". "Because
ruling from a distance was not effective". It is not non-sense.</p>
<p>Here is what TR text says abt why it lost in WWI. Uh, like, our big
ally Germany lost, so we lost, indirectly, by <em>association</em>.</p>
<p>Now that sounds like a load of bunk. It's like a tough guy story,
"yeah I've would have done some shit, but, they held me back son, I
was gonna bring it. Kick some ass.. Yeah!". Or like a boxer, "well, I
beat the other guy, but the referee, that guy man, did not give me
points. It was a technical loss.. that's what it was".</p>
<p>At least the narrative indirectly admits it was the junior partner in
the war effort, but the general outline is still somewhat 'lacking'.</p>

<p>"The 'what ifs' can kill you.</p>
<p>Something missed. A failure of will. A turn in one direction when the
other way was the right path.</p>
<p>Over time, people tend to get past them. We did what we could, they
say, and move on.</p>
<p>But, in terms of the tragedy of 9/11, a particular regret lingers for
those who might have made a difference.</p>
<p>The alarming August 6, 2001, memo from the CIA to the President--"Bin
Laden Determined to Strike in US"--has been widely noted in the past
few years.</p>
<p>But, also in August, CIA analysts flew to Crawford to personally brief
the President--to intrude on his vacation with face-to-face alerts.</p>
<p>The analytical arm of CIA was in a kind of panic mode at this
point. Other intelligence services, including those from the Arab
world, were sounding an alarm. The arrows were all in the red. They
didn't know place or time of an attack, but something was coming. The
President needed to know.</p>
<p>Verbal briefings of George W. Bush are acts of almost inestimable
import in the affairs of the nation--more so than is the case for
other recent presidents. He's not much of a reader, this President,
and never has been, despite White House efforts to trumpet which
serious books he is reading at various times. He's not a President who
sees much value in hearing from a wide array of voices--he has made
that clear. His circle of truly trusted advisers is small--smaller as
President, in many ways, than it was when he was governor. But he's a
very good listener and an extremely visual listener. He sizes people
up swiftly and aptly, watches them carefully, and trusts his eyes. It
is a gift, this nonverbal acuity, that he relies on in managing the
almost overwhelming duties of the presidency: countless decisions each
day, each one important; a daunting array of issues to grasp; an
endless stream of politicized experts and expert politicos, all
speaking in earnest tones. What does George W. Bush do? He makes it
personal. He may not have had a great deal of experience, especially
in foreign affairs, before arriving in the job, but--because of his
trust in these interpretive abilities--he doesn't view that as a
deficit. The expert, sitting before him, has done the hard work, the
heavy lifting, and the President tries to gauge how "certain" they are
of what they say, even if the issues may be unfamiliar to him. Do they
seem nervous or unsure? Are they fudging? Why do they think what they
do…and what do they think of him? That last part is very important.</p>
<p>The trap, of course, is that while these tactile, visceral markers can
be crucial--especially in terms of handling the posturing of top
officials--they sometimes are not. The thing to focus on, at certain
moments, is what someone says, not who is saying it, or how they're
saying it.</p>
<p>And, at an eyeball-to-eyeball intelligence briefing during this urgent
summer, George W. Bush seems to have made the wrong choice.</p>

<p>California.. the immigrant state. Is that why its public services
suck? Get bunch of people from anywhere so they don't make many
demands of the state? They just work and pay tax like a slave? So
public schools suck, privatized power is only good for starting fires.</p>

<p>Snowden, <em>Permanent Record</em></p>
<p>"The EU, still under the sway of this postwar universalist idealism,
now became the first transnational body to put these principles into
practice, establishing a new directive that seeks to standardize
whistleblower protections across its member states, along with a
standardized legal framework for privacy protection. In 2016, the EU
Parliament passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the
most significant effort yet made to forestall the incursions of
technological hegemony—which the EU tends to regard, not unfairly, as
an extension of American hegemony.</p>
<p>The GDPR treats the citizens of the European Union, whom it calls
“natural persons,” as also being “data subjects”—that is, people who
generate personally identifiable data. In the US, data is usually
regarded as the property of whoever collects it. But the EU posits
data as the property of the person it represents, which allows it to
treat our data subjecthood as deserving of civil liberties
protections"</p>
