# Week 20

We mentioned the movie The Social Network was mostly right on the
events surrounding Facebook. However, it seems TBS got Zuckerberg's
typing wrong. In the movie Zuckerberg is pictured as somewhat robotic,
who parses language to death, anal about definitions, etc., implying
an NT.

There are two issues here: One, Holywood has problems portraying NT
characters to begin with. Due to NT's strategic, scientific
preference, they are usually presented as mad scientists bent on world
domination on the big screen. This is clearly a disservice to these
people, among which, INTJs for one, do have a "soft side" (as do
others); the "T" can be tough with people, but there are other
elements in the character that softens the shell.

Zuckerberg's type is completely wrong as well; he is an NF, an
Idealist, not an NT. A few sentences uttered by the man that are part
of the public record would have cleared this up instantly. Pay
attention also to what Facebook does: it connects people. NFs tend to
be collaborative in reaching goals and I'd say a social network
qualifies as a pretty good collaborative tool.

This is really messed up. Someone needs to start collecting data on
worst polluters, map them out on Google Maps, and organize protests on
these locations. I've seen a coal based power plant in Las Vegas, with
stacks, mini-mountains of coal waiting to be burned, and the guy
working there says one of those little mountains equals only to one
hour of electricity for Las Vegas. This is f.cked up shit. Governments
are asleep at the wheel. But then again, why should that be a
surprise?

"Greenhouse gas emissions increased by a record amount last year, to
the highest carbon output in history, putting hopes of holding global
warming to safe levels all but out of reach, according to unpublished
estimates from the International Energy Agency.

The shock rise means the goal of preventing a temperature rise of more
than 2 degrees Celsius – which scientists say is the threshold for
potentially "dangerous climate change" – is likely to be just "a nice
Utopia", according to Fatih Birol, chief economist of the IEA. It also
shows the most serious global recession for 80 years has had only a
minimal effect on emissions, contrary to some predictions"

Obama suggests Bin Laden probably received support from the Pakistani
government, or elements within it, to be able to reside at the
compound where he was ultimately found. I agree. If he had explicit
Pak support, he would be useful as a bargaining chip to be traded in
later for some kind of US favor. If not, hell, during the war against
Soviets, Taliban received support from ISI, and Paks for many
years. During that time Taliban fighters' families lived in Pakistan
and the mujaheddin used to come to visit them for holidays. There are
a lot of old connections there, it would not be surprising if some
remaining elements from that era helping Bin Laden.

Is it a good idea to hit Paks on the head on this issue? Yes. Ruffling
some feathers, shaking things up little is a good idea, it might help
Paks to take more responsibility and start putting their house in
order.

Nice development... BTW, Marxist morons should think twice before
celebrating, since this has nothing to do with disappearance of the
free market, it has everything to do with the collapse of
modernity. One-size-fits-all approaches to "using items (as in owning
them)" is disappearing. People on the go, (a side effect of 3rd wave)
need more flexible arrangements to use things, and more and more the
new generation is finding out what is essential for living and what is
not.

People who move after a long time are always surprised to discover how
much junk they collected in their house, let's think about that and
understand that the new generation does this much more frequently now
and therefore has a better understanding of the issue of ownership in
21st century.

Markets are good at allocation of resources, and allocation of unused
resources through these new scheduling, record keeping systems powered
by the Internet is a shining example of this.

Fast Company: "[..] Gorenflo is a leading proselytizer of a global
trend to make sharing something far more economically significant than
a primitive behavior taught in preschool. Spawned by a confluence of
the economic crisis, environmental concerns, and the maturation of the
social web, an entirely new generation of businesses is popping
up. They enable the sharing of cars, clothes, couches, apartments,
tools, meals, and even skills. The basic characteristic of these
you-name-it sharing marketplaces is that they extract value out of the
stuff we already have. Many of these sites depend on millennials
disenchanted by the housing bubble and the banking crisis, or
uninterested in traditional icons of success such as house or auto
ownership. But the number of people who have quietly begun tapping in
is impressive: Already, more than 3 million people from 235 countries
have couch-surfed, while 2.2 million bike-sharing trips are taken each
month. Contends Rachel Botsman, coauthor of the recently published
What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption: "This
could be as big as the Industrial Revolution in the way we think about
ownership."

The evolution of the social web, explains Botsman, first enabled
programmers to share code (Linux), then allowed people to share their
lives (Facebook), and most recently encouraged creators to share their
content (YouTube). "Now we're going into the fourth phase," says
Botsman, "where people are saying, 'I can apply the same technology to
share all kinds of assets offline, from the real world.' [..] The
central conceit of collaborative consumption is simple: Access to
goods and skills is more important than ownership of them.

The earliest of these marketplaces, like Freecycle and CouchSurfing,
encouraged the exchange of goods among peers for free. But the latest
sharing platforms are anchored in commerce. They have the potential to
amass a new ecosystem of entrepreneurs, just as eBay once aggregated
fragmented buyers and sellers into a global online
marketplace. Gartner Group researchers estimate that the peer-to-peer
financial-lending market will reach $5 billion by 2013"

Also industrial production *itself* tends to become more automated,
services-like, less dependent on labor, with higher degree of
knowledge input as it develops, hence the political power distribution
in the society *will* shift according to services no matter what.

The Economist: "Development [for poor countries] typically involves
moving workers from low-productivity activities such as subsistence
farming to high-productivity sectors. That points to a shift into
manufacturing because it lends itself to specialisation and economies
of scale [..] Services, in contrast, appear to be a graveyard for
productivity. Because a haircut or a restaurant meal has to be
delivered in person, there is almost no potential to exploit economies
of scale and to export [..]

That conventional wisdom is now under fire, in a book edited by Ejaz
Ghani of the World Bank [..] The authors argue that technology and
outsourcing are enabling services to overcome their former
handicaps. Traditional services such as trade, hotels, restaurants and
public administration remain largely bound by the old constraints. But
[new age] services, such as software development, call centres and
outsourced business processes (from insurance claims to transcribing
medical records), use skilled workers, exploit economies of scale and
can be exported. In other words, they are just like manufacturing. If
that is the case, then poor countries should be able to go straight
from agriculture to services, leapfrogging manufacturing [..]

In poor countries as a whole, services have contributed more to growth
since 1980 than has industry"

Great news. As we wrote before in Bloodshed and the Roman Empire [..]
According to Bernard Lewis' What Went Wrong? Bin Laden talks about a
saddening point in time in history and mentions the year 1918. Most
people in the world do not know the significance that year, but people
in Asia Minor know it very well. It is a great day (in my view)
because it's the time when the Ottoman Empire finally collapsed. Sadly
what came in its place wasnt that great either, but I am just glad
that the old archaic structure finally disappeared. Now what do we
have here? Rome Version 3.0, which represents another authrotic,
despotic marriage between centralized religion and state, this
structure collapses and Bin Laden is SAD ABOUT THAT. This is the same
Bin Laden who is responsible for thousands of deaths in 9/11.

Nuf said.

We talked about how lots of data can make a difference in some
application, not in others. But of course, *more* data is always
better than *none*. I am trying to find data on Earth's crust, its
composition in a resolution of, say, down to 100 meters.. and there is
none. We have the tools to store, visualize, process and disseminate
such data, yet we do not have data itself.

Maybe we need a data collection of effort on the scale of Google's
StreetView for earth crust data (as well as other things) w/ ppl
poking equipment in the ground all over the world.

We still lack a lot of data like this that can be used by scientists,
amateur or otherwise. Researchers funded by taxpayers are also sitting
on data that can be useful for modelers, we saw this in
Scholarly-Industrial Complex post). Releasing data to all can do
magic, the Goldscorp example in Wikinomics book (Donald Tapscott)
comes to mind.

Peter Lax: "It is impossible to exaggerate the extent to which modern
applied mathematics has been shaped and fueled by the general
availability of fast computers with large memories. Their impact on
mathematics, both applied and pure, is comparable to the role of the
telescopes in astronomy and microscopes in biology".

"You read that correctly--Bezos is betting on nuclear fusion, the holy
grail of nuclear nerds everywhere. Today's nuclear plants generate
power from fission, a process that splits atoms to release energy as
heat.[..] The amount of hydrogen isotopes found in one liter of water
could generate the power of 1,000 liters of gasoline. Some of the
hydrogen isotopes for the process can be found in seawater, and others
can be found in lithium. This means that nuclear fusion should be able
to provide virtually unlimited amounts of clean energy. [..] There is
also no risk of meltdown or production of long-lived nuclear waste. In
other words, there will never be a nuclear fusion Fukushima disaster.

In the past, no one has been able to create a controlled fusion
reaction that creates more energy than was used to start it. So
General Fusion certainly sounds a little crazy in saying that it
can. But the company is confident, claiming that it will have a
full-scale proof-of-concept fusion generator within four years"

"I finished reading In The Plex, a great book on Google. There were
some interesting passages on how some Google employees went to
Washington, their experiences, the animosity they drew in while they
were there. Their experiences is a perfect example of the conflict
between two waves. Two waves are different from eachother as oil and
water, they cannot mix, and eventually one will rise to top and
replace other (the older one always loses). Some important paragraphs:

They joined a team of techie Obamanauts who saw their job as bringing
the digital tools of empowerment to Washington. [..]

But when the outsiders like Stanton hit the nation’s capital, they
went straight into a buzz saw of illogic, bad intentions, mistrust,
and, worst of all, obsolete gadgets. Not only were they chained to
outdated Windows computers, but they were denied the Internet tools
they had come to rely on as much as breathing. Rules dictated that
there could be no Facebook, no Google Talk, no Gmail, no Twitter, no
Skype. (Even the president had to fight to retain his BlackBerry, and
the one he wound up with was slowed down by security add-ons and
cordoned off to all but a few designated texters.) “I’d been going a
million miles an hour at Google,” she says. “And suddenly there were
all these rules. Where you can put content. The Presidential Records
Act. Terms of service agreements.” [..]. Not long after she took the
job, Stanton did a reply-all email, which was common at Google. At the
White House, someone took her aside and reprimanded her. [..]

The job was frustrating. Google hadn’t been perfect, but people got
things done [..]. One of the big ideas of Google was that if you gave
engineers the freedom to dream big and the power to do it—if you built
the whole operation around their mind-set and made it clear that they
were in charge—the impossible could be accomplished. But in the
government, even though Stanton’s job was to build new technologies
and programs, “I didn’t meet one engineer,” she says. “Not one
software engineer who works for the United States government. I’m sure
they exist, but I haven’t met any. At Google I worked with people far
smarter and creative than me, and they were engineers, and they always
made everyone else look good. They’re doers. We get stuck in the
government because we really don’t have a lot of those people.” [..]

At a conference in January 2010, Stanton expressed her feelings about
the difference between the White House and Google. “Working in
government,” she said, “is like running a
marathon. Blindfolded. Wearing sandbags.” Whereas Google was
collegial, working for the White House was like a season of the
reality show Survivor, whose motto was “Outwit, outplay, outlast.”
[..]

[M]any of the Obamanauts’ dreams seemed to dissipate. Julius
Genachowski’s efforts to extend broadband coverage met resistance at
every turn. He did manage to get some billions of stimulus-related
dollars devoted to building out broadband. But his efforts to enforce
“net neutrality”—ensuring equal treatment of Internet services by
providers such as AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast—were blocked by the
corporations and even the courts. [..]

Both the government and Google found themselves targets of the
powerful communications companies, who had used their power to profit
from a system where Americans paid more for and got worse Internet
service than much of the rest of the developed world.

The corporations spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress to make
sure that regulations would not impede their efforts. They funded
think tanks to create studies that attempted to prove that the current
U.S. broadband coverage really wasn’t so bad. (What’s wrong with being
twelfth out of the top twelve economies in the developed world?) One
organization the corporations helped finance, called Consumer
Watchdog, created a blog called “Inside Google” that demonized every
move from Mountain View, from Google’s China policy to its ad quality
algorithm. Opponents of Google characterized net neutrality as akin to
communism.

Katie Stanton felt she’d had enough. “I feel like I’m a vegetarian
trapped inside the sausage factory and it’s kind of ugly on the
inside,” she said in the spring of 2010. In July, she left the State
Department and took a job at Twitter. [.. T]here was one thing she
could not understand. For all the love that Google got from its users
and all the support that the Obama administration had gotten from
Google, actually being from Google was almost like a handicap. “I was
shocked at how much it almost hurt me,” she said. “Sometimes people
treated it like a criminal record.”"

"The body of a girl thought to have been murdered by Roman soldiers has
been discovered in north Kent. Archaeologists working on the site of a
Roman settlement near the A2 uncovered the girl who died almost 2,000
years ago. "She was killed by a Roman sword stabbing her in the back
of the head," said Dr Paul Wilkinson, director of the excavation. "By
the position of the entry wound she would have been kneeling at the
time."

The Roman conquest of Britain began in AD43, and the construction of
Watling Street started soon afterwards linking Canterbury to St Albans
[..] Dr Wilkinson said that she had been between 16 and 20 years old
when she was killed, and her bones suggested that she had been in good
health. [..]

The burial site was just outside the Roman town, with cemeteries close
by. Many people have a romantic view of the Roman invasion, Dr
Wilkinson said. "Now, for the first time, we have an indication of how
the Roman armies treated people, and that large numbers of the local
populations were killed"

Wired: "On Father’s Day three years ago, biologist Jonathan Eisen
decided he’d like to republish all his father’s papers. His father,
Howard Eisen, a biologist and a researcher at the National Institutes
of Health, had published 40-some-odd papers by the time that he died
by suicide at age 45. [..]

How hard could it be? Howard Eisen had been a federal employee, so his
work rightly lay in some sense in the public domain. And Jonathan, as
an heir, presumably owned copyright anyway, along with his brother
Michael (also a biologist, and one of PLoS’s founders). Yet to the
brothers’ continuing chagrin, Jonathan has found securing and
publishing his father’s papers to be far harder than he expected.

For instance, even though Jonathan has access to the enormous
University of California library system, which subscribes to a
particularly high number of journals, he often can’t even find some
his father’s papers. And when he finds a paper in a journal the
university doesn’t subscribe to, he is asked to pay as much as $50 to
read the paper — even though his father did the work with public
funds. He’s not alone; one recent study found that even most
university researchers have access to only about half the papers they
need to cite for a given bit of research. Just yesterday, in fact,
Jonathan asked on Twitter if anyone could send him a copy of one of
his father’s paper and confronted a paywall asking for his credit card
number. “I ain’t payin’,” he replied.

So for now, his father’s work remains buried in an old structure — a
calcified matrix. Though Jonathan bangs away at the surrounding rock,
he knows he hasn’t really pried the work loose. This frustrates him on
two fronts: It stops him from freeing his father’s work. And it
confirms to him science, which should be a fluid medium, has much of
its content still trapped in old structures.

Jonathan Eisen’s quest has solidified his conviction that science
needs to radically rework the way it collects and shares its data,
methods, and findings. He has plenty of company. A growing number of
prominent scientists want to replace the aging journal system with
something faster, cheaper, and richer. The current system, they note,
grew out of meeting notes and journals published by societies in
Europe over three centuries ago. Back then, quarterly or monthly
volumes could accommodate the flow of ideas and data from most
disciplines, and the printed journal, though it required a top-heavy,
expensive printing and publishing infrastructure, was the most
efficient way to share those ideas.

“But now,” says Jonathan Eisen, “there’s this thing called the
Internet. It changes not just how things can be done but how they
should be done.”

[..] ‘I want a poor student to have the same means of indulging his
learned curiosity, … of consulting the same authorities, … as the
richest man in the kingdoms,’ is today within reach. With the
Internet, we have the means to make humanity’s treasury of knowledge
freely available to scientists, teachers, students and the public
around the world.”  “The existing system worked well for quite a
while,” says Jonathan Eisen. “But it was not designed by theory. It
was designed by constraints.” In a world that provides communications
conduits far larger and faster, those constraints have now made
science’s traditional pipeline a bottleneck. [..]

Why don’t we do [open] science [..] all the time? Part of the answer,
strangely, is the very thing at the center of science: the paper. Once
science’s main conduit, the paper has become its choke point.

It’s not just that the paper is slow, though that is a huge problem. A
researcher who submits a paper to a traditional journal right now, for
instance, won’t see the published piece for about a year. She must
wait while the paper gets passed around among editors then goes
through rounds of peer review by experts in her field who might and
often do object not just to her methods or data but to her findings
and interpretations. Finally, she must wait while it moves through an
editing, layout, and publishing pipeline that itself might run
anywhere from 2 to 12 weeks.

Yet the paper is not simply slow; it’s heavy. Even as increasingly
data-rich science has outgrown the paper’s ability to deliver and
describe all that science has to offer — its deep databases, its often
elaborate methods — we’ve loaded it up needlessly with reputational
weight and vital functions other than carrying data.

The paper is meant to be a conduit for the real content and currency
of the science: the ideas, methods, data, and findings of the people
who do science. But the tremendous publishing and commercial
infrastructure built around the academic paper over the last
half-century has concentrated so many functions and so much value in
the journal that the paper itself, rather than the information in it,
has become science’s main currency. It is the paper you must buy; the
paper you must publish; the paper you must cite; the paper on which
not just citations but tenure, reputation, status, and even school
rankings are built"

I am catching up with my writing after a short break since I am in a
tropical island that sometimes loses its Internet connection -
whazzzup!. In The Plex has a very detailed account on how Chinese
government broke into Google's computers and stole some of their
proprietry internal software.

What the Chinese have done is perfectly on code. The culture code
Chinese assign themselves is RECIPROCITY, meaning that do unto others
as they do unto you. And, combined with some weird interpretation of
their own history, this is the result, plain and simple. The Chinese
view of history is that they developed an advanced civilization, made
great strides in science and technology, and Westerners stole
everything from them. And now due to RECIPROCITY, they are only paying
the Westerners in kind. They stole things from us, we steal it right
back from them.

There are also few additional factors, e.g. a Chinese student learns
from his master / teacher, by copying. This is a sign of respect, but,
the major factor is the code outlined above. Clotaire Rapaille who
came up with this code goes as far as saying that it is not
unfathomable that one day the Chinese government nationalize all
foreign assets in China, and kick all foreign companies out -- he
recommends a "short term strategy" in China for these companies.

Note: He made a similar prediction for Venezuella pre-Chavez which
turned out to be correct.

"
In a recent debate with Stephen Downes, I spent some time going
through dozens of papers and meta-studies showing that the lecture is
a largely disastrous pedagogic technique, devoid of formative
assessment, diagnosis of student understanding, actual teaching or
inspiration.

I wasn’t surprised at the qualitative nature of Stephen’s response, as
I’ve heard it many times before 1) that lectures are not about
‘teaching’ but ‘showing practice ’i.e. what it’s like to be a
physicist, whatever, 2) some lectures are good e.g. Martin Luther
King’s speech etc. and 3) lectures must be good as they’ve been around
for so long.

I don’t buy any of these arguments as 1) that’s not what lecturers or
students think, expect or require, 2) the fact that a chosen few can
do something well (like surgery or any other form of expertise)
doesn’t mean that it should be done by everyone 3) slavery was around
for millennia but it doesn’t make it right – you can’t derive an
‘ought’ from an ‘is’. [..]

Academics will go to great lengths to defend traditional lectures [..]
However, there comes appoint when the evidence [..] must win out. This
paper points towards something that decades of research have
confirmed, that there must be a rethink on lectures. We may then have
a chance to dramatically change teaching in Higher Education for the
better, also making to cheaper. In other words, get good teachers to
teach and let researchers research."

"You might not be able to play Portal 2 on it, but a new product from
the British nonprofit Raspberry Pi Foundation aims to put a working
computer into children's hands for the ultra-low cost of $25 per
device. [..] For average consumers, don't expect this computer to look
anything like what you're used to seeing on your desk, in your lap, or
stuffed in your messenger bag. [..] But it's certainly a computer. In
fact, the 700-MHz ARM11 processor slapped on to the tiny piece of
silicon, roughly the size of a USB stick, is a faster chip than what
was originally found in Apple's iPhone 3G—just to put it into
perspective.

A total of 128 megabytes of SDRAM joins the processor, allowing the
super-tiny system to run a variety of Linux versions. [..] "In theory,
they could be given away to the child, with other ways of funding it,"
said Braben in a YouTube interview. "What they would do with it is
they would be able to engage in a lot of things that we're all
consumers of but not actually creators of: Understanding how you put
together little scripts that might run websites, that might look at
things like Facebook and Twitter, also email.""
