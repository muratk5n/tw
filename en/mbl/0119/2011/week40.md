Washingtonpost: UNESCO votes to admit Palestine; U.S. cuts off
funding.. The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) voted Monday to admit Palestine into the organization as its
newest member, and the United States promptly responded by cutting off
funding for the agency"

Darin Gibby: "Rewind patent laws to fast-forward innovation... The
patent market, like financial markets, thrives on certainty. When
inventors are sure their products will be protected, more people
invest in patents and, more importantly, in the technologies they
protect. But when patents cannot be understood, are difficult to
obtain, or become nearly impossible to enforce, much of the money that
would go toward research and development is spent on lawyers. These
legal fees drastically increase the barriers to investment for a
promising new idea, dulling America’s technological edge. The modern
trend of bundling patents into large portfolios for sale on the open
market further demonstrates how the patent market currently favors
large corporations over the individual entrepreneur.

As a patent attorney, I am constantly meeting hopeful inventors who
dream of securing a patent to protect their ideas. They have been told
by potential investors that they need a patent before they are willing
to invest in their technology. When I explain that a patent will cost
upwards of $30,000 and take around five years to obtain, their hopes
are dashed. The news only gets worse when I inform them that enforcing
a patent is a multi-million dollar proposition. At that point, most
simply give up.

In an effort to remedy this problem, President Barack Obama signed
into law the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) on Sept. 16, under
the auspices that it would “speed up the patent process so that
innovators and entrepreneurs can turn a new invention into a business
as quickly as possible.” This law, in fact, does the opposite"

The hacker culture always hated the closed nature of
iPod and iPhone. They hacked it many times, and continue to do so
because when people purchase a device, they believe they have
purchased the right to do whatever they want to their device, and when
they are blocked, they get really pissed. I tend to agree with their
view. In any case, here are Stallman's views [link]:

---

Stallman is against many things, he is also against centralized
services of any kind, including Google and Facebook. Instead, he
advocates services such as Diaspora that give users complete control
of their data and services, and are completely decentralized. Since
all Internet services are inherently distributed, all requests could
get propagated between users' "rented" services that carry Diaspora
decentralized nodes, and by way of constant propagation, they reach
their destination. Services such as email already get propagated
between many *big* nodes, Diaspora aims a future where every single
person's service can act as a delegator.

Stallman: "Steve Jobs, the pioneer of the computer as a jail made
cool, designed to sever fools from their freedom, has died.

As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor
Daley, "I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone." Nobody
deserves to have to die - not Jobs, not Mr. Bill, not even people
guilty of bigger evils than theirs. But we all deserve the end of
Jobs' malign influence on people's computing.

Unfortunately, that influence continues despite his absence. We can
only hope his successors, as they attempt to carry on his legacy, will
be less effective"

I think education’s current stance, encouraging memorization as little
as possible is the right one [1]. If a student can memorize however,
good for him / her, they can go ahead and do that. But curricula,
especially math curricula needs to be about deriving things, showing
how pieces connect, how to move from one concept to another, so
students understand how things are in relation to eachother, and that
kind of comparative ability is what makes science tick.

In your story, you and your friend could not remember Theorem X or Y,
so what? You had considerable skill in guessing where the answer would
be, and you researched it, connected the pieces, and reached the
conclusion. How is this not a success story?

Directing curricula can only be done in blunt moves, supporting
memorization is one of those blunt moves, but once started, the
details that follow can lead you in some dark places. Feynman saw this
up close when he taught for a while in Brasil, and after he came back
to US, he found the same thing in US curricula.

But I agree that having more things in memory (especially if they were
understood first) can make a difference in research.

"I have to say that I liked [a research problem] immediately. Dick and
I continued talking about it in his office right after lunch, where we
reduced a proof to a simple fact about Markov chains. We needed to
know the expected return time of a certain random walk. Unfortunately
Dick had to go teach class, so I told him I would search the library,
which was downstairs from his office, while he was in class. I hoped
that I could find a formula for the expected return time.

Recall this was in 1979 and there was no Google, no search engines, no
Internet, so one actually looked things up by hand. I went into the
math library and began a quick linear search of all journals that
seemed like they had anything to do with random walks. After about an
hour I found the formula we were looking for: the expected return time
was just the reciprocal of the probability of being in that state.

As soon as Dick returned from his class I showed him the formula. We
both were a bit embarrassed, since the formula was easy to prove. But
worse, it was something that we had no doubt seen before, but
forgotten. If we’d had better memory we would have proved the theorem
instantly. In any event the conjecture became a theorem, and we all
wrote up a paper together [..].

Should we stress more memorization in teaching and learning math [..]?"

Stiglitz: "[..] Pluralism and competition, often associated with
openness, are vital to innovation and the growth of knowledge. The
structure of economic and political institutions powerfully affect
which ideas, innovations, or projects are selected to be financed and
implemented [..]

Some years ago, I explored one aspect of this, in contrasting two
opposing extremes in project selection: a hierarchical system, where a
proposal must pass a series of hurdles to be accepted, or a
decentralized system of alternative decision centers, where a proposal
can be accepted by any one of them (and can get a second chance if
turned down). The hierarchical system would tend to err on the side of
rejecting many good projects while the decentralized system would err
on the side of accepting many bad projects. The advisability of the
two systems (and various mixtures) would depend on the relative cost
of accepting a project that turns out to be bad versus the opportunity
cost of rejecting a project that turned out to be good. The
hierarchical system would be best for a decision where accepting a bad
project might be fatal–as in the decision to go to war. But where
accepted bad projects are not fatal and only expend resources, the
clear verdict of history is in favor of a more decentralized system of
pluralistic political or economic units.

In a decentralized system, decision-makers compete against one another
to find good projects. With centralized or monopoly project selection,
there is no fear that a rejected innovation will be adopted by a
competitor and an accepted innovation might have an uncertain effect
on the monopoly. Thus hierarchical centralization has been a recipe
for uniform and essentially static societies from ancient Egypt to the
Soviet Union. In contrast, Columbus was turned down by the King of
Portugal and two Spanish dukes before submitting his proposal to
Ferdinand and Isabella. After a four year wait, he was again turned
down, but the decision was reversed two years later in 1492. In this
manner, the pluralistic and competing channels of selection foster
innovation"

We talked about father SJ son SP pairing, the reverse is also
possible, and in most cases if it's not tragic, a lot funnier. Imagine
a poor SJ kid who wants to be rooted, take things slow, but there is a
half-mad father running circles around him.

The most interesting example I have for this is from a Turkish
businessman; He now owns / operates a successful transportation
business, starting with a few vehicles, he built up this whole
empire. He talks about all of that, and during the interview he also
keeps mentioning his father. But he does this once, twice, .. and in
fact, so many times (by my rough count, at least twenty) that I
started probing little more. And boy, did that guy (his father) take
this poor kid for a wild ride.

The father apparently was a flim flam man who lived fast and loose,
conned some people, including his own son. The son now owns a fleet of
buses, as we said before, and he managed this feat not once, but
twice; his first fleet being completely taken away from him by his
beligerent father. He started from scratch after this mishap -again-
and rebuilding his business from nothing. So this poor guy actually
seems a bit confused by his childhood, he shows signs of of utter
disbelief at times for the hand he had been dealt with in life. But
seeing the success he is enjoying now I guess it is safe to laugh at
it -- which I did a lot during this interview.

So here it is, an example of an SP father - SJ child relationship at
its most extreme. It is extreme but it is possible, and only possible
with an SP father, or mother. Artisans like to live in the moment,
move tactically, love shiny things, drawn to adventure, might also
demonstrate a complete lack of morals, and / or ideals. I am not being
judgemental about this, SPs approach to life is simply a strategy, it
works well in some cases, and not so well in others.

Anyway, now this transportation magnate is nurturing, growing his
business, raising his own sons, one of whom comes to work with
him. When his son puts his feet up on a table at the office, he is
gently warned by his father to "not to act disrespectful in the
workplace".

The joke is now on the grandson.

We talked about the Leave the Child Behind pysch type; interestingly
both Sarkozy and Merkel are LCBs. I hear lots of complaints about both
for not being quick enough on responding to the recent EU crises, not
taking responsibility to save the European economy, etc.. Well; how
much of that can be attributed to general slowness of EU institutions,
how much is their LCB type's fault is debatable. Yet another question
is if it is even possible to have any gigantic mechanism such as the
EU (or the US) to survive the tectonic shifts caused by the 3rd
Wave. Anyhow; maybe some of the slowness has to do with their LCB.

"Developer of the programming language C and contributer to the famous
OS Unix system Dennis Ritchie has passed away. I talked my history
with the language a little bit here, and the book I was given in that
story was Ritchie's book!BTW, Unix, C and their derivaties are inside
many mobile devices, including iPhone, iPad and Android. It's funny
actually, there are some big words written on Steve Jobs these days,
such as he changed the way we live. But an equal appreciation (if not
more) needs to go to the unseen genius' whose inventions power the
devices that people hold in their hands. Unix may not be shiny, but it
is the thing that runs in the background when users click on those
buttons, and slide those icons"

"AS PROTESTS against financial power sweep the world this week, science
may have confirmed the protesters' worst fears. An analysis of the
relationships between 43,000 transnational corporations has identified
a relatively small group of companies, mainly banks, with
disproportionate power over the global economy.

The study's assumptions have attracted some criticism, but complex
systems analysts contacted by New Scientist say it is a unique effort
to untangle control in the global economy. Pushing the analysis
further, they say, could help to identify ways of making global
capitalism more stable."

Slow down cowboy.. How the hell did you jump from online education to
Ender's Game? It's really sneaky what he did there actually, "online
stuff, pah, there are lots of charlatans there", he than immediately
moves on to scifi which was not "fi" enough sadly, and uses this
backward fi, with its classroom concept, to demonstrate "we already
have that!"

You bloody idiot: Everything about postmodernity is scale-free, that
is, a single video can reach millions, in an instant, because you are
not limited to phsyical medium's copying, distributing hassles
utilizing physical paper. On an Internet-based medium, if there are
good classes, and there are many, they will reach millions, in an
instant, without the cost of copying, and distribution.

Will there be snake-oil salesman? Yes. But quality will also be
available, and because we have a scale-free medium, that quality will
be able to reach the eyes who are starved for knowledge. And the fact
that Internet medium is so open to newcomers, the chances of quality
content being made available are much higher.

Will professors be obsolete? Researchers wont be, and I dont care what
label these people carry, professor, master educator, savant,
whatever. They can make their lectures available online, for whoever
is interested.

They can even offer certification, either 1-on-1, over video, or using
automated process maybe which is prepared by them personally. Students
then acquire certification for different classes, from multiple
researchers, in different locations even, or universities. "I have
Group Theory certification from Dr. X, Linear Algebra certification
from Dr. Y, ..". How cool would that be?

If any profession is to be obsolete, that is the dumb transmitter, the
repeater, the weakest link in the chain, which is the average teacher.

""Educational institutions are under stress worldwide both from
economic and technological factors. [..] The online education boom is
producing the usual mix of stunning innovation and snake-oil
charlatans. [..] What does science fiction have to say about the
future of education? [..] Consider Battle School in Orson Scott Card's
Ender's Game, the concents in Neal Stephenson's Anathem [..]"
