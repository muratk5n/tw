# Week 32

Interesting tidbit on the Norwegian mathematician Abel shared by
Arthur Mattuck of MIT: he apparently had a tragic life, he made many
discoveries but in his lifetime, they were not recognized. Now he is a
national icon in Norway, there is a huge statue of him in Oslo: but
the joke is, since noone knew what he looked like, they made the
statue so big that you cannot see his face when you are near it.

Yes, Stanford, as well as MIT (through OCW initiative) already make
video lectures available to everyone over the Internet. Ng's class
goes one step further: During Fall of 2011 anyone in the world will be
able to follow and to a degree, participate in this class. Very cool.

What is taught in ML class? Let me summarize this way: if one day
Skynet took over the world and a robot with an Austrian accent kicked
your ass, this is the class you should blame. Joking aside, ML is
about teaching machines how to learn. I sometimes call the methods and
algorithms used here as "machine scientists" because frequently what
ML researchers end up doing is teaching machines how to model
mathematically / automatically. Modeling is science's main tool for
making sense of nature's data obviously.

"A bold experiment in distributed education, "Machine Learning
[class]" will be offered free and online to students worldwide during
the fall of 2011. Students will have access to lecture videos, lecture
notes, receive regular feedback on progress, and receive answers to
questions. When you successfully complete the class, you will also
receive a statement of accomplishment. Taught by Professor Andrew Ng,
the curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Machine Learning course."

Jeremy Clarkson: "How come every other city in the world staged a
pretty good riot [except the British?] To understand why the British
are so hopeless at getting off their backsides, we need to go back to
the summer of 1381 and the so-called Peasants’ Revolt. A mob, seeking
equality for all, had sacked London. They had burnt the houses of the
rich, beheaded anyone dressed in velvet, opened prisons, drunk John of
Gaunt’s wine and scattered financial records to the four winds [..]

Ten days later, the rebels confronted the king who told them: ‘You
wretches, detestable on land and sea; you who seek equality with lords
are unworthy to live.’ So they all went home. How come? What was it
that extinguished the fire in their bellies? Well, I have no proof of
this because nobody was keeping meteorological records in the
fourteenth century but I’d like to bet that it started to rain.

A lot of people with vast foreheads have, over the years, wondered why
Britain has never had a successful uprising. Some say it’s because the
monarchy was too powerful. Others argue that you can’t have a
revolution if you have a strong and contented middle class.

Pah. I say it’s because of the drizzle. Last year’s May Day riot was a
success because it was dry and quite warm. This one was a washout
because it rained and we are brought up on a diet of party invitations
that always say ‘If wet, in the village hall’. And you can’t change
the fabric of society from a venue that’s also used for parish council
meetings and line dancing.

There is some evidence to back up this theory. The night of 11 April
1981 was dry and unseasonably warm. I know this because it was my
twenty-first birthday. It was also the night of the Brixton
riots. Aha, you might say, but what about the Russian Revolution? They
also have rubbish weather so how did they get it together? Well, look
at the dates. It began in early spring and it was all over by
October. And when did the French storm the Bastille? It was 14 July.

Here’s a thought: the only reason why the Arabs and Jews have managed
to keep their nasty little war going for 50 years is because it never
bloody rains. If the post-war powers had put Israel in Manchester,
there’d have been no bloodshed at all."

Paul Graham: "I've never been 100% sure whether patents help or hinder
technological progress. When I was a kid I thought they helped. I
thought they protected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big
companies. Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were
physical. But regardless of whether patents are in general a good
thing, there do seem to be bad ways of using them. And since bad uses
of patents seem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for
patent reform"

"Movement is not expensive if the environment is set up to support
it. I am not an extremist or minimalist. I don’t want to be living off
a few packs on a bicycle for the rest of my life. I like warm beds,
hot showers and large, well-equipped kitchens as much as anybody
else. I like having access to lots of useful things like washing
machines and gyms. It is not inconceivable that the world could be
arranged to provide all these in a way that supports both rootedness
and nomadism. Thanks to online friendships, and emerging
infrastructure around couchsurfing and companies like Airbnb, it is
becoming easier every year. I’d like to see trains getting cheaper,
tent-living becoming available for the non-destitute classes, health
insurance becoming more portable, public toilets acquiring shower
stalls, and government identity documents becoming anchored to
something other than physical addresses. I’d like to see the
time-share concept expand beyond vacations to regular living. I’d like
executive suites and coworking spaces sprout up all over, and acquire
cheap bedrooms that you can live out of. I’d like to be able to rent
nap-pods at Starbucks. I’d rather own or rent a twelfth of a home in
twelve cities than one home in one city.

There is no necessary either-or between nomadism and rooted
living. Technology has evolved to the point where the apparatus of the
state should be able to accommodate illegible people without pinning
them down"

Gleick's Genius: "Feynman had developed an appetite for new
problems—any problems. He would stop people he knew in the corridor of
the physics building and ask what they were working on. They quickly
discovered that the question was not the usual small talk. Feynman
pushed for details. He caught one classmate, Monarch Cutler, in
despair. Cutler had taken on a senior thesis problem based on an
important discovery in 1938 by two professors in the optics
laboratory. They found that they could transform the refracting and
reflecting qualities of lenses by evaporating salts onto them, forming
very thin coatings, just a few atoms thick. Such coatings became
essential to reducing unwanted glare in the lenses of cameras and
telescopes. Cutler was supposed to find a way of calculating what
happened when different thin films were applied, one atop another. His
professors wondered, for example, whether there was a way to make
exceedingly pure color filters, passing only light of a certain
wavelength. Cutler was stymied. Classical optics should have
sufficed—no peculiarly quantum effects came into play—but no one had
ever analyzed the behavior of light passing through a parade of mostly
transparent films thinner than a single wavelength.

Cutler told Feynman he could find no literature on the subject. He did
not know where to start. A few days later Feynman returned with the
solution: a formula summing an infinite series of reflections back and
forth from the inner surfaces of the coatings. He showed how the
combinations of refraction and reflection would affect the phase of
the light, changing its color. Using Feynman’s theory and many hours
on the Marchant calculator, Cutler also found a way to make the color
filters his professors wanted. Developing a theory for reflection by
multiple-layer thin films was not so different for Feynman from math
team in the now-distant past of Far Rockaway. He could see, or feel,
the intertwined infinities of the problem, the beam of light
resonating back and forth between the pair of surfaces, and then the
next pair, and so on, and he had a giant mental kit bag of formulas to
try out. Even when he was fourteen he had manipulated series of
continued fractions the way a pianist practices scales. Now he had an
intuition for the translating of formulas into physics and back, a
feeling for the rhythms or the spaces or the forces that a given set
of symbols implied".

Mumford is one of the perfect people to write about this; not only
does he deal with theory, but he also deals with applications, and he
is someone who will go beyond tradiational applications such as
mechanics and physics. I know him through his work in image
processing; there is the famous Mumford-Shah functional that everyone
who uses partial differential equations in vision will come across one
way or another. Functionals are 18th century math going back to Euler,
and image processing is a field so new that it did not exist 50 years
ago -- so Mumford knows what he is talking about. This view needs to
be taken into consideration.

Mumford and Garfunkel: "There is widespread alarm in the United States
about the state of our math education.[..] The truth is that different
sets of math skills are useful for different careers, and our math
education should be changed to reflect this fact.

A math curriculum that focused on real-life problems would still
expose students to the abstract tools of mathematics, especially the
manipulation of unknown quantities. But there is a world of difference
between teaching “pure” math, with no context, and teaching relevant
problems that will lead students to appreciate how a mathematical
formula models and clarifies real-world situations [..]

Imagine replacing the sequence of algebra, geometry and calculus with
a sequence of finance, data and basic engineering. In the finance
course, students would learn the exponential function, use formulas in
spreadsheets and study the budgets of people, companies and
governments. In the data course, students would gather their own data
sets and learn how, in fields as diverse as sports and medicine,
larger samples give better estimates of averages. In the basic
engineering course, students would learn the workings of engines,
sound waves, TV signals and computers. Science and math were
originally discovered together, and they are best learned together
now.

Traditionalists will object that the standard curriculum teaches
valuable abstract reasoning, even if the specific skills acquired are
not immediately useful in later life. A generation ago,
traditionalists were also arguing that studying Latin, though it had
no practical application, helped students develop unique linguistic
skills. We believe that studying applied math, like learning living
languages, provides both useable knowledge and abstract skills"

From The World According to Clarkson: "[Mandela] is not Gandhi, you
know. You may like what he represents – I do – but if you peer under
the halo of political correctness that bathes him in a golden glow of
goodness you’ll find that the man himself is a bit dodgy.

Back in the early 1960s he was the one who pushed the ANC into armed
conflict. He was known back then as the Black Pimpernel. And his
second marriage was to Winnie, who’s now a convicted fraudster and
thief with, we’re told, a penchant for Pirelli necklaces.

Furthermore, since his release from prison and his eventual rise to
the presidency Mandela has had some extraordinary things to say about
world affairs. He’s deeply concerned, for instance, about the plight
of one of the Lockerbie bombers and has expressed support for both
Gadaffi and Castro. Indeed, he has singled out Cuba, praising it for
its human rights and liberty. I’m sorry – what human rights, what
liberty? [..]"

For Lenin and the Russian revolutionaries, the big question was “Kto
kogo?” — essentially, “Who has the upper hand?”

Kto kogo remains the paradigm at the center of the fiscal battles
roiling the Western world: young vs. old; rich taxpayers vs. poor
welfare beneficiaries; public sector workers vs. private sector ones;
wealthy Northern Europe vs. bankrupt Southern Europe; small government
conservatives vs. big government liberals.

Ross Douthat: "For months, he’s positioned himself near the center of
public opinion, leaving Republicans to occupy the rightward flank [..]
Yet the president’s approval ratings have been sinking steadily for
weeks, hitting a George W. Bush-esque low of 40 percent [..] The
administration would no doubt blame this judgment on the steady stream
of miserable economic news. But it should save some of the blame for
its own political approach. Ever since the midterms, the White House’s
tactics have consistently maximized President Obama’s short-term
advantage while diminishing his overall authority. Call it the “too
clever by half” presidency: the administration’s maneuvering keeps
working out as planned, but Obama’s position keeps eroding"

"It is interesing to note that right that after 9/11, first
best-selling story / viewpoint in US did not include a mad furor about
Islam, Middle-East, but it involved the Catholic Church, Renaissance,
and Medieval knights. Surely it did involve religion, but not Islam. I
am talking about the Da Vinci Code stories of course which brilliantly
tapped into a nation's psyche, its cultural fault line. DVC after 9/11
attacks reminded people about something they were familiar with: the
dictatorial mentality of Rome (or the Roman Catholic Church), and its
top-down hold on religion, knowledge and its symbols. The Western
world already had that fight; Geiseric, who destroyed the Romans was
seen a barbarian after all, he was a Christian whose only difference
from the Catholic "party line" was his belief that Jesus was not God.

If the "bad" in the story is Roman Catholics, then the "good" could
only have been something Medieval, and it was. Enter Templar "Knights"
whose job is to protect "the secret", the holy grail,
whatever. Knights belong to an era after Romans' fall, and the fall of
modernity today ushering in an era similar to Medieval Age is the
parallel here, that's why the knight as a symbol still "sells" in
movies, either in its original form, or in an endless stream of
superhero pictures. Iron Man? He has an armor, has a fief (his hi-tech
house), has squires (his little robots), is against Military
Industrial Complex (modern Rome).

In any case: DVC book and the movies are on code, the code being the
dividing line between Rome / Jesus, militarism / piece, mindless
centurion vs. the knight"

"[Feynman ..] much later, having settled into a domestic existence
complete with garden and porch, taught himself how to train dogs to do
counterintuitive tricks for example, to pick up a nearby sock not by
the direct route but by the long way round, circling through the
garden, in the porch door and back out again. (He did the training in
stages, breaking the problem down until after a while it was perfectly
obvious to the dog that one did not go directly to the sock.)"

I am having some fun with these.. It started with quid-pro-bro,
brocassion, bromance; now there is an entire dictionary about this
stuff. They are 'broisms'. Some other ones:

Brofessional: A dude who has devoted himself fully to bro
activities. Obviously this includes beer drinking, playing videogames,
etc.

Broverload: Anytime someone feels uncomfortable with the number of
bros in a confined space.

Brogrammer: A bro who somehow learned to program, but would deny it in
any social situation.

Broller Coaster: a roller coaster full of obnoxious bro's that scream
excessively even when the ride has come to a full stop.

Brotein: What bros drink in order to become more attractive towards
other bro hoes.

Brolitude: When one decides on something consisting of only him and
his bros.

Brocean: A collection of bros. It is ruled by broseidon, and most of
its citizens have quality flow and play lax.
