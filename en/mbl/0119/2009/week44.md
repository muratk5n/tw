# Week 44

There is a lot of talk on this subject: that technology so rising in
complexity, with dazzling applications that at one point, some form of
AI will surpass human intelligence. This view was exemplified by an
early pioneer in robotics research. He said (I paraphrase) "I believe
the day will come an AI capable robot will look down to a human as we
look down a dog. And I confess, I am rooting for the machines".

Ok. A bit rough but, there it is.

Working with robotics and seeing the algorithms, methods used, I can
say that this event in fact is plausible. Technology can get
there. Then (let's rationalize all of this) could we perhaps see this
AI as an "evolution" of ourselves, that our growth is actually leading
us this way? Great, I feel better now. The robot is me! Only better.

But evolution can also go in another direction: in a way that'll
result in a human being evolved in such a way that can interface with
a computer so efficiently that this 'combination' will never let any
kind of singularity event come to fore. Or, make it uncessary.

I believe this is a more likely scenario. We love our tools. Even
without a Matrix like plug-in, we get so good interfacing to our tools
through our "old-fashioned" "limbs" that some feel whatever tool they
use becomes an extension of them. If we can do this, what is stopping
us fusing ourselves so well with a computer that can do all heavy
lifting while we concentrate on more "human" tasks? This interfacing
ability would get inherited and 'chosen' through successive evoution
and become stronger, more effective.

So I am not 'scared' in any way. Just the fact that we are talking
about this today will assure it happening less likely. Sure some crazy
scientist can work on a T-4000000 complete with an Austrian accent and
let it loose on humans, but this all comes back to MAD rationale
again. Why use a technology when in some day it might come back and
bite you in the ass? I don't think so.

We are safe. Sleep soundly humans.
