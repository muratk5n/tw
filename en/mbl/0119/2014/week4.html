<p>"This year will mark another key milestone in self-driving 
technology. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
is widely expected to announce standards and mandates for car-borne 
beacons that will broadcast location information to other vehicles on 
the road. The beacons will warn drivers when a collision seems 
imminent—when the car ahead breaks hard, for example, or another vehicle
 swerves erratically into traffic. Automakers may then use this 
information to take the next step: program automated responses"</p>

<p>A 5 megabyte IBM hard disk is loaded into an airplane. It weighed over
1000kg, year 1956.</p>
<p>5 Megabytes! </p>
<p>People wonder where the jobs have gone. If we bring back 5 MB hard drive that weighs a ton, maybe we could create more jobs. There are 6 people standing around right there while that thing is being loaded onto the plane. </p>
