President by Day Vampire Hunter by Night

I cannot stop laughing whenever I hear something about this movie;
*Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter*. Hillarious concept, outrageously
stupid, but it's fun to talk about -- in a laugh-at-it kind of
way. Coincidentally, we had blogged about this before, down to the
president's name that is being paraded through in this movie.

And of course, someone had to go ahead and make this:

I was like "Ibrahim?", why not "Hussein?"; Then I remember the name
Ibrahim is "turban-speak" for Abraham.

Very, very funny..
