<p>Talked about one this second wave mentality here. Concentration,
maximization disproportionatelly inflates companies, people, egos,
wallets, creates a fragile state for everyone involved in the
system. No single person should be in a position to lose this amount
of money. Obviously as a solution we do not imply more regulation, but
another decentralized system that directs investment to places where
it is needed.</p>

loss, which could bloat to as much as $4 billion in the coming weeks,
critics of Wall Street have pressed the government to strengthen its
oversight of the financial industry. But would that be enough to
prevent a repetition of the financial crisis? Some say the very
existence of JPMorgan and other too-big-to-fail banks represents a
constant threat to the global economy"</p>
