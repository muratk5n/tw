# Week 44

"Amber Lambke and Allan Grinshtein start[ed] a group called the
New York Nightowls, a sort of study hall for entrepreneurs,
freelancers and software developers who gather at 10 every Tuesday
night and stay as late as 4 a.m.  “The goal is to come, get inspired,
meet new people and get work done,” said Ms. Lambke, a creative
consultant. “It’s six hours of uninterrupted, productive time where
you’re surrounded by other creative people doing awesome things.”
Although the New York group has been meeting only since April, the
concept is catching on.  [..] Participants say a spirit of
collaboration and camaraderie percolates through the night, one that
can be hard to come by during normal working hours [..].One big
advantage of the late-night hours is that they are blissfully free of
the distractions that clutter the daytime.

Even the Web goes quiet. [..] “When you don’t have your co-workers
constantly interrupting you, fewer friends bored at work and on IM,
it’s easier to get things done,” said Montana Low, a scientist.Yet
another example of working habits, and the concept of work
changing. People are finding it increasingly hard to work during
regular hours, in regular offices, so instead, they form a group to
work at night. But when we look at this structurally, people are
working outside of work, it's obvious we have a serious problem. The
system is wasting time and money by placing people into "work areas"
with "people they do not want to be around with", making the option of
going outside the system more tempting.We do not live in an industrial
world anymore. People dont have to be "near unmovable things" such as
factory machinery to be productive. Just like old style journalism,
education, and politics collapse due to changes in production, the
concept of work is also being redefined"

Note: There was an interesting dynamic around "cities" in TSN. As Paul
Graham says, "[i]n a hundred subtle ways, [every] city sends you a
message". New York tells you, above all: you should make more money,
Boston (or Cambridge) says you should be smarter, Silicon Valley says:
you should be more powerful. In TSN we saw a back-and-forth between
all the above. FB CFO wanted to remain in NY (money), Zuckerberg did
not agree. Zuckerberg "did not care about the money", and he says at
one point in the movie that "people in Harvard were not impressed by
money (because the message in Cambridge is about smarts, not
money). Shawn Fanning in contrast is all about power. He talks about
"bringing down music companies", wants Facebook to have "more users,
reach all continents".

Eventually Zuckerberg finds himself closer to this and moves to West
Coast.

Good movie... But the nagging question in my mind before and after the
movie was "how much of it was actually correct?".

I believe there is a "good chance" that TSN captured the spirit of the
Facebook story. How can we know this? Well, there are key moments that
had to researched carefully, and had to be as close to truth as
possible. For example the email correspondance between Winklevoss
brothers (played by the same actor by the way) and Mark Zuckerberg
cannot be faked. There has been a settlement between Winklevoss
brothers and Zuckerberg, also between FB CFO Saverin, these are
FACTS. Therefore starting from these data points you can project, then
you watch videos of Zuckerberg, talking, giving speeches, and you can
paint a pretty good picture of the kid. Surely the movie took certain
liberties while trying to entertain, but these can be glossed over by
the viewer while enjoying the movie.

TSN was fair to its characters. Also, in legal terms the settlement
between Winklevoss bros and Zuckerberg has been FAIR in real
life. Z. did after all steal their ideas a little; of course without
Zuckerberg there would be no Facebook, but without that spark he
received from W. brothers, Facebook might not have been Facebook as we
know it either.

Overall, the Z. picture coming out TSN is a bright kid who wants to
grow his product / creation at all costs. That is commendable. A
business card that says "I am CEO bitch" is not that important,
really. It's a joke, I could make a similar joke myself -- and you
cannot create a whole evil empire image based on this little
soundbite. Of course FB needs to be careful about privacy issues, but
that is true for every company that handles your information,
including credit card companies.

I liked the techno-speak, it's nice to hear such familiar words in a
movie setting (Emacs rules!).

Great acting all around, Eisenberg, Timberlake did a fine job.

Obama got what he deserved. After his big election win in 2008, he had
to push for bigger changes, and when faced with resistence, take the
fight to the populace, labeling the other side as "the ones stopping
the change", and watch things develop from there.

Instead, what we got since 2008 has a meager health-care bill, meager
reforms in economy, coupled with an utter inability to dissect what is
wrong with education establishment. Oh, also some very odd comments
about "saving newspapers' who are dinaseurs of the (previous) modern
age.

---

Maybe there is a psychological block preventing Obama becoming the
reformer he promised to be on the 2008 campaign trail. It's because he
is black.

Hold your horses: this was no racist comment.

What I am saying is, as the first black president Obama might be
thinking he is "representing", and if he fails, fails big, people will
think it was "because he was black". So, he is not taking big steps,
preventing big fail, but not accomplishing much, following pretty much
other white men as an example that came before him. That's why we had
a Clinton era economist, Bush era defense secretary, Clinton-era,
well.. Clinton on the White House. Obama became an eclectic mix of
white people before him, and this way, he guaranteed he would not be
any worse than a white man.

But white or black, brown or yellow, the reality remains: We are going
through changes that no person in any color has witnessed
before. Americans elected Obama to do things different. If he fails, I
am afraid he will not be a two-term president. But maybe, that's
enough for him.

After all, it's no worse than a white man.

In the movie Armageddon we had a giant meteor coming to Earth,
threathening to devastate life as we know it. The movie's answer to
this problem was to send Bruce Willis to the said rock so he could
blow it up.But scifi needs to get little more "sci", less "fi" and do
little more research on these asteroid flicks. We need to understand
that it takes an huge amount of energy for a large object to travel
through space. Yes, yes, it has happened before; a giant meteor
destroyed dinasaurs, which indirectly, allowed humans to evolve and
come to its present form, bla bla. Right.But lesser known fact is how
that meteor got here; it followed a route in space called the
Interplanetary Superhighway (IPS).This is a relatively new finding in
space research. Due to development in nonlinear dynamics, and the
solution of the (restricted) three-body problem, we know that in the
chaos (as in chaos theory) of gravity fields, certain "points" and
"routes" exist that can act as steady points, and / or routes that
take you NEAR ZERO ENERGY to travel through. That is, once you propel
yourself with a big enough burst, you will fly through them as if you
are in some kind of man made tube in space.That is how the giant
meteor millions of years ago could reach Earth. It followed one of
these "easy" routes through space. Then the message to makers of
meteor-comes-to-Earth type of flicks is this:YOU DONT HAVE TO BLOW
SHIT UP.If Armageddon script writers did little more research, they
would know that you could simply "nudge" the rock to park it in one of
the so-called "Lagrange points". These points are steady, and once you
are in them, you stay there. Why would we want to "destroy" meteors
anyway? We could mine them for metals and minerals. They are no
danger, they are a big opportunity!IPS is no simple dream theory -- it
has been in actual use.  NASA Genesis mission used IPS to travel
around Sun / Earth, and the same math managed to save Japanese Hiten
Lunar mission.Discovery, National Geographic: A program on IPS would
be nice.More details below.Ed BelbrunoMartin Lo Paper [PDF]Wikipedia

More from Jones and Romer

As just one example, recall that the increasing returns to scale that
is implied by nonrivalry leads to the failure of Adam Smith’s famous
invisible hand result. The institutions of complete property rights
and perfect competition that work so well in a world consisting solely
of rival goods no longer deliver the optimal allocation of resources
in a world containing ideas. Efficiency in use dictates price equal to
marginal cost. But with increasing returns, there is insufficient
output to pay each input its marginal product; in general, price must
exceed marginal cost somewhere to provide the incentive for profit
maximizing private firms to create new ideas.1 This tension is at the
heart of the problem: a single price cannot simultaneously allocate
goods to their most efficient uses and provide the appropriate
incentives for innovation.

An important unresolved policy question is therefore the optimal
design of institutions that support the production and distribution of
nonrival ideas. In practice, most observers seem to agree that some
complicated mix of secrecy, intellectual property rights that convey
partial excludability, public subsidies through the institutions of
science, and private voluntary provision is more efficient than any
corner solution like that prescribed for rival goods. We are, however,
very far from results we could derive from first principles to guide
decisions about which types of goods are best served by which
institutional arrangement.

I've been thinking about this for some time; the tension between
sharing for public good, and incentivizing sharing of profitable ideas
through a patent structure (and determining whether this is even
enforcable in the near future) is a tough nut to crack.

Also education: today education provides many tasks at once, educating
and providing credentials at the same time -- but articles such as
this makes one think we are failing at that front too. Insant
communication, and the availability of information allowed the rise of
"knowledge mercenaries" who provide homework solutions, master's, even
PhD thesis' in not-so-average universities.

This article is written by one such mercenary; basically for
non-mathematical subjects, this guy takes your assignment (and money),
sits down, Googles like crazy, and writes you a paper on a subject of
your choosing.

There is a lot of work to do.

I see fools berating Wikileaks for releasing this much
information. There is no need to worry. The Third Wave is coming,
information, data wants to be free and will be free. There is nothing
anyone can do about it.

Learn to like it.

Love it.

In order to manage this fast-paced, subsecond world we live in, we
need more, not less data. "Oh but won't we be overwhelmed by a lot of
data?". No you wont. Filters will develop, new techologies will spring
up that you've never thought of. to handle this data overflow. Human
society as a whole is a big whopping information processing machine.

One can argue that one of the reasons of 2008 crisis is we did not
have enough data on the economy. If we knew every trade, every
position, every detail about the economy, companies, one could develop
monitoring software to sift through the data, raise alarms and report
realtime.

My job was / is processing data in all forms; and I am telling you,
more data is preferable.

So naysayers need to shut the fuck up and smell the coffee.

Protestant Reformation [had an] emphasis upon individualism, literacy
and the patriarchal nuclear family, and the Enlightenment, with its
emphasis upon rationality, faith in human progress, the development of
the scientific method, etc. The period of modernity was characterized
by a high degree of centralization of control of production,
increasingly large scale capitalization of industry, and a high degree
of routinization and standardization of products and
processes. Modernity reaches one of its high points of development in
the industrial practices of "Taylorism" (follow this link for a Wall
Street Journal backgrounder on Taylorism archived on the Cool Fire
Technology site) in which the worker's actions are segmented and
standardized, effectively making each worker interchangeable, and
"Fordism" (follow this link for Ruppert's account of Fordism by Mark
Ruppert of Syracuse University) which adds to Taylorism a systematic
attempt to control the workers' off-the-job life as well--hence Ford's
planned communities, housing, control of media, adult education, etc

Does modernity = individualism? Short answer: No.

As it is stressed in the passage above, individualism has its roots in
the Enlightement, but Modernity has to do with industrial production,
Taylorism, Fordism.

Marxist literature does equate modernity with individualism but
.. Marxists are morons. An obviously failed ideology cannot be used as
a measuring stick for all other ideologies. Right?

In the post-modern, electronic cottage world we are living now,
individuals have a tremendous amount of computing power, means of
communication, and means of organizing, creating knowledge. This is
real power and is the basis of all the changes we are seeing across
the world today.

Mathematics Is Smarter Than I Am.

A mathematics professor uttered this sentence the other day, and is
absolutely correct. I had trouble explaining this to people, but
thanks to him, I have the right words now.

Mathematics is not a collection of symbols so you can "show off" how
smart you are to your friends.

Mathematics is a technology. It helps you do things you would never be
able to otherwise.

How does it work? Well, the "internal smarts" of mathematics comes
from its collection of theories, rules, etc. While we are developing a
model, the moment we connect our thinking with one of these prepared
rules, we are getting something for free. These premade rules might
take us to different form (using other rules) let us simplify things,
and finally we reach a clean computational stop. These rules,
statements that form the internal smarts are easier to remember than
going back, say to number theory, and / or computing the first,
obvious thing you see in front of you (the worst you can do in any
problem is trying all solutions).

One of my teachers used to say "when you are stuck, just write
something you know is true".

That is, take a mathematical statement out of your bag, write it down,
and try to connect it with your problem. Try to find that entry point
to the "internal smarts" of mathematics.

Jason Fried: Why work doesn't happen at work

It is no secret that China owes a lot to Alvin Toffler. The official
newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, People's Daily, classed him
among the 50 foreigners who shaped modern China. But how did the
Chinese follow Toffler's advice exactly?

Here is what they did: they took The Third Wave, and did everything
Toffler said to not do.

My thesis is, Chinese learned industrialization from Toffler, he was
describing the ills of modernity but Chinese were learning what
modernity was all about from him. Among the pages of TW, the Chinese
saw the industrialization process for what it is; a centralized,
standardized, concentrated style of living, working, and most
importantly governing. It was a match made in heaven -- Communist
Party could still maintain its control while industrializing a nation.

But all of this had to take place in 19oos. Chinese were late to the
party; they had to do all of this "late development" in a world of
computers, the Internet, and cellular networks -- increasingly so
after 1990s.

That is the main reason why Chinese politics and economy is the hybrid
beast that it is today. Capitalism with no law, local democracy no
national elections, and a slogan "pieceful rise" that is tantamount to
oxymoron in international affairs. The reason for this mixed bag is
you can only be Second Wave if you block certain parts of the economy
to investment, to competition, to outside and internal "free
forces". You produce, but dont consume, you get free enterprise only
in parts of the economy geared for export. You have cheap labor, you
export like crazy while insulating yourself from stuff that you dont
want.

Looking at this picture, one can conclude China is nowhere near its
final destination. It knows this very well because they understood
those parts of TW as well.

Paul Romer has been talking about this for quite a while; and I like
the idea. In some countries cities are very badly managed, and
starting from scratch, in a carefully managed manner is a great
idea. If we are entering (or, already in) an age of
hyper-customization, it should be no surprise that the most important
aspect of our life, the city we live in, can be customized to our
needs. I imagine different "types" of communities around newly built
charter cities mushroom all around the globe. One city might have a
"single, scientists city" theme, another "married sports freak city"
theme, and each could have buildings, structures, people that are
appropiate for them. Entry requirements for each city would reflect
their corresponding themes. I dont like to be around children,
constant crying, screaming pisses me off, so I should be able to
choose a city where there isnt a single child in sight. I dont give a
flying fuck about historical buildings either, so a city with none
would be a boon for me.

I hear of countries building such cities, such as in South Korea, and
Hamburg; I could see myself moving to one of these cities if they
mature enough, with lots of people in them.
