<h1>Week 28</h1>
<p><em>Idiocracy</em>. Hillarious movie. It talks about a future (500 years
later) when hedonism is the rule of the day, extreme violence as
entertainment is commonplace, and events resembling Gladiator fights
in Rome are widely followed and celebrated.</p>
<p>People are basically idiots who cannot even perform simple arithmetic
in their heads. Obviously, Idiocracy takes some of today's social
problems, and projects some in to the future. In smaller scale, we are
actually living in the world pictured in Idiocracy. Some jokes were
really funny; Someone from 2006 is transported into the future, and
there, he is constantly made fun of for talking "like a fag (he talks
normally)" -- basically anyone smart in this world "sounds like a
fag". In one scene, someone mocks our guy "look, you talk just like
this [mocks him]", and another guy in earshot pops in on the screen
and says "oh sorry, I really thought there were two of you there for a
while". Another one: The President of United States is called "Dwayne
Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho" and is a former wrestler.</p>
<p>Crazy shit. I loved it.</p>
