<p>Don't get me started on LLM tech, they are <em>all</em> about adjustable
parameters, a modern LLM has over 1.5 <em>trillion</em> of them. Imagine the
level of ignorance captured in that design decision. We basically know
next to nothing about intelligence, we just reverse engineered some
parameters from data via a black box, and called it AI.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now we reveal where the data comes from: it is the <strong>SINE FUNCTION</strong>
(with some added noise to make it look like experimental data).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">df['ypred'] = np.sin(df.index)
df.plot(grid=True)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="mbl/2026/img/freepar4.jpg">Graph</a></p>
<p>The sine function, $y = sin(x)$, has no free parameters. It is
simpler, even faster to compute. However it requires the knowledge of
trigonometry. Because the foolish scientist did not know this, his
formulation became parameter heavy. The model with a lot of adjustable
knobs represented his ignorance.</p>
<hr />
<p>But the 7 coefficients tell us nothing in scientific terms because
using the same coefficients / free parameters / "constants" approach I
could turn the curve into a line, I could make it go up, or down. The
structure of my "flexible (too flexible)" formulation doesn't tell me
anything about the phenomena. Those free parameters represent our
<em>ignorance</em>, not knowledge.</p>
<hr />
<p>Then the genius says "I can reverse engineer those adjustable knobs
from data!". He uses <code>polyfit</code>, and voila</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">coef = np.polyfit(df.index, df.ydata, degree)
df['ypred'] = np.polyval(coef,df.index)
df.plot(grid=True)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="mbl/2026/img/freepar3.jpg">Graph</a></p>
<p>That is a good fit</p>
<hr />
<p>He pulls some numbers out of his ass,</p>
<p>$c_0 = -0.00003$,$c_1=-0.00001$,$c_2=0.004$,$c_3=0.0003$,$c_4=-0.12$,
$c_5=-0.005$,$c_6=0.4$,$c_7=0.04$</p>
<p>.. and uses them,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">degree = 7
coef = [-0.00003,-0.00001,0.004,0.0003,-0.12,-0.005,0.4,0.04]
df['ypred'] = np.polyval(coef,df.index)
df.plot(grid=True)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="mbl/2026/img/freepar2.jpg">Graph</a></p>
<p>He obtains the graph above. His "prediction" came close in some
places, though overall not great.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'll give an example. Let's say a scientist is looking at some data
collected from nature,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">df = u.data_synth_1()
df.plot(grid=True)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="mbl/2026/img/freepar1.jpg">Graph</a></p>
<p>And he is asked to find the formulation for this. He looks at the data
and says, "well I can represent this by simply multiplying powers of
$x$ with some coefficients", eg $c_0 x + c_1 x^2 + ... + c_n x^n$. He
thinks he is smart because you can represent any curve with such a
function.</p>
<hr />
<p>Smolin and Unzicker are right.. the "constants" or "free parameters"
represent our ultimate ignorance about the world. Those parameters are
basically knobs you can turn to make our formulas "fit" the
experimental data.  They are reverse engineered from data, they do not
arise from fundamental mathematical deduction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Unzicker: "Cosmology’s 'concordance model' uses six numbers, which are
called 'free parameters' because they cannot be explained within the
model but rather are fitted to the measurements.  The standard model
of particle physics needs not only six of them, but an impressive
17. Why 17?.. In the 1950s, a boom of particle accelerators started
producing hundreds of elementary particles with spectacular
collisions. In the following decades, particle physics has been busy
classifying this zoo and reducing its mathematical description to
'only' 17 parameters. A few Nobel prizes have even been handed out
because of this work. But should we be convinced that we have come to
understand the ultimate structure of matter? In his book <em>The Trouble
with Physics</em>, Lee Smolin comments on the 17 free parameters. 'The
fact that there are that many freely specifiable constants in what is
supposed to be a fundamental theory is a tremendous embarrassment.'"</p>

<p>From a European perspective, a central problem with 'liberal middle'
Democrats is that they would simply restore the very conditions that
enabled the rise of the far right in the US - so I don't think it's a
question of the socialist left continuing to be marginalised for
another half-century.  If the Democrats succeed in getting elected, in
their current form, and subsequently in office fail to change key
fundamentals - such as ending American oligarchy and materially
raising working people's living standards - then the far right will
simply flood back again in 5 or 10 years."</p>

<p>LBJ, Texas oil interests, and rogue CIA elements - institutionally
they were not involved. Nothing deep, all on the surface</p>
<hr />
<p>Roger Stone, <em>The Man Who Killed Kennedy</em>: "The JFK assassination
itself became the most prime example of LBJ’s black magic. Johnson was
within days of not just being dropped from the 1964 Democratic ticket,
but of being politically executed, personally destroyed, and publicly
humiliated by the Kennedys. A Life magazine exposé on LBJ’s corruption
and vast wealth was due to be published within a week. A SWAT team of
reporters was combing through LBJ’s financial transactions in central
Texas. At the very moment when JFK’s Dallas motorcade was slowing on
Elm Street, Don Reynolds was testifying to a closed session of the
Senate Rules Committee about LBJ’s kickbacks and corruption.</p>
<p>Then presto! Magically, mysteriously, and tragically, John Kennedy is
dead. Lyndon Johnson becomes president, and the media exposés and
Senate investigation into LBJ’s corruption are deep-sixed. This was
not without the help of H. L. Hunt and the Texas oil industry, which
helped navigate, fund, and advise Johnson’s career in exchange for
prized government contracts and favorable legislation. The oil magnate
would later be one of the top financiers of the assassination in
Dallas."</p>

outbid everybody else, drive up asset prices, and when it's something
people can't live without, like a home, force them to pay unreasonable
rents - further increasing inequality, both directly and indirectly,
by sucking money out of local economies into elite enclaves."</p>

<p>No, Xi is not a minor princeling. Other princelings tend to be sons,
nephews of a Mao general, but generals are dime a dozen. Xi's father
did no one else could, he gave the Red Army refuge when they were down
on their knees, in a bad shape, facing certain ruin. Xi Zhongxun saved
them. IMO that makes his son one of the top princelings.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is interesting China, despite living under a system that enforced
equality for many years, still has an informal pseudo-royalty ranking

interest, why not pass that interest along to the customer who holds

comfort, they lobbied heavily against the crypto bill and managed to
kill it. They had a clause inserted discouraging yield offerings which
negated a big purpose of the bill.</p>

<hr />
<p>Inalcik found acceptance in the West (esp. Uni. of Chicago); migration
theories that favored <a href="../../2020/07/migrations-anatolia.html">one migration over others</a>
as an ideology was useful for the Anglo. By placing him on a pedestal
they encouraged an army of followers to continue his
research. Remember the nationalist narrative has an "alien" Turk who
arrives Asia Minor, builds civilisation where non existed, later
backstabbed by bad Arabs (don't like them, stay away from their
region), and always try to reconnect with distant cousins in Asia
(stirring shit up in Russia and China's backyard).</p>
<hr />
<p>Koprulu, Inalcik made a lot of mistakes.. But they were "useful",
that's why they were "state sponsored historians". Inalcik's student
Ortayli, though not as bright as his elders, found some renown in
local nationalist circles. They help advancing the nationalist project
of 1923. But, like Giordano Bruno said "if the first button of a man's
coat is wrongly buttoned, all the rest are sure to be crooked.". That
has always been the problem of the TR project, their initial mistake
created massive intractable problems downstream. One issue alone,
Kurdish seperatism was largely triggered because of the crooked
"Turkish" identity and ended up costing the state 1.8 trillion dollars
over 40+ years. Even if this issue is somehow "solved" today, the
damage has been massive. Anatolians did that to themselves.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lowry: "In one generation the explanation for the question of the
identity of the early Ottomans had been transformed from one which
styled them as an admixture of Islamicized Byzantines and Turks
(Gibbons); to Turks who attracted a large number of Byzantine converts
to their banner due primarily to the heterodox form of Islam they
practiced (Langer/Blake); to an amalgam of Turkish tribes and groups
whose administrative skills were inherited from earlier Turkish states
in Anatolia, the Seljuks, and the Ilhanids (Köprülü); and finally, to
a group of dedicated Muslim gazis who came together for the express
purpose of fighting and converting the Christian infidels in the
border marches of northwest Anatolia (Wittek)...</p>
<p>Somewhat paradoxically, while on one hand denouncing Gibbons’ theory
as 'groundless speculation,' Inalcık seemingly adopted its underlying
argument in 1973, when he stressed (as had Wittek) that a common
background tied together the Byzantine frontier troops with the Muslim
gazis and that this led to assimilation. All this in turn shaped what
he described as: '</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a true 'Frontier Empire,' a cosmopolitan state, treating all creeds
and races as one, which was to unite the Orthodox Christian Balkans
and Muslim Anatolia in a single state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inalcık leaves unanswered one key question: What were the factors in
the early fourteenth century (prior to the advance into the Balkans)
which had served to unite the Bithynian Christians and Muslims into a
single state? While citing the role played by one Byzantine Greek,
Köse Mihal, who joins forces with the Ottoman rulers Osman and Orhan
'as a famous example of the process of assimilation,' he states that
this Köse (beardless) Mihal was a 'Gazi' and 'a Greek frontier lord
who accepted Islam.' I have encountered no source which alleges that
Mihal was a Muslim prior to the closing years of the reign of Osman
(1299–1324). Less clear are the reasons behind Inalcık’s insistence on
making Köse Mihal a Muslim"</p>
