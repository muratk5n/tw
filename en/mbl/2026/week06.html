<h1>Week 6</h1>
<p>No, Xi is not a minor princeling. Other princelings tend to be sons,
nephews of a Mao general, but generals are dime a dozen. Xi's father
did no one else could, he gave the Red Army refuge when they were down
on their knees, in a bad shape, facing certain ruin. Xi Zhongxun saved
them. IMO that makes his son one of the top princelings.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is interesting China, despite living under a system that enforced
equality for many years, still has an informal pseudo-royalty ranking
system within its party, I am talking about their "princelings".
Basically closeness to Mao in history imbues a man with added
rizz, they get status via that association.</p>
<hr />
<p>We can't blame the banks on the lending capacity issue.. The debacle
demonstrates that fundamental changes need to be systemic not nibbling
around the edges. If banks are to be supplanted, harming everything
<em>else</em> done by banks is a risk.</p>
<hr />
<p>The idea was since stablecoins are backed by treasuries which earn
interest, why not pass that interest along to the customer who holds
the coin? That was good choice. But it was too good for the banks'
comfort, they lobbied heavily against the crypto bill and managed to
kill it. They had a clause inserted discouraging yield offerings which
negated a big purpose of the bill.</p>
<p>"[1/15] Bank of America CEO.. warned that interest-bearing stablecoins
could pull as much as $6 trillion out of the US banking system,
arguing that large-scale deposit migration would reduce lending
capacity and push borrowing costs higher."</p>
<hr />
<p>"The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and Virginia-class submarine are two
of the U.S. Navy’s most sophisticated vessels. The destroyer uses
about 2,600 kg of [rare earth elements], while the submarine demands a
whopping 4,600 kg. These elements support radar, sonar, missile
guidance, and propulsion systems critical for both offensive and
defensive missions.. While these elements are crucial to U.S. defense,
more than 70% of REE imports come from China"</p>
<hr />
<p>Yahoo Finance: "Larry Fink critiqued capitalism during his opening
remarks at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. 'Capitalism has
focused wealth in the hands of a narrow minority since the end of the
Cold War', said the BlackRock CEO."</p>
<hr />
<p>Ortayli counts Bernard Lewis as one of his influences.. I call him Bernard "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1033089910971012713">Time for Toppling</a>"
Lewis. Rabid neo. </p>
<hr />
<p>Yes this is the same University of Chicago that gave rise to "Chicago
School of Economics", basically the neolib, Reaganist agenda. There are
always bizarre things going on over there. </p>
<hr />
<p>Inalcik found acceptance in the West (esp. Uni. of Chicago); migration
theories that favored <a href="../../2020/07/migrations-anatolia.html">one migration over others</a>
as an ideology was useful for the Anglo. By placing him on a pedestal
they encouraged an army of followers to continue his
research. Remember the nationalist narrative has an "alien" Turk who
arrives Asia Minor, builds civilisation where non existed, later
backstabbed by bad Arabs (don't like them, stay away from their
region), and always try to reconnect with distant cousins in Asia
(stirring shit up in Russia and China's backyard).</p>
<hr />
<p>Koprulu, Inalcik made a lot of mistakes.. But they were "useful",
that's why they were "state sponsored historians". Inalcik's student
Ortayli, though not as bright as his elders, found some renown in
local nationalist circles. They help advancing the nationalist project
of 1923. But, like Giordano Bruno said "if the first button of a man's
coat is wrongly buttoned, all the rest are sure to be crooked.". That
has always been the problem of the TR project, their initial mistake
created massive intractable problems downstream. One issue alone,
Kurdish seperatism was largely triggered because of the crooked
"Turkish" identity and ended up costing the state 1.8 trillion dollars
over 40+ years. Even if this issue is somehow "solved" today, the
damage has been massive. Anatolians did that to themselves.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lowry: "In one generation the explanation for the question of the
identity of the early Ottomans had been transformed from one which
styled them as an admixture of Islamicized Byzantines and Turks
(Gibbons); to Turks who attracted a large number of Byzantine converts
to their banner due primarily to the heterodox form of Islam they
practiced (Langer/Blake); to an amalgam of Turkish tribes and groups
whose administrative skills were inherited from earlier Turkish states
in Anatolia, the Seljuks, and the Ilhanids (Köprülü); and finally, to
a group of dedicated Muslim gazis who came together for the express
purpose of fighting and converting the Christian infidels in the
border marches of northwest Anatolia (Wittek)...</p>
<p>Somewhat paradoxically, while on one hand denouncing Gibbons’ theory
as 'groundless speculation,' Inalcık seemingly adopted its underlying
argument in 1973, when he stressed (as had Wittek) that a common
background tied together the Byzantine frontier troops with the Muslim
gazis and that this led to assimilation. All this in turn shaped what
he described as: '</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a true 'Frontier Empire,' a cosmopolitan state, treating all creeds
and races as one, which was to unite the Orthodox Christian Balkans
and Muslim Anatolia in a single state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inalcık leaves unanswered one key question: What were the factors in
the early fourteenth century (prior to the advance into the Balkans)
which had served to unite the Bithynian Christians and Muslims into a
single state? While citing the role played by one Byzantine Greek,
Köse Mihal, who joins forces with the Ottoman rulers Osman and Orhan
'as a famous example of the process of assimilation,' he states that
this Köse (beardless) Mihal was a 'Gazi' and 'a Greek frontier lord
who accepted Islam.' I have encountered no source which alleges that
Mihal was a Muslim prior to the closing years of the reign of Osman
(1299–1324). Less clear are the reasons behind Inalcık’s insistence on
making Köse Mihal a Muslim"</p>

<p>It sounds like 2D trust vectoring (eg up and down) would be more
efficient than 3D. Simplifies design and you can still get 3D
vectoring by additional maneuvering. #J-50</p>

<p>They call the Chinese J-50 the "carrier killer"?</p>
