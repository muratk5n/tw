Egypt must be eyeing the situation, the power balance, said no to UAE
bcz of their recent loss.

'Egypt.. announced its firm rejection of any offer aimed at selling
its stake in Alexandria Container and Cargo Handling Company [to
UAE]... Founded in 1984 and listed on the stock exchange since
1995..ACCHC.. is Egypt’s largest container terminal operator. It runs
two main terminals at the ports of Alexandria and El Dekheila [on
Suez]"

Apparently STC (and their backer UAE) has been warned many times to
stay away from Saudi red lines, they did not listen, so ended up on
the receiving end of Saudi attacks.

Middle East Forum: "Saudi Arabia Turns Its Guns on an Ally.. The fight
is over the 'Triangle of Power' — the oil and gas fields of Marib,
Shabwa, and Hadramout. Riyadh envisions a pipeline from the Empty
Quarter to the Arabian Sea to bypass the Iranian-threatened Strait of
Hormuz. An independent, UAE-controlled South Yemen sitting on that
pipeline route is a strategic non-starter for the House of Saud."

Robin Brooks: "Department store sales have collapsed in the US.. I
wrote.. about the 'retail apocalypse,' the phenomenon whereby online
shopping has been hollowing out brick and mortar retail. The pandemic
made this apocalypse even more acute, because it forced households
that had resisted online shopping to take the plunge and they’ve never
gone back."

"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social

Whether Waymo, etc, can eventually compete on price depends on the
reasons they are more expensive now.  My own guess would be they're
not even trying at present to recover development costs - just
minimise operational losses to keep investment flowing.

But the higher prices of Waymos raise a lot of broader issues for
Europeans.  A disruptive technology doesn't need to be competitive to
ruin an existing excellent service - as we've seen for example with
private postal services cherry-picking the most lucrative niches, but
in so doing rendering the universal service more and more expensive.
Who pays this price ?  - the elderly or disabled customers that need
help getting in and out of the car ?

A larger frame of reference would also imply analysis of other aspects
- the loss of human contact, help in emergencies, loss of drivers'
spending and tax in local economies, and the routing of those funds to
distant lands, or tax havens..."

This is a little known but deadly serious problem with LLMs.. Anyone
who used LLMs for scientific work will know they make a lot of
mistakes when citing work. I've seen multiple instance where LLM says
such and such idea / theory can be found in Book X page Y, you look,
the explanation is not there. The reason must LLM's internal
structure. They "approximately compress" knowledge, so when it
decompresses to an actual source it can lose information on the
way. It starts to hallunicate, making things up.

The Lever: "They Lobbied, Venezuela Burned... Before Trump’s invasion
of Venezuela, oil giants, global creditors, and cryptocurrency firms
lobbied on sanctions and access to the resource-rich nation... Chevron
is currently the only U.S.-based holder of a general waiver granting
the fossil fuel firm permission to broadly operate in Venezuela’s vast
oil fields, which represent about 17 percent of world’s global supply.

Disclosures filed on behalf of Mare Finance Investment Holdings, an
Ireland-based creditor, reveal the company spent $240,000 lobbying in
the first three quarters of 2025 on a single issue: 'Interest in OFAC
licensing for purposes of enforcing portion of an award against
Venezuelan assets.' That means the firm is likely seeking
U.S. permission to do business in the country so it can pursue
settlement money it’s owed by the Maduro government."

international court proceedings and provide a windfall to corporate
plaintiffs... Just weeks before the American military operation in
Venezuella to capture Maduro, the US energy giant Haliburton filed an
unusual lawsuit in internatioal court claiming the Venezuelan
government owed them damages for US sanctions against the country"

---

Euronews: "From Maduro's 'tigress' to Venezuela's interim president:
Who is Delcy Rodríguez? [Her father] José Antonio Rodríguez, the
patriarch of a family that would later come to shape the trajectory of
Venezuela’s socialist journey, was an active student leader.. He later
co-founded the Socialist League, a marginal political party that
rejected electoral politics and actively promoted abstention and the
null vote...

[In 1976] José Antonio Rodríguez was arrested by officers of the
Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP). He died
in police custody after what his family alleges was torture. His
youngest daughter, Delcy, was seven at the time."

---

Probably true: US presidents become frustrated w the domestic
opposition, internal checks and balances, over time most start to work
on foreign policy in a disproportionate manner bcz they have a freer
rein there.

---

Only if Russia brought back the Warsaw Pact, somehow added Bolivia,
Peru, Brazil, Columbia to it, later announced it is considering to
include Venezuella as well, which promptly started to bomb its
'minority Americans' on its territory, then US could be right to say
"wait a minute, what's going on here, should I step in?". In that case
the situation would be similar to Russia / Ukraine.

---

Ukraine is more than Russia's backyard. It is gateway to its capital
city. No one was rolling into Latin America and adding countries to a
distant military alliance either.

---

Venezuella's situation is not the same as Ukraine (ie US "had to act"
bcz foreign powers were encroaching on its backyard).

Responsible Statecraft: "Big investors jockeying for potential
Venezuela oil rush.. Regime change has opened the door for hedge funds
and Trump allies to cash in.. But it’s Paul Singer, a major Trump
donor, who is set to be one of the biggest winners..

Singer is.. a major Trump donor, having donated $5 million to Trump’s
super PAC and 1 million to defeat one of Trump’s fiercest Republican
critics, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). Singer has been called a
'vulture' for his tactic of buying up distressed assets, sometimes
assisted by longtime ally Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In 2016,
then-Senator Rubio pressured Argentina into a payment of 4.6 billion
to Singer and other creditors to settle debt they had bought,
according to journalist Greg Pallast."

The Cradle: "Pro-Israel billionaire Paul Singer is.. expected to reap
a significant windfall from the [Venezuella] operation. In November, a
US court awarded his firm, Elliott Management, control of the assets
of CITGO, the US subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil firm, PDVSA.

With Maduro gone, Singer can begin importing Venezuelan crude and
converting it to fuel at CITGO's refineries along the US Gulf Coast in
Louisiana and Texas."

---

Fortune: "[2025/09] Founded 115 years ago in Oklahoma, Citgo Petroleum
is a quintessentially American oil and gas brand. Except, of course,
that it’s been quietly and entirely owned by Venezuela since 1990..

Now, the decade-long legal saga over the fate of the Houston-based oil
refiner could soon end through a drawn-out, legal auction to pay off
creditors who lost oil assets, mining rights, and more when they were
expropriated.. [one of] the finalists [is] activist investor group
Elliott Investment Management..

At stake is Citgo’s 800,000-barrel-a-day refining network with
refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois, as well as a series of
pipelines and terminals, and branding and fuel marketing deals with
4,000 independently owned retail outlets throughout the East Coast,
Midwest, and South...

The legal fight between Venezuela and its creditors brewed for years
until 2018 when a small, defunct Canadian mining company, Crystallex,
won a federal court ruling saying it could pursue Citgo’s assets to
collect more than $1 billion it allegedly lost when Venezuela
expropriated assets in 2011."

Basel III made gold a Tier 1 asset, I wonder if they were aiming an
alternative currency to emerge out of that decision. Designers of Unit
exploited the BIII gold designation for sure. More institutions,
governments will hold gold now since it is, er, "good as gold", so why
not build something around that and stick it to SWIFT in the
meantime?

these pilots, suggest that billions of dollars have been spent on AI
experiments that never scale"

---

With the new BRICS 'Unit' the BRICS countries seem to have crossed
some kind of Rubicon, they showed they are serious on their goals.

---

There are many things going on at once in US.. Maga Lago Accords aims
to correct trade imbalance and depreciate the dollar, manage the
massive debt repayment problem, US also wants to remain as the reserve
currency would likely prefer the continuation of the petrodollar
system. Some of these goals could be contradictory.

---

Keynes disliked gold yes, he saw no need for it, but the Unit creators
were probably worrying about creating trust in their nascent system
quickly and gold can be a way to do that.

---

The main goal of Unit seems to be replacing SWIFT, creating an
alternative way for payments. That is a fine goal. I would still like
to see a true global currency though, like Bancor, which punishes
surplus countries as a feature of its construction.

---

You apparently cannot say 'pedophile' on the platform anymore so some
creators say "pdf file" to get around the control, using a code.

Corporate control can be worse than the government kind. Gov at least
needs to care about the public benefit at some level. Corps are under
no obligation to do so. If they capture the government, as they've
done in US, their adverse affects will multiply.

Politico: "[2025/12] The U.S. effort, led by the State Department, has
also gotten assistance from Evanan Romero, a former executive at the
Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela who now
works as a consultant in Houston..

Romero told POLITICO that the Trump administration’s outreach included
brokering a meeting in Washington in late November, led by Energy
Secretary Chris Wright, among Exxon, ConocoPhillips and
representatives of a Venezuelan opposition group to which Romero
belongs. The discussion centered on the possibility of the two oil
majors returning to the country.

Romero, who did not attend the meeting but was given a readout from
opposition group members, described the meeting as “positive” and said
Wright’s presence was “very, very helpful.” He said Exxon and
ConocoPhillips aired concerns about the debt they are owed from their
past Venezuela operations, and the Venezuelan representatives floated
the opportunity to take control of additional fields to compensate for
the debt."
