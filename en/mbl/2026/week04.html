<p>"The extent to which the [Peasants’ Revolt in 1381] frightened the
crown and nobility can be seen in the violence of Richard’s words when
he addressed another group of rebels at Walthamstow on 22 June, by
which time the danger was felt to have largely passed:</p>
<p>'You wretches, detestable on land and sea; you who seek equality with
lords are unworthy to live. Give this message to your colleagues.
Rustics you were and rustics you are still: you will remain in bondage
not as before but incomparably harsher. For as long as we live we will
strive to suppress you, and your misery will be an example in the eyes
of posterity.  How ever, we will spare your lives if you remain
faithful. Choose now which you want to follow'. (Simon Schama A
History of Britain p 254 )</p>

<p>On the Keating book - yes there are many aspects worth criticizing
Europe on some of their internal intransigence towards their US
cowtowing on esp. war/peace issues... We need to remember though the
entire governance elite of Europe formed during an era where that was
accepted, it was the norm. Such long-held stances are incredibly
difficult to change. My view is they will change when they need to, at
some point.</p>

ago, President Ronald Reagan promised to create a leak-proof defense
against incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Believe
it or not, the Pentagon has yet to even conduct a realistic test of
the system, which would involve attempting to intercept hundreds of
warheads traveling at 1,500 miles per hour, surrounded by realistic
decoys that would make it hard to even know which objects to target."</p>

<p>Need to distinquish between religion conversion and Turkification. TR
Republic emphasized the latter, conflating both where it was suitable,
and deemphasized the former when it ran against its secularization
project. It played word games to create a smokescreen, constructing a
bizarre racial basis for a country which historically had none of
it. Turkification was a political and linguistic veneer over an
ancient Anatolian core.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lowry’s research into the Defterology (tax registers) supports this:
He tracks families over generations. You can see a "George, son of
Michael" in one register, and in the next, his son is "Mehmet, son of
George," and the grandson is "Mehmet, son of Abdullah.". While the
name and religion can change to Muslim (later mistakenly conflated
with Turkishness -more on that later-) the family's internal culture,
local knowledge, and genetic makeup would have remained 100%
Anatolian. Lowry’s work on Bursa and Trabzon shows that the "Ottoman"
style was a direct evolution of local Byzantine and Anatolian Seljuk
styles. The people converting to Islam were the same people who had
built the churches; they simply started building mosques with the same
hands and local aesthetics. Instead of erasing the existing system,
the Ottomans often kept Byzantine taxes and land-holding
patterns as well. They just renamed them.</p>
<hr />
<p>We need to mindful of "label affiliation" vs deeper culture of a
place. Conversions hide the fact that the culture is still dominant.
And the Asiatic influence in that conversion, seperate from religion,
was even less.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lowry’s most famous argument is that the early Ottoman state (the
1300s) was not a purely Turkish or Islamic entity. He calls it a
"plundering confederacy.". He documents how local Byzantine
aristocrats and peasants didn't just "surrender" - they
joined. Figures like Köse Mihal (a Byzantine Greek lord) became
high-ranking Ottoman leaders. And because these "new" Ottomans were
locals, they brought their administrative styles, land management
systems, and even culinary and social habits into the Ottoman system.</p>

<p>Caitlin Johnstone: "Zionist Billionaires Openly Acknowledge
Manipulating The US Government.. [A]s Saban said, it’s all
legal. Corruption is legal in the United States of America. Plutocrats
are allowed to leverage their fortunes to manipulate the US government
using campaign funding and lobbying for the advancement of their
personal, financial, and ideological agendas. If you have a few
million dollars to spare you can use them to make criminal charges go
away, to roll back environmental regulations or worker protections
which hurt the profit margins of your business, or even to get
military explosives shipped to a foreign government for use in an
ongoing genocide."</p>

<p>Tillman was likely killed by MIC for opposing the expansion of the war
into Iraq (shot by "friendly fire" -later covered up-). He wasn't high
in the chain of command but he had fame, his enrollment in the
military was a big deal at the time, a figure like that coming against
the Iraq War from the trenches of Afghanistan would have undermined
the war propaganda. The post below rolls Israel into the argument via
Schnozz. A sign of increased vitriol. Israel can now be included into
any and all blame for US misdeeds, mostly deserved. The system caused
this to happen. Victimization arbitrage stopped working.</p>

<p>Lowry: "[Researcher] Arnakis touched on the major weaknesses of
[another] thesis by emphasizing that the connotation of the title
<em>gazi</em> in that context did not mean that the early Ottomans were
motivated by the goal of converting the Bithynian Christians, but
rather by amassing plunder, slaves, and booty. He argued persuasively
that in the conquest of Bithynia, which stretched over half a century,
there simply was no manifestation of Islamic fanaticism. To the
contrary, he pointed out that the Ottomans initially encountered a
peasantry which had been abused by their Byzantine rulers with a
resultant loss of morale. He stressed the lenient attitude of the
Ottomans which facilitated widespread conversion and subsequent
[label] assimilation.  Ultimately, Arnakis highlighted the fact that
the physical growth and success of the early Ottoman state can be
directly linked to its absorption of the indigenous Greek population
of Bithynia."</p>
<hr />
<p>Gibbons, Lowry are major researchers in this area FYI</p>
<hr />
<p>That makes sense for anyone who knows the mechanics of assimilation
which is about 1) numbers and 2) proximity. While peoples of Asia
Minor accepted a "label conversion", the deeper culture would have
stayed and assimilate the group that was fewer in number. The
minority, the migrant in this case were the Turks (real ones, not the
fake ones mislabeled after 1923). The proof is in the genetic pudding,
~10% Asiatic.</p>
<p>Heath Lowry, <em>The Nature of the Early Ottoman State</em>: "[M]any Western
specialists in the next generation continued to accept the basic
thrust of Gibbons’ argument, namely, that the Ottoman state was formed
by an amalgam of peoples which included a significant number of local
western-Anatolian and Balkan-Christian converts to Islam... Gibbons’
argument [was that the Ottomans were] formed from a commingling of
Byzantine, Slavic, and Turkish peoples"</p>
