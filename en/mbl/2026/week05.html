<p>Some commentators might be confusing which purge was done by whom. The

he could continue to serve as president beyond his term limit. The

<p>Subir Sarkar: "In the standard model of cosmology, about seventy
percent of the energy density of the universe—the dark energy driving
its accelerating rate of expansion - is described by Albert Einstein’s
cosmological constant. In this essay, I argue that the standard model
of cosmology is wrong...</p>
<p>[I]n quantum field theory, all contributions to the vacuum energy can
be formally canceled order by order by adding appropriate counterterms
to the Lagrangian. This would have no effect on any quantity measured
in the laboratory. It is only when the standard model of particle
physics is supplemented by gravity that the quantum vacuum can have a
possible effect on the universe as a whole.</p>
<p>When these implications were first realized in the 1930s, they were
quickly swept under the rug. '[A]s is obvious from experience,' Pauli
confidently remarked, 'the [zero-point energy] does not produce any
gravitational field.'..</p>
<p>Pauli offered no reason why the vacuum energy density should not
gravitate, and overlooked, or ignored, the obvious conflict with
general relativity. In Einstein’s theory, all forms of energy must
gravitate.</p>

<p>Ex-Tory Home Secretary Suella Braverman defects to Reform UK... It's
clear that the UK Tory Party is splitting - a split that started over
brexit, included Boris Johnson's expulsion of 21 pro-Europe MPs, and
now the drift away to ReformUK.</p>
<p>What's driving it?  The last Tory split like this, over the Corn
Laws, resulted in a generation out of power and Peel's reformulation
of conservatism in more-or-less its modern form, as the party of
business.  This split was understood at the time in terms of policies
and personalities (as politics generally is) - but in reality the
division was driven by the divergence of economic interests between
the landowners (who wanted to keep food prices high so enable them to
collect more rent from farming) and the interests of industrialists
(who wanted low food prices so they could pay workers less).</p>
<p>So if it's conflicts of economic interests in the underlying electoral
coalition that is similarly driving the split unfolding now - what are
these conflicting interests ?</p>
<p>I think Boris Johnson told us when, in the brexit debates, he
shockingly said 'Fuck Business' - because the business world was
itself split over brexit, between serious smaller businesses,
entrepreneurs that wanted stability, predictability, sensible
regulation - and City 'investors', 'disaster capitalists', that move
money around globally, and whose gambling and tax-evasion actually
requires unpredictability, instability and the global
free-market-race-to-the-bottom.  Certainly not the EU.</p>
<p>It's the return of the contradiction at the heart of Peel's
conservatism: representing the interests of those with wealth and
privilege in the current capitalist social formation, while capitalism
itself actually insists on constant change and instability."</p>

That gives you a guage showing how serious the opposition is. And
surely they crossed the line, the Rubicon. Then Xi would obtain both a

<p>"According to Zadeh, the U.S. drive toward war and military aggression
is often dictated by internal, self-expanding dynamics rather than
immediate external provocations. He argues that the timing of
U.S. military actions is driven by several key factors within the
'military-industrial-Likud alliance'.</p>
<p>The Survival of the Military-Industrial Complex</p>
<p>The MIC has evolved from a means of national security into an end in
itself. Unlike past empires where arms production was dictated by war
requirements, the private, market-driven character of the U.S. arms
industry means that profit imperatives now drive the demand for
war. This 'parasitic imperialism' requires occasional 'shooting wars'
to draw down stockpiles of armaments, display the efficiency of new
'smart' weapons, and justify the military's continued appropriation of
the lion’s share of public money.</p>
<p>The Invention of 'External Threats'</p>
<p>A central hallmark of U.S. militarism is the constant need to invent
or manufacture external threats to justify high levels of military
spending.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Post-Cold War Necessity: Following the collapse of the Soviet Union,
  the U.S. could no longer use the 'communist threat' to maintain the
  military budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substituted Enemies: To stifle demands for 'peace dividends', the
  military-industrial complex substituted new enemies such as 'rogue
  states,' 'global terrorism'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9/11 as Opportunity: The sources argue that the 9/11 attacks were
  treated as a 'war on America' rather than a criminal act
  specifically because it provided a 'transformative moment' to reduce
  public resistance to overseas military involvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Economic Stimulus and 'Military Keynesianism'</p>
<p>The timing of military expansion is often linked to cycles of economic
slowdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Antirecession Tool: Proponents of militarism use military spending
  as a fiscal instrument to boost aggregate demand when
  private-sector spending dwindles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution of Wealth: Increased military adventures are seen as
  a strategy to redistribute national resources in favor of the
  wealthy and the military establishment while cutting public spending
  on socioeconomic infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historical Pattern: Drastic increases in military spending in the
  early 1950s, early 1980s, and early 2000s all occurred on the heels
  of recessionary cycles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Geopolitical Recasting and the Likud Alliance</p>
<p>We can identify a de facto alliance between the MIC and militant
Zionist proponents of 'greater Israel'.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Convergence of Interests: Both groups benefit from war and political
  convulsion in the Middle East to achieve their respective goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regime Change Agenda: Plans to invade Iraq and recast the map of the
  Middle East were drawn up by neoconservative strategists long
  before the 9/11 attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>World War IV: Leading ideologues described in the sources argue that
  the U.S. is engaged in a protracted 'World War IV' (III being the
  Cold War) against militant Islam, using 'preemptive strikes' to
  oversee the emergence of successor governments amenable to U.S. and
  Israeli interests."</p>

<p>The latest report matches the internal struggle scenario we wrote
about recently. A conflict has been raging between Zhang and Xi, and
according to some leaks, Zhang finally turned up the heat and planned
an overt coup, Xi was to be arrested at a hotel in January 18. But Xi
received intel, left the hotel early, while leaving an armed
contingent behind. Then, "[a] gunfight broke out at the Jingxi Hotel
between Zhang’s people, who had already arrived, and forces arranged
by Xi. Nine of Xi’s personal security guards were killed, while dozens
of Zhang Youxia’s people were killed.". Major action.</p>

thorium is so much better than uranium, why the U.S. abandoned thorium
in the 1960s–70s why did we shutter this thing in in the 70s?  Why did
we go down the uranium path and not the thorium path?'"</p>
<p>Sorensen: "I spent years finding the answer to that myself. I ended up
writing my thesis at the University of Tennessee on the very
question. The really short answer is, very early on, our priority was
weapons and thorium was not a path to weapons... And so much work had
been done on uranium and plutonium versus thorium that it was more
ready to be demonstrated. And so the efforts of the Nixon and Carter
and Reagan administrations went into what was called the Clinch River
Breeder Reactor around uranium, plutonium and thorium was
shelved. That was a bad move. That was a mistake. We really should
have been continuing the work of Dr. Weinberg at at Oakidge and and
pushing the thorium direction. He correctly foresaw the problems that
we would run into with the uranium approach in every facet, both in
safety and in ultimate fuel utilization. And he would have not been
one bit surprised to be here in 2025 with us right now going 'I could
have told you you'd be in this problem way back when because you
didn't take the the thorium direction'."</p>
<p>Taggart: "So okay so uranium essentially is a less efficient fuel. it
has more safety issues.. but it offered the opportunity for
weaponization and I'm guessing because of the interest of the
military-industrial complex, [they] really pushed for that and then
once we had enough momentum around that technology it just became
easier to continue that momentum than to try to go back to the drawing
board with thorium"</p>
