is over the 'Triangle of Power' — the oil and gas fields of Marib,
Shabwa, and Hadramout. Riyadh envisions a pipeline from the Empty

<p>"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social</p>
<p>Whether Waymo, etc, can eventually compete on price depends on the
reasons they are more expensive now.  My own guess would be they're
not even trying at present to recover development costs - just
minimise operational losses to keep investment flowing.</p>
<p>But the higher prices of Waymos raise a lot of broader issues for
Europeans.  A disruptive technology doesn't need to be competitive to
ruin an existing excellent service - as we've seen for example with
private postal services cherry-picking the most lucrative niches, but
in so doing rendering the universal service more and more expensive.
Who pays this price ?  - the elderly or disabled customers that need
help getting in and out of the car ?</p>
<p>A larger frame of reference would also imply analysis of other aspects
- the loss of human contact, help in emergencies, loss of drivers'
spending and tax in local economies, and the routing of those funds to
distant lands, or tax havens..."</p>

Peru, Brazil, Columbia to it, later announced it is considering to
include Venezuella as well, which promptly started to bomb its

"wait a minute, what's going on here, should I step in?". In that case
the situation would be similar to Russia / Ukraine.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Cradle: "Pro-Israel billionaire Paul Singer is.. expected to reap
a significant windfall from the [Venezuella] operation. In November, a
US court awarded his firm, Elliott Management, control of the assets
of CITGO, the US subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil firm, PDVSA.</p>
<p>With Maduro gone, Singer can begin importing Venezuelan crude and
converting it to fuel at CITGO's refineries along the US Gulf Coast in
Louisiana and Texas."</p>
<hr />
<p>Fortune: "[2025/09] Founded 115 years ago in Oklahoma, Citgo Petroleum

that it’s been quietly and entirely owned by Venezuela since 1990..</p>

refiner could soon end through a drawn-out, legal auction to pay off
creditors who lost oil assets, mining rights, and more when they were
expropriated.. [one of] the finalists [is] activist investor group
Elliott Investment Management..</p>
<p>At stake is Citgo’s 800,000-barrel-a-day refining network with
refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois, as well as a series of
pipelines and terminals, and branding and fuel marketing deals with
4,000 independently owned retail outlets throughout the East Coast,
Midwest, and South...</p>
<p>The legal fight between Venezuela and its creditors brewed for years
until 2018 when a small, defunct Canadian mining company, Crystallex,
won a federal court ruling saying it could pursue Citgo’s assets to
collect more than $1 billion it allegedly lost when Venezuela
expropriated assets in 2011."</p>

<p>Basel III made gold a Tier 1 asset, I wonder if they were aiming an
alternative currency to emerge out of that decision. Designers of Unit
exploited the BIII gold designation for sure. More institutions,
governments will hold gold now since it is, er, "good as gold", so why
not build something around that and stick it to SWIFT in the
meantime?</p>

<p>With the new BRICS 'Unit' the BRICS countries seem to have crossed
some kind of Rubicon, they showed they are serious on their goals.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are many things going on at once in US.. Maga Lago Accords aims
to correct trade imbalance and depreciate the dollar, manage the
massive debt repayment problem, US also wants to remain as the reserve
currency would likely prefer the continuation of the petrodollar
system. Some of these goals could be contradictory.</p>
<hr />
<p>Keynes disliked gold yes, he saw no need for it, but the Unit creators
were probably worrying about creating trust in their nascent system
quickly and gold can be a way to do that.</p>
<hr />
<p>The main goal of Unit seems to be replacing SWIFT, creating an
alternative way for payments. That is a fine goal. I would still like
to see a true global currency though, like Bancor, which punishes
surplus countries as a feature of its construction.</p>
<hr />
<p>You apparently cannot say 'pedophile' on the platform anymore so some
creators say "pdf file" to get around the control, using a code.</p>
<p>Corporate control can be worse than the government kind. Gov at least
needs to care about the public benefit at some level. Corps are under
no obligation to do so. If they capture the government, as they've
done in US, their adverse affects will multiply.</p>

<p>Romero, who did not attend the meeting but was given a readout from
opposition group members, described the meeting as “positive” and said
Wright’s presence was “very, very helpful.” He said Exxon and
ConocoPhillips aired concerns about the debt they are owed from their

the opportunity to take control of additional fields to compensate for
the debt."</p>
