<p>Politico: "Republicans finally have a health care plan.. Conservatives
who sought free-market solutions to America’s exorbitant medical bills
in an era before President Donald Trump, and struggled to come up with
a plan to replace Obamacare in his first term, would be surprised to
see what’s in it."</p>
<hr />
<p>Bin Ladin was the quintessential Islamist. This is why "Saudi
financing of 9/11" narrative never took hold - everyone understood
where he came from and what he was, he would be seen no different than
Mohammed Morsi later in the eyes of the Gulf monarchies. He was
anti-elite, probably saw them infidels of sorts, wanted to topple
them. Him being partly outside the existing elite structure of his
country makes sense that way, Robert Fisk describes Osama as a Saudi
"of humbler Yemeni descent". He was not "crème de la crème", inside
but not exactly... He was an aspiring elite wanting to displace the
existing one using a cultural construct (Islam) that is held dear by
many.</p>
<hr />
<p>If religions are political statements and all true religions carry
left ideas at their core, why do they become problematic in the
Islamic world between its political practitioners and their rulers?</p>
<p>Point of comparison: Christianity. It started as a spiritual
rebellion, persecuted by the rulers (Rome) then accepted by the elites
who later became Christians. The religion spread, it preached, had its
internal wars and external ones (via Crusades).</p>
<p>Maybe Islam is seen as problematic because (due to its relative
youth?)  it preaches to an elite and society which already accepted /
adopted a lot of its message, but Islamists might be seen as if they
are fighting a <em>Crusade</em> against their own rulers, labeling them at
times as infidels, doing this at the 11th hour...  The problem is not
one of political angle, it is one of intensity, and or at least
perceived intensity. Communists could be militant, extreme but with
any religion based politics claiming God on your side can turn the
volume up a notch.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hope the new show follows the style of SGA. Don't try to be too

assassination of Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba in 1961 to
the butchering of hundreds of thousands of suspected communist

<p>You can see traces of Islamism vs Gulf monarchies tension even in
Sudan. Listen to Hemeti (RSF leader), when the recent civil war
started he blamed the other side, Sudanese Army SAF, to be composed of
"Islamists". Obviously SAF chief Burhan, now allied with Egypt, is no
Islamist. Hemeti says that because he knows that word carries weight
in the Gulf. The previous leader of Sudan, Bashir, was supported by
Islamists, and UAE did not like him (they might have financed the coup
to topple him -SAF and RSF both played a role in that-).</p>

<hr />
<p>Morsi's constitution in Egypt was not democratic. They would likely
morph into an "Islamic Ba'ath" in the future, over time even the
Islamic part would fade away and the country would be left with just
Ba'ath. I guess neighboring monarchies saw through that and simply
financed the other side... Why wait for Ba'ath tomorrow when you can
have Ba'ath today?</p>
<p>It was a great big debacle.. Such a waste of time, lives and
resources.</p>
<hr />
<p>Spreading of democracy would be supported by the US
military-industrial complex. The undertaking created chaos, lead to
war, increasing their profits. MIC made bank thanks to the Arab Spring
and its aftermath.</p>
<hr />
<p>See the book <em>Strategic Depth</em> by Davutoglu (FM, and later PM). It was
published on April 2001, and Davutoglu, the one-man think-tank, was
seen as the inspiration for AK foreign policy. He described the Arab
World being in a "legitimacy crisis".. The West probably read that and
thought "Aha! Let's use these guys to stir shit up in the Arab world".</p>
<hr />
<p>How did it all start? Post Sep 11 2001 US wanted to "bring democracy"
to the Middle East. The starting point was TR, via 2002 election saw
AKP with its Islamic roots winning the election.  Its leader had a
legal issue at the time, but Dubya admin pulled all the stops to give
him legitimacy, inviting him to White House wout an official title. TR
from then on assumed the mantle of "democracy spreader" in the region,
supporting Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and other places. The narrative
also helped with its own internal fight with its meddlesome
military. TR-US together fanned the flames of uprisings in the Middle
East.</p>
<p>But that stance put them at odds with the Gulf monarchies, Saudi had a
TR ally Khasoggi killed in the Istanbul embassy, UAE provided
financing against AKP, against Muslim Brotherhood (AK ally), they
succeeded toppling Mohammad Morsi. Afterwards the sore loser TR prime
minister would go around the country flashing the MB "<a href="https://cdn.fosstodon.org/media_attachments/files/115/897/804/151/196/356/original/28e33d0c9570c981.jpg">Rabia sign</a>"
in speeches but it was too late.</p>
<p>Today is a different world. The Arab Spring is dead. Now TR is not
trying to "spread democracy" in the Gulf, but itself seems to be
becoming more like a pre-9/11 Syria, or Iraq (the opposition leader is
in jail). The toppling of Syria's regime is not a great success for TR
either, pre civil war it could have close relations with them anyway,
now it has to contend with a faction inside it, not to mention a
massive refuge crisis.</p>
<hr />
<p>Watched a Muslim Brotherhood fan rooting for TR-Saudi alliance. He was
glad Saudi beating up on UAE, took it as a sign of justification for
their cause. That is an overreach. UAE funded coups against the
Brotherhood, against the Arab Spring uprisings all over the globe,
that's correct, but there are no signs Saudis would not do the same if
they wanted to take the lead at the time. No monarchy would tolerate
MB type movements, which were supposedly democratic organisations that
pandered to "people power" trying to displace their monarchic elites.</p>
<hr />

too. And joined by UAE? There are some interesting groupings these
days.</p>

<p>Reaganism, neoliberalism is a spent force. Already the econ is as
pro-corporate it can be and it still destroys peoples lives while it
produces 50 different types of candy cane. Therefore any advances, any
improvements of any kind that will help people will necessarily have
to go against corporate interests. The only good solutions at this
point are (economic) left wing solutions.</p>

interest rates.</p>
<p>In her speech on Monday at the National Press Club on the Democratic
party’s future, Warren said she made clear that if the president
'really wants to get something done, including capping credit card
interest rates or lowering housing costs, he would use his leverage
and pick up the phone.'</p>
<p>'President Trump and Sen. Warren had a productive call about credit

<hr />
<p>IC: "Netanyahu and leading figures within his extremist coalition
repeatedly claimed that Israel has already 'won' the war. If that is
the case, why insist on keeping the Gaza file open?.. </p>
<p>First, Netanyahu continues to gamble on the possibility that
international and regional opinion may eventually become receptive to
the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip—and
subsequently, from the occupied West Bank. Sustained warfare,
humanitarian collapse, and forced displacement are not unfortunate
byproducts of the conflict; they are essential mechanisms for keeping
that option alive and politically imaginable.</p>
<p>This logic explains Israel’s systematic manipulation of aid, including
its haggling over food, medicine, fuel, and cement. These items bear
little meaningful relationship to the strength of the Gaza
resistance. Their restriction is designed to keep Gazans suspended
between survival and death.</p>
<p>It also explains why Israel, after sustained pressure, agreed to open
the Rafah border crossing from only one side—out of Gaza. This, too,
is part of a broader scheme aimed at driving Palestinians out of the
Strip incrementally, supported by a well-funded political and
logistical machinery that has been operating for months.</p>
<p>Second, the genocidal war on Gaza is being actively exploited to
escalate conditions in the occupied West Bank. Under the cover of
regional war, Netanyahu and his coalition partners have accelerated
settlement expansion, intensified repression, and advanced a long-term
colonial project of de facto annexation with minimal international
scrutiny."</p>
<hr />
<p>Jim Rogers has a point. Thatcher was lucky to be in government when
North Sea oil revenue started pouring in. I add, then the relative
initial success Thatcher had wasn't due to her neoliberal economic

pro-low taxes when gov has enough revenue.</p>

<p>Juhasz: "Exxon was producing in Venezuela. So was ConocoPhillips. So
was Chevron. When the Chavez regime changed the terms and took greater
state control, Chevron accepted those terms. Exxon and ConocoPhillips
did not. Exxon and ConocoPhillips operations were then expropriated by
the Venezuelans. Exxon and ConocoPhillips believe that they are owed
money, and my guess is that part of what’s being negotiated is the
billions of dollars that they believe that they are owed, and then can
they come back in under terms that they can trust and are favorable to
them?</p>
<p>They [also] want greater access. Exxon is also operating in waters
offshore Guyana that Venezuela and Maduro claim as theirs. Maduro has
even sent military gunboats in to threaten Exxon. Marco Rubio was in
Guyana in March and said we will defend Exxon from Maduro. This is a
massive new production that Exxon started from scratch and has hardly
cost them a penny, because Guyana is fronting the bill...</p>
<p>This is all a negotiation. Now Chevron bought their way into offshore
Guyana. [Oil companies are] also interested in offshore Trinidad and
Tobago. They’re also interested in offshore Suriname."</p>

basically saying publicly, and the media is repeating it, 'We wouldn’t
want to operate in Venezuela. Oh, my God, it’s expensive, it’s
technologically complex.'  I actually think those are ridiculous
things if you look where else they operate."</p>

<p>Nassim Haramein refers to that passage below in the famous book
<em>Gravitation</em> to support his theories. His is a similar line of

Flandern, Putoff, Tim Boyer, Ana Maria Cetto, Luis de la Peña, all of
whom reference Sakharov. We made shares on this topic before. The
zero-point field angle was a known and legit alternative, the book
<em>Gravitation</em>, the bible of the field, a record of the known and
speculated at the time, rightfully mentions it.</p>

<p>Wheeler, <em>Gravitation</em>: "[Physicist] Sakharov notes that present-day

<p>UFOs, another similarity. DJT talked about UFOs, like Reagan. The UFO

account says Colin Powell (NSA at the time) sitting in the audience
once, when Reagan starts going off on aliens he rolls his eyes and
says "there we go with the little green men again". The no-nonsense

<p>"According to [.. Nassim Haramein], everything starts from vacuum
energy, and more specifically from 0-point energy; they extend the
proton model – whose mass, according to Nassim Haramein’s previous
work, takes vacuum energy into account – to the cosmological scale. In
this way, they establish a model for the creation of mass and forces,
and their mechanics. They then demonstrate that mass – and therefore
energy – are emergent properties of the fundamental dynamics of space
at the quantum scale, and that this energy then decays through a
mechanism known as screening, right up to the cosmological scale...</p>
<p>What if Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle were the consequence of
0-point energy, not its cause? An astonishing point of view, which
helps to maintain the coherence of quantum theory...</p>
<p>0-point energy, space and mass: Einstein’s field equations, which
describe how mass curves spacetime, naturally contain zero-point
energy… here we revisit the concepts of mass and space, including

<p>0-point energy screening and emergence of mass: Spacetime behaves more
like a superfluid of coherent quantum energy. Mass and gravity emerge
directly from this superfluid; it constitutes and models both space
and matter at all scales...</p>
<p>0-point energy, Planck force and gravity: The Planck force is the
keystone of Nassim Haramein’s gravitational model. It leads to a
reconsideration of gravity, which turns out to be a strong interaction
on the quantum scale, particularly in the context of the internal
structure of the proton…"</p>
