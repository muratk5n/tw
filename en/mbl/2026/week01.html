<p>China usually tries to one up the West on tech, science frontier by
making things bigger and better. If they don't see a future in LHC

that is bad news for that line of research. I hope EU follows suit,

<p>#LLM #JEPA</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Cis57hC3KcM?t=157">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Yann Le Cun: "One of the most important aspects of advanced machine
intelligence is the ability to understand the physical world that
surrounds us [which LLMs cannot do]. This ability enables AI systems
to learn, reason, plan and act in the real world in order to assist
humans [LeCun, 2022]...  Currently, the common approach to achieve
these tasks is to use large token-generative Vision Language Models
(VLMs).. which takes visual input $X_V$ , textual query $X_Q$ to
generate desired textual response Y autoregressively in token space,
i.e., $(X_V,X_Q) \to Y$.  This is straightforward but inadequate for
two main reasons. First, VLMs are expensive to develop, because they
are trained to generate responses..  to queries by capturing both
task-relevant semantics with task-irrelevant surface linguistic
features such as words choice, style or paraphrasing..</p>
<p>This paper introduces the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for
Vision-Language (VL-JEPA), turning expensive learning of data-space
token generation into more efficient latent-space semantic
prediction. Thanks to its non-generative nature, VL-JEPA is not forced
to reconstruct every surface detail of Y in the token space. Instead,
it only needs to predict the abstract representation $S_Y$ in the
embedding space"</p>

<p>Reddit: "I’m a developer for a major food delivery app... You guys
always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality
is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories. I’m
a backend engineer. I sit in the weekly sprint planning meetings where
Product Managers (PMs) discuss how to squeeze another 0.4% margin out
of "human assets" (that’s literally what they call drivers in the
database schemas). They talk about these people like they are resource
nodes in a video game, not fathers and mothers trying to pay rent.</p>
<p>First off, the 'Priority Delivery' is a total scam. It was pitched to
us as a 'psychological value add.' Like I said in the title, when you
pay that extra $2.99, it changes a boolean flag in the order JSON, but
the dispatch logic literally ignores it. It does nothing to speed you
up.</p>
<p>We actually ran an A/B test last year where we didn't speed up the
priority orders, we just purposefully delayed non-priority orders by 5
to 10 minutes to make the Priority ones "feel" faster by
comparison. Management loved the results. We generated millions in
pure profit just by making the standard service worse, not by making
the premium service better.</p>
<p>But the thing that actually makes me sick—and the main reason I’m
quitting—is the 'Desperation Score.' We have a hidden metric for
drivers that tracks how desperate they are for cash based on their
acceptance behavior.</p>
<p>If a driver usually logs on at 10 PM and accepts every garbage $3
order instantly without hesitation, the algo tags them as 'High
Desperation.' Once they are tagged, the system then deliberately stops
showing them high-paying orders. The logic is: "Why pay this guy 15
for a run when we know he’s desperate enough to do it for 6 dollars?"
We save the good tips for the "casual" drivers to hook them in and
gamify their experience, while the full-timers get grinded into dust."</p>
<hr />
<p>You do need capitalism, bidness for some things, they are like the
kelp organism in the ocean ecology. Recycle waste, filter some stuff,
convert one thing to another thing..  they can be beneficial. But they
do not constitute the core. The society, the media should not glorify
creating businesses, and portray being a businessman as automatically
a good thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Business is not even "the visible part of the iceberg" when it comes
to growth, economy, innovation... They are a tiny speck on the visible
part of the iceberg.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's true: businesses do not innovate, not the fundamental kind. They
can combine existing know-how together and come up with a product, but
they are far, far away from any type of genuine discoveries. Even the
recent "AI" advances, to the extent they represent an advance, were
made by an non-profit, not a commercial entity. Commercial incentives
are fundamentally at odds with true innovation.</p>

<p>Reuters: "[10/26] Colombian Senator Ivan Cepeda was elected to be the

<p>Cory Doctorow: "Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can
trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act
of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on
its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects.</p>
<p>This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls "Felony Contempt of
Business Model." Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998
when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA... every other country in the world
has passed a law just like this in the years since. Here in the EU, it
came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive.</p>
<p>Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like
this, after all, they are the world's tech powerhouse, home to the
biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it
illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer's
permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most
valuable companies on US stock exchanges.</p>
<p>But why would Europe pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech
importer. By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to
steal their users' data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way
transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this?</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which other
countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you'll
spot a pattern that will answer this question.</p>
<p>Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free
Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention
law.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade
Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention
laws.</p>
<p>Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through
bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact
anticircumvention laws.</p>
<p>And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws
through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA
– which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too.</p>
<p>I assume you've spotted the pattern by now: the US trade
representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt
anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own
people's data and money by American firms...</p>
<p>That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies
to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash.</p>
<p>The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but
we've got tariffs now!</p>
<p>[A] possible response to tariffs, one that's just sitting there,
begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law?</p>

<p>Leonid Levin: "There are many problems with [quantum computers]. For
instance, thermal isolation cannot be perfect. Tiny backgrounds of
neutrinos, gravitational waves, and other exotics, cannot be
shielded. Their effects on quantum amplitudes need not satisfy the
restrictions on which error-correcting tools depend. Moreover,
nondissipative computing gates, even classical, remain a
speculation. Decades past, their existence was cheerfully proclaimed
and even proved for worlds where the laws of physical interaction can
be custom-designed. In our world, where the electromagnetic
interaction between electrons, nuclei, and photons is about the only
one readily available, circuits producing less entropy than computing
remain hypothetical. So, low temperatures have limits and even a tiny
amount of heat can cause severe decoherence problems. Furthermore, the
uncontrollable degrees of freedom need not behave simply as
heat. Interaction with the intricately correlated q-bits may put them
in devilish states capable of conspiracies which defy imagination...</p>
<p>All such problems, however, are peanuts. The major problem is the
requirement that basic quantum equations hold to multi-hundredth if
not millionth decimal positions where the significant digits of the
relevant quantum amplitudes reside. We have never seen a physical law
valid to over a dozen decimals. Typically, every few new decimal
places require major rethinking of most basic concepts. Are quantum
amplitudes still complex numbers to such accuracies or do they become
quaternions, colored graphs, or sick-humored gremlins? I suspect
physicists would doubt even the laws of arithmetic pushed that far. In
fact, we know that the most basic laws cannot all be correct to
hundreds of decimals: this is where they stop being consistent with
each other!"</p>

<p>Clancy was a total Reagan bootlicker. According to his telling he owes
his success to him, Ronald read <em>The Hunt for Red October</em>,
recommended it and TC shot to fame almost overnight. Clancy as we know
was the master of the "techno-thriller", his stories featured lots of
gizmos most of which of course was used by the military.  Weapons
manufacturers must have salivated over every new Clancy publication.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tom Clancy's 1994 <em>Debt of Honor</em> was likely influenced by the
previous decade too.</p>

<p>Trade imbalances create animosity.. Japan was 80s' China, and there
was a lot of animosity towards them too. There was the fear that Japan
was "buying up stuff", the 1992 novel <em>Rising Sun</em> captures the era.

<p>The story is kind of like <em>Dune</em> isn't it? The forest instead of the
desert? Or Tarzan, forest dwellers instead of gorillas? A former noble
falls from grace, starts "slumming it" among thieves / apes / desert
fremen? Are we seeing the same story over and over again? </p>
<hr />
<p>Hopefully there is no hidden anti Europe propaganda buried in the
story. Normans were from mainland Europe after all.</p>

<p>Ah they have a lady who is "spirited", as the show calls it, she is

<hr />
<p>Add Lena Headey, some doggy, you basically have <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I like the historical backdrop of the new Robin Hood TV show. This
story usually begins with the hero already in the forest, doing his
thing.. But according to this more detailed backdrop, Hood's father is
from the displaced Saxon elite, he was displaced because the Norman
invasion. The father, a former noble, is made a "forester" (a huge
demotion), he manages the place, the new king's property, that would
give the kid a logical reason to be in and out of the "Sherwood"
forest, working towards his new status as the "prince of thieves".</p>
<p>The new take makes more sense, even if a RH did or did not truly live.
Robin Hood's later "robbing the rich give to the poor" acts will have
more urgency to them now because surely they will be robbing the "new
royalty", the invader Normans, and giving the money to the natives,
Saxons. They picked the perfect token Norman, Sean Bean.</p>
